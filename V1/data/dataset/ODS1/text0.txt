End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half  from 1.9 billion in 1990  to 836 million in 2015  too many people are still struggling to meet the most basic human needs.
Globally  more than 800 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day; many lack access to adequate food  clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid economic growth in countries like China and India has lifted millions out of poverty  but progress has been uneven. Women are disproportionately affected; they are more likely to live in poverty due to unequal access to paid work  education and property.
Progress has also been limited in other regions  such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  which account for 80 percent of the people living in extreme poverty. This rate is expected to rise due to new threats brought on by climate change  conflict and food insecurity.
TheSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a bold commitment to finish what we started  and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. In order to achieve the SDGs  we must target those living in vulnerable situations  increasing access to basic resources and services  and support communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.
Ending poverty is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across multiple goals.
