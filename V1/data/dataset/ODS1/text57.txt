Giving people in all parts of the world the support they need to lift themselves out of poverty in all its manifestations is the very essence of sustainable development. Goal 1 focuses on ending poverty through interrelated strategies  including the promotion of social protection systems  decent employment and the resilience of the poor. Although the global rate of extreme poverty has been reduced by more than half since 2000  intensified efforts are required to boost the incomes  alleviate the suffering and build the resilience of those still impoverished  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Social protection systems need to be expanded and risks mitigated for disaster-prone countries  which tend to be among the worlds poorest countries.
