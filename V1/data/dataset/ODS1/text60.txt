Social protection systems have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable. They are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty and inequality at every stage of peoples lives. Benefits for children  mothers with newborns  persons with disability  older persons and those who are poor and without jobs help ensure that no one is left behind. Preliminary data show that in 2016  only 45 per cent of the worlds population were covered by at least one social protection cash benefit  and that the proportion varied widely across countries and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest coverage  with about 13 per cent of its population covered by at least one social protection benefit  versus 86 per cent of the population in Europe and Northern America.
