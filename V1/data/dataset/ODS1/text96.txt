Biological hazards such as COVID-19  along with other disasters such as tropical cyclones and floods  can worsen poverty and slow hunger alleviation. In 2020  based on reporting from 80 countries under the Sendai Framework  the disaster-related mortality rate was 5.74 persons per 100 000 population. This estimation takes into account deaths resulting from disasters of all origins  including COVID-19. At least 80 per cent of disaster-related mortality that year was estimated to be due to the coronavirus. Even without considering significant underreporting (the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates global excess deaths of 4.5 million in 2020)  this figure is already in stark contrast to the 2015-2019 period  when the disaster-related mortality rate averaged 0.93 persons per 100 000 population.
As countries were coping with the economic fallout of the pandemic  33 countries reported $16.5 billion in direct economic losses in 2020  due to other disasters. Of this amount  41 per cent ($6.8 billion) was in the agriculture sector and 38 per cent ($6.2 billion) related to losses resulting from damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure
Meanwhile  significant progress has been made towards increasing the number of countries adopting national disaster risk reduction strategies. By the end of 2021  123 countries reported having such strategies in place  up from just 55 in 2015.
