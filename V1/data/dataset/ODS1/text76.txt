The share of the worlds population living in extreme poverty declined from 15.7 per cent in 2010 to 10.0 per cent in 2015. However  the pace of global poverty reduction has been decelerating. Nowcast estimates put the global poverty rate in 2019 at 8.2 per cent.
Even before COVID-19  baseline projections suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030  missing the target of ending poverty. Assuming the pandemic remains at levels currently expected and that activity recovers later this year  the poverty rate is projected to reach 8.8 per cent in 2020. This is the first rise in global poverty since 1998  and close to the 2017 level. An estimated 71 million additional people will be living in extreme poverty due to COVID-19. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to see the largest increases in extreme poverty  with an additional 32 million and 26 million people  respectively  living below the international poverty line as a result of the pandemic.
