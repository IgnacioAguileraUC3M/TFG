The decline of extreme poverty continues  but the pace has slowed  and the world is not on track to achieving the target of ending poverty by 2030. Extreme poverty today is concentrated and overwhelmingly affects rural populations. Increasingly  it is exacerbated by violent conflicts and climate change. Tackling the remaining pockets of extreme poverty will be challenging due to their persistence and complexityoften involving the interplay of social  political and economic factors. Effective social protection schemes and policies  along with government spending on key services  can help those left behind get back on their feet and find a way out of poverty.
