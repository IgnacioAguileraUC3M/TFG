Having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact  8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018  despite a rapid decline in the working poverty rate over the past 25 years. Substandard working conditions are the main issue  underscoring the central role that decent and productive employment plays in helping people escape poverty. 
Progress in reducing working poverty has slowed over the past five years  suggesting that efforts in this area need to be reinvigorated. The situation remains particularly alarming in sub-Saharan Africa  where the share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018. In least developed and landlocked developing countries  at least one quarter of workers live in extreme poverty despite having a job. Employed young people (between 15 and 24 years of age) are more likely to be living in poverty  with a working poverty rate that is double that of adult workers.
