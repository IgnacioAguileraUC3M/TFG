Biological hazards such as COVID-19  along with other hazards such as hurricanes  floods  earthquakes and wildfires  cause disasters and worsen poverty. Based on the latest reporting under the Sendai Framework monitoring process from 80 countries in 2018  23 458 deaths and 2 164 persons missing were attributed to disasters. Direct economic losses of $23.6 billion were reported by 63 countries  of which 73 per cent ($17.1 billion) were recorded in the agricultural sector and 16 per cent ($3.8 billion) in the housing sector.
Least developed countries (LDCs) were disproportionately affected by disasters in 2018. The 17 LDCs reporting disaster-related losses accounted for 14 per cent of the total population of the 80 countries reporting such losses  but over 29 per cent of the total reported deaths and missing persons attributed to disasters. The economic impacts of disasters were also larger for LDCs  relative to the size of their economies. The 17 LDCs reporting economic losses made up 2 per cent of the GDP of all countries reporting such losses  but suffered 10 per cent of the total direct economic losses.
LDCs share of reported human and economic losses due to disasters  compared with their share of the total population and GDP of countries reporting losses  2018 (percentage)
