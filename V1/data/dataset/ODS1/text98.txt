
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put steady progress in poverty reduction over the past 25 years into reverse  with the number of people in extreme poverty increasing for the first time in a generation. Now  rising inflation and the impacts of the war in Ukraine may derail progress further. The combined crises could lead to an additional 75 million to 95 million people living in extreme poverty in 2022  compared with pre-pandemic projections. While almost all countries have introduced new social protection measures in response to the crisis  many were short-term in nature  and large numbers of vulnerable people have
not yet benefited from them. As things stand  the world is not on track to end poverty by 2030  with poorer countries now needing unprecedented levels of pro-poor growth to achieve this goal.
