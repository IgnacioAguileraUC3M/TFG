Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the immediate and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and preventing people from falling into poverty. However  by 2020  only 46.9 per cent of the global population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit  leaving 4.1 billion people unprotected. In response to the COVID-19 crisis  almost 1 900 social protection measures were announced by 211 countries and territories  although these were mostly (92 per cent) short term in nature. Around 39 per cent of the measures introduced were directed towards vulnerable groups  while 26 per cent related to income security and unemployment protection  showing the high importance of social assistance and unemployment benefits in responding to the crisis. Still  only 96 countries have unemployment protection schemes in place and  even where such schemes exist  effective coverage is often limited  especially in countries with high levels of informal employment. Globally  in 2020  only 43.1 per cent of the labour force were legally covered by unemployment benefit schemes  and only 18.6 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide actually received unemployment benefits. 
Similarly  only 28.9 per cent of people considered vulnerable  all children  along with older people and those of working age not covered by social insurance  had access to social assistance cash benefits in 2020  with coverage varying widely across regions. Sixty-three per cent of those considered vulnerable in high-income countries received cash benefits compared with just 7.8 per cent in low-income countries.
