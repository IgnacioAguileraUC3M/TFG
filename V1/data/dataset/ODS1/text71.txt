No matter the measurewhether loss of life or economic loss disasters cause enormous suffering the world over. From 1998 to 2017  direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion  of which climate-related disasters accounted for 77 per cent of the total (a rise of 151 per cent from 1978 to 1997). Over that period  climate-related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. More than 90 per cent of all disasters were caused by floods  storms  droughts  heatwaves or other extreme weather events.
 Poverty is a major underlying driver of disaster risk  so it comes as no surprise that the poorest countries are experiencing a disproportionate share of damage and loss of life attributed to disasters. More than 90 per cent of internationally reported deaths due to disaster occur in low- and middle-income countries. Disasters kill 130 people for every one million people in low-income countries compared to 18 per one million in high-income countries. Economic losses resulting from disasters are also much higher in poorer countries  when measured as a percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP). Among the 10 worst disasters in terms of economic damage (when expressed relative to GDP)  8 occurred in low- or middle-income countries.
