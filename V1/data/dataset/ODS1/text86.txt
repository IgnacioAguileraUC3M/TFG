Social protection measures are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty across the life cycle. Nevertheless  by 2020  only 46.9 per cent of the global population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit  leaving as many as 4 billion people without a social safety net. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of social protection systems to protect peoples health  jobs and incomes  as well as the consequences of high coverage gaps. As a result  many new social protection measures were introduced in 2020: between 1 February and 31 December  the Governments of 209 countries and territories announced more than 1 600 such measures in response to the crisis  but almost all (94.7 per cent) were short term in nature.
Before the pandemic  most of the population (85.4 per cent) in high-income countries was effectively covered by at least one social protection benefit  compared with just over one tenth (13.4 per cent) in low-income countries.  The coverage gap is even greater for those considered vulnerable  only 7.8 per cent of whom were covered by social assistance in low-income countries.
