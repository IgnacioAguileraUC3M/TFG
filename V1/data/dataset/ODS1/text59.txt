Many of the worlds workers live in extreme poverty due to a lack of decent work opportunities. Almost 10 per cent of the employed population globally lived with their families on less than 1.90 US dollars per person per day in 2016. While the percentage of the working poor has been cut by more than half since 2000when it stood at 28 per centit remains pervasive in a few regions. In sub-Saharan Africa  34 per cent of workers and their families continued to live in extreme poverty in 2016. Working poverty affects youth at a much higher rate than adults: in 2016  15 per cent of young workers worldwide lived under the international poverty line  compared to 9 per cent of adult workers. This pattern holds true across almost all regions.
