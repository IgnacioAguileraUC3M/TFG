The international poverty line is currently defined as 1.90 US dollars per person per day using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP). In the decade from 2002 to 2012  the proportion of the global population living below the poverty line dropped by half  from 26 to 13 per cent. If economic growth rates observed during those 10 years prevail for the next 15  the global rate for extreme poverty will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030  assuming that growth benefits all income groups equally. Poverty remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than 40 per cent of people lived on less than 1.90 US dollars a day in 2012.
