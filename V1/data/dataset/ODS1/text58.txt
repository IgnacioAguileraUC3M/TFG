Nearly a billion people have escaped extreme poverty since 1999; three quarters of a billion remain in its grasp
The international poverty line is currently defined as 1.90 US dollars per person per day using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP). In 2013  an estimated 767 million people lived under the poverty line  down from 1.7 billion people in 1999. This represents a reduction in the global extreme poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2013. The fastest progress was observed in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  where 3 per cent of the population lived in extreme poverty in 2013  down from 35 per cent in 1999.  Despite a decline in the poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa  42 per cent of the population continued to subsist in conditions of extreme poverty in 2013. In fact  sub-Saharan Africa was home to about half of the worlds poor. Combined with Southern Asia  the two regions accounted for over 80 per cent of the worlds poorest people that year.
