Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
In signing Agenda 2030  governments around the world committed to ending poverty in all its manifestations  including its most extreme forms  over the next 15 years. They resolved that all people  everywhere  should enjoy a basic standard of living. This includes social protection benefits for the poor and most vulnerable and ensuring that people harmed by conflict and natural hazards receive adequate support  including access to basic services.
Poverty was halved over a decade  but one in eight people around the world still lived in extreme poverty in 2012
The international poverty line is currently defined as 1.90 US dollars per person per day using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP). In the decade from 2002 to 2012  the proportion of the global population living below the poverty line dropped by half  from 26 to 13 per cent. If economic growth rates observed during those 10 years prevail for the next 15  the global rate for extreme poverty will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030  assuming that growth benefits all income groups equally. Poverty remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than 40 per cent of people lived on less than 1.90 US dollars a day in 2012.

Among the working poor  young people most likely to live in extreme poverty
In 2015  10 per cent of the worlds workers and their families were living on less than 1.90 US dollars per person per day  down from 28 per cent in 2000. Young people aged 15 to 24 are most likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed youth were living below the poverty line in 2015  compared with 9 per cent of working adults. One-third of all workers in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 18 per cent of workers in Southern Asia were among the working poor that year.

About one in five people receive any type of social protection benefit in low-income countries
One way of further reducing poverty is to improve coverage of social protection programmes and target benefits to the poor and most vulnerable. Social protection programmes include social assistance  such as cash transfers  school feeding and targeted food assistance. Social insurance and labour market programmes are other forms of social protection  covering old-age and disability pensions  maternity benefits  unemployment insurance  skills training and wage subsidies  among others. Most poor people remain outside social protection systems  especially in poorer countries: about one in five people receive any type of benefit in low-income countries compared with two in three in upper-middle-income countries.
