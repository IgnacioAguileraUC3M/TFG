
Building the resilience of the poor and strengthening disaster risk reduction are key strategies for ending extreme poverty in the most afflicted countries. Economic losses from natural hazards are now reaching an average of 250 to 300 billion US dollars a year. Based on the estimated future lossas measured by Average Annual Loss (AAL)the largest losses will be concentrated in bigger economies. However  smaller and more vulnerable countries  particularly the small island developing States  bear a disproportionate impact in relation to the size of their economies. More efforts should be made to promote disaster risk reduction  particularly in these most vulnerable countries.
Average Annual Loss in relation to 2013 GDP (percentage)
Note: Average Annual Loss is the expected (i.e.  future) economic loss value normalized in annual
terms considering all potential occurrence (both severity and frequency) of natural hazards (earthquakes  cyclonic wind  storm surges and tsunamis) over a long time frame using probabilistic hazard models.
