The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have reversed much of the progress made in reducing poverty  with global extreme poverty rising in 2020 for the first time since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Even before COVID-19  the world was not on track to achieve the goal of ending poverty by 2030  and without immediate and significant action  it will remain beyond reach. The crisis has demonstrated more clearly than ever the importance of disaster preparedness and robust social protection systems. While the number of countries with disaster risk reduction strategies has increased substantially  and many temporary social protection measures have been put in place in response to the pandemic  increased efforts are needed on both fronts to ensure the most vulnerable are protected.
