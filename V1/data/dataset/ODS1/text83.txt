
 End poverty in all its forms everywhere
The Alimata family live in the Centre region of Burkina Faso. The parents work 103 hours a week to pay for food. Their one-room home has no electricity or toilet  and they spend 3.5 hours a week collecting water. They use charcoal and wood as fuel for their stove.
