In 2020  for the first time in two decades  the share of the worlds workers living in extreme poverty increased  rising from 6.7 per cent in 2019 to 7.2 per cent  pushing an additional 8 million workers into poverty. This reflects lost working hours and reduced incomes for many during the COVID-19 crisis. Although the working poverty rate declined slightly in 2021  to 6.9 per cent  it remains higher than before the pandemic. Most regions have not yet recovered to their 2019 levels. The two regions with the highest working poverty rates  sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)  have also experienced the largest increases in the past two years. The pandemic has likely exacerbated existing disparities in working poverty rates for youth and women  who were already more likely than adults and men to be among the working poor. Youth and women were disproportionately affected by working-hour losses and pay cuts in 2020  meaning these gaps are likely to widen.
