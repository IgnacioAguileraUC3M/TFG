Before the COVID-19 pandemic  the share of the worlds population living in extreme poverty fell from 10.1 per cent in 2015 to 9.3 per cent in 2017. This means that the number of people living on less than $1.90 per day dropped from 741 million to 689 million. However  the rate of reduction had slowed to less than half a percentage point annually between 2015 and 2017  compared with one percentage point annually between 1990 and 2015.
The pandemic has compounded the threats to progress raised by conflict and climate change. Estimates suggest that 2020 saw an increase of between 119 million and 124 million global poor  of whom 60 per cent are in Southern Asia. Nowcasts point to the first rise in the extreme poverty rate since 1998  from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.5 per cent in 2020  undoing the progress made since 2016. The impacts of the pandemic will not be short-lived. Based on current projections  the global poverty rate is expected to be 7 per cent (around 600 million people) in 2030  missing the target of eradicating poverty.
