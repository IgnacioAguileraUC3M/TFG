The share of the worlds workers living in extreme poverty fell by half over the last decade: from 14.3 per cent in 2010 to 7.1 per cent in 2019. However  the pace of progress has slowed since 2013  requiring reinvigorated efforts to reach the 2030 target. Moreover  the impacts of COVID-19 are projected to push millions more into poverty. As of April 2020  recommended or required workplace closures around the world affected 81 per cent of employers and 66 per cent of own-account workers  severely limiting jobs and income.
The gender gap in working poverty had almost been bridged  but evidence is emerging that women are being disproportionally affected by the pandemic. Young workers are exposed to poverty more systematically than adults  a result of inadequate earnings and deficits in job quality. In 2019  12.8 per cent of workers between the ages of 15 and 24 lived in poverty  compared with 6.3 per cent of workers over the age of 24  with the difference between youth and adult working poverty rates decreasing only marginally since 2000. These disparities are likely to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis  which has already led to a sharp increase in unemployment and underemployment  a decline in labour income and job-quality challenges.
