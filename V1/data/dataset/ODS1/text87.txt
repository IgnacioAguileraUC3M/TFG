Disasters and their immediate impacts threaten to reverse development gains and slow poverty reduction and hunger alleviation. Based on the latest reporting under the Sendai Framework monitoring process  direct economic losses of $70.4 billion due to disasters were reported by 53 countries for 2019  of which 60 per cent ($42.5 billion) were recorded in the agricultural sector.
In 2019  over 24 000 deaths were attributed to disasters in 67 countries. This is a substantial reduction from 2018  when disaster mortality peaked at 126 000 (reported by 79 countries)  and is consistent with an overall trend of declining mortality since 2005. However  COVID-19 is already reversing this progress  overwhelming health systems and highlighting underlying socioeconomic vulnerabilities to biological hazards. 
The adoption and implementation of robust multi-hazard disaster risk reduction strategies  which incorporate biological risks such as COVID-19  are critical. As of April 2020  120 countries reported that they had developed and adopted national and/or local disaster risk reduction strategies  up from 48 during the Sendai Frameworks nascent period in 2015.
