The COVID-19 pandemic will have both immediate and long-term economic consequences for people across the globe. Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and preventing many people from falling into poverty. Nevertheless  55 per cent of the worlds population  about 4billion people  did not benefit from any form of social protection in 2016. Only 22 per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment benefits. As of February 2020  only 87 countries had unemployment protection programmes anchored in national legislation  and only 34 of these countries covered the self-employed.
The extent of unemployment benefit coverage varies substantially across regions. Half of unemployed people in Australia and New Zealand receive unemployment payments  and 44 per cent in Europe and Northern America. In contrast  just 3 per cent of the unemployed in sub-Saharan Africa and 12 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean receive such payments.
Differences across regions in coverage of social assistance cash benefits for vulnerable groups  children  people of working age and older persons not protected by contributory schemes  are similarly pronounced. Sixty-one per cent of people in these groups receive cash benefits in Europe and Northern America  compared with 4 per cent in Central and Southern Asia.
