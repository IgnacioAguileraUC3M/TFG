The share of the worlds workers living in extreme poverty fell by more than half from 2010 to 2019  from 14 per cent to 6.6 per cent. However  lockdowns and related public health measures due to COVID-19 have severely affected the informal economy  where the vast majority of the working poor are employed. The related income losses threaten to roll back global progress on reducing working poverty.
Although the gender gap in working poverty globally has narrowed over the years  a substantial gap persists in many parts of the world  particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). There  one third (33.5 per cent) of employed women were living in poverty in 2019  compared with 28.3 per cent of employed men. Worldwide  young workers are twice as likely to be living in poverty as adults  reflecting lower earnings and poorer quality jobs. Since the COVID-19 crisis has had a disproportionate impact on the livelihoods of women and young people  it is likely to exacerbate these longstanding disparities.
