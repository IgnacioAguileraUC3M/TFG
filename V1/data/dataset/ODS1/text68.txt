The share of the worlds population living in extreme poverty decreased to 10 per cent in 2015  from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990. More than one billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty over the past 25 years. Much of this progress was in Eastern Asia  where the poverty rate fell from 52 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2010 to less than 1 per cent in 2015. More recently  Southern Asia has made impressive inroads against extreme poverty  helping to reduce the global rate further. However  the pace of change is decelerating. The nowcast shows the 2018 rate of extreme poverty at 8.6 per cent  and baseline projections suggest that 6 per cent of the worlds population will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030  if current trends continue.
Extreme poverty remains stubbornly high in low-income countries and countries affected by conflict and political upheaval  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the 736 million people who lived on less than $1.90 a day in 2015  413 million were in sub-Saharan Africa. This figure has been climbing in recent years and is higher than the number of poor people in the rest of the world combined. 
Forecasts suggest that without significant shifts in policy  extreme poverty will still be in the double digits in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. About 79 per cent of the worlds poor live in rural areas. The poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per centmore than three times higher than in urban areas (5.3 per cent). Close to half (46 per cent) of extremely poor people are children under 14 years of age.
