 End poverty in all its forms everywhere
The Alimata family live in the Centre region of Burkina Faso. The parents work 103 hours a week to pay for food. Their one-room home has no electricity or toilet  and they spend 3.5 hours a week collecting water. They use charcoal and wood as fuel for their stove.

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have reversed much of the progress made in reducing poverty  with global extreme poverty rising in 2020 for the first time since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Even before COVID-19  the world was not on track to achieve the goal of ending poverty by 2030  and without immediate and significant action  it will remain beyond reach. The crisis has demonstrated more clearly than ever the importance of disaster preparedness and robust social protection systems. While the number of countries with disaster risk reduction strategies has increased substantially  and many temporary social protection measures have been put in place in response to the pandemic  increased efforts are needed on both fronts to ensure the most vulnerable are protected.
COVID-19 has led to the first rise in extreme poverty in a generation
Before the COVID-19 pandemic  the share of the worlds population living in extreme poverty fell from 10.1 per cent in 2015 to 9.3 per cent in 2017. This means that the number of people living on less than $1.90 per day dropped from 741 million to 689 million. However  the rate of reduction had slowed to less than half a percentage point annually between 2015 and 2017  compared with one percentage point annually between 1990 and 2015.
The pandemic has compounded the threats to progress raised by conflict and climate change. Estimates suggest that 2020 saw an increase of between 119 million and 124 million global poor  of whom 60 per cent are in Southern Asia. Nowcasts point to the first rise in the extreme poverty rate since 1998  from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.5 per cent in 2020  undoing the progress made since 2016. The impacts of the pandemic will not be short-lived. Based on current projections  the global poverty rate is expected to be 7 per cent (around 600 million people) in 2030  missing the target of eradicating poverty.

Working poverty disproportionately affects women and youth  and the pandemic is likely to magnify those disparities
The share of the worlds workers living in extreme poverty fell by more than half from 2010 to 2019  from 14 per cent to 6.6 per cent. However  lockdowns and related public health measures due to COVID-19 have severely affected the informal economy  where the vast majority of the working poor are employed. The related income losses threaten to roll back global progress on reducing working poverty.
Although the gender gap in working poverty globally has narrowed over the years  a substantial gap persists in many parts of the world  particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). There  one third (33.5 per cent) of employed women were living in poverty in 2019  compared with 28.3 per cent of employed men. Worldwide  young workers are twice as likely to be living in poverty as adults  reflecting lower earnings and poorer quality jobs. Since the COVID-19 crisis has had a disproportionate impact on the livelihoods of women and young people  it is likely to exacerbate these longstanding disparities.

Governments have put new social protection measures in place  but most are only temporary
Social protection measures are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty across the life cycle. Nevertheless  by 2020  only 46.9 per cent of the global population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit  leaving as many as 4 billion people without a social safety net. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of social protection systems to protect peoples health  jobs and incomes  as well as the consequences of high coverage gaps. As a result  many new social protection measures were introduced in 2020: between 1 February and 31 December  the Governments of 209 countries and territories announced more than 1 600 such measures in response to the crisis  but almost all (94.7 per cent) were short term in nature.
Before the pandemic  most of the population (85.4 per cent) in high-income countries was effectively covered by at least one social protection benefit  compared with just over one tenth (13.4 per cent) in low-income countries.  The coverage gap is even greater for those considered vulnerable  only 7.8 per cent of whom were covered by social assistance in low-income countries.

Good results from a global initiative to reduce disaster risk could be undermined by the pandemic 
Disasters and their immediate impacts threaten to reverse development gains and slow poverty reduction and hunger alleviation. Based on the latest reporting under the Sendai Framework monitoring process  direct economic losses of $70.4 billion due to disasters were reported by 53 countries for 2019  of which 60 per cent ($42.5 billion) were recorded in the agricultural sector.
In 2019  over 24 000 deaths were attributed to disasters in 67 countries. This is a substantial reduction from 2018  when disaster mortality peaked at 126 000 (reported by 79 countries)  and is consistent with an overall trend of declining mortality since 2005. However  COVID-19 is already reversing this progress  overwhelming health systems and highlighting underlying socioeconomic vulnerabilities to biological hazards. 
The adoption and implementation of robust multi-hazard disaster risk reduction strategies  which incorporate biological risks such as COVID-19  are critical. As of April 2020  120 countries reported that they had developed and adopted national and/or local disaster risk reduction strategies  up from 48 during the Sendai Frameworks nascent period in 2015.
