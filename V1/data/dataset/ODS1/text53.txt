One way of further reducing poverty is to improve coverage of social protection programmes and target benefits to the poor and most vulnerable. Social protection programmes include social assistance  such as cash transfers  school feeding and targeted food assistance. Social insurance and labour market programmes are other forms of social protection  covering old-age and disability pensions  maternity benefits  unemployment insurance  skills training and wage subsidies  among others. Most poor people remain outside social protection systems  especially in poorer countries: about one in five people receive any type of benefit in low-income countries compared with two in three in upper-middle-income countries.
