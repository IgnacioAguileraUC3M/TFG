 Binding laws and policies giving individuals the right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries  with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013. Expert assessments  however  suggest that in many cases  the legal framework could be improved. Among the 123 countries for which data on legal frameworks are available  40 countries do not have adequate provisions on the right to appeal to an independent administrative body  which is considered key for the proper implementation of this right. 
 The pace of progress in establishing national human rights institutions (NHRIs) that are in compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions (the Paris Principles) must be accelerated. In 2018  only 39 per cent of all countries had successfully achieved compliance; an increase of 3 per cent (7 countries) from 2015. If growth continues at the same rate  by 2030 only around half of all countries will have compliant NHRIs to ensure that States deliver on their human rights obligations.
