While some regions have reached universal or near-universal birth registration  globally the average is just 71 per cent  based on available data reported for 147 countries from 2010 to 2016 and covering 80 per cent of the worlds population of children under age 5. Less than half (46 per cent) of all children under age 5 in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered  while in Central and Southern Asia  and Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand  the births of fewer than two in three children have been registered.
