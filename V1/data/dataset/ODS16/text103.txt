 The global homicide rate was roughly stable at around 6 per 100 000 people over the 20072017 decade  with the highest rates observed in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of homicide victims increased by 11 per cent  from 419 000 in 2000 to 464 000 in 2017. Over that period  lethal violence was increasingly concentrated in two regions: Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for 34 per cent of global homicides in 2017 (compared to 27 per cent in 2000)  and the share in sub-Saharan Africa grew from 25 to 33 per cent. 
 Men made up around 80 per cent of homicide victims overall  but women constituted the majority (64 per cent) of murder victims in cases of intimate partner/family-related homicide. For intimate partner homicides only  the share of female victims was even higher at 82 per cent. Young men 15 to 29 years old faced the highest homicide risk overall with some regional variations.
