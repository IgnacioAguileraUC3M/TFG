Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development  provide access to justice for all and build effective  accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Progress in promoting peace and justice  and in building effective  accountable and inclusive institutions remains uneven across and within regions. Homicides are slowly declining  and more citizens around the world have better access to justice. However  violent conflicts have increased in recent years  and a number of high-intensity armed conflicts are causing large numbers of civilian casualties and driving millions of people from their homes. Disparities abound: data show that countries with higher income inequality suffer from higher levels of violence. Poorer countries and regions tend to be sources of victims for human traffickers and are more prone to corruption. In response  legal frameworks and institutions are being put in place for example  on access to information and human rights promotionbut implementation does not always follow suit.

A decline in homicide rates over the past decade hides wide disparities among countries and regions

      In 2015  between 5.2 and 6.7 persons per 100 000 people worldwide were victims of intentional homicide. While intentional homicides saw an overall decline over the past decade  people in some countries in Latin America  sub-Saharan Africa and Asia face a heightened risk of becoming a victim. The incidence of intentional homicide continues to vary markedly across regions. Latin American and the Caribbean had the highest rate by far17 times that of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and 20 times the rate in Australia and New Zealand.  The majority of homicide victims are male. In recent years  four to five times as many males as females were murdered annually.

Homicide rates are higher in countries with high income inequality

      Countries with higher levels of income inequality tend to have higher rates of intentional homicidea phenomenon that cuts across countries and regions. Since 2005  homicide rates have actually increased in a number of countries with high levels of income inequality  even while overall trends continued downward. Moreover  in 2015  these countries had  on average  a homicide rate that was nine times greater than countries where income was more evenly distributed.

Violent forms of child discipline are pervasive

    Violent forms of discipline  including methods that rely on physical punishment  verbal intimidation and psychological aggression  are pervasive. Different forms of violent discipline tend to overlap and frequently occur together  exacerbating the short- and long-term harm they inflict. Such harm ranges from immediate effects to long-term damage that children carry well into adulthood. Despite their detrimental and long-lasting impact  violent forms of discipline are widespread. In 76 countries with available data from 2005 to 2016  on average  about 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis. In all but seven of these countries  more than half of children experienced some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home.

No region is immune from human trafficking

    More than 570 different trafficking flows  which criss-cross the globe  were identified by law enforcement officers between 2012 and 2014. While trafficking affects all regions  many transnational flows involve the movement of victims from lowerto higher-income countries. Globally  more women and girls than men and boys were identified as victims of trafficking in 2014. However  the share of women and girls slowly declined  from 84 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent in 2014. And while the share of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation has also fallen  the proportion of those trafficked for forced labour has increased. More than a quarter of all trafficking victims detected in 2014 were children  with girls outnumbering boys (20 per cent of total victims versus 8 per cent). In sub-Saharan Africa and Central America and the Caribbean  the majority of detected victims were children.

One third of the worlds prisoners are being held without sentencing

      Rates of pretrial detention suggest that progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice has been slow. Globally  the proportion of people held in detention without being tried or sentenced for a crime has remained almost unchangedfrom 32 per cent of total prisoners in 2003-2005 to 31 per cent in 2013-2015. This indicates that no significant progress has been made in the ability of judicial systems to process and try the accused in an efficient manner. Northern Africa and Western Asia  which had one of the highest proportions of unsentenced detainees a decade ago  has made the most progress. In contrast  the highest proportion of unsentenced detainees remains in Central and Southern Asia  where over 60 per cent of the total prison population are being detained without a trial.

Firms in low-income countries are confronted by more bribery requests than those in richer countries

      Opaque  burdensome and inefficient regulations and procedures
      provide a cover in which corrupt officials are able to extract bribes
      or unofficial payments. According to data from 2005 to 2016  over
      18 per cent of firms worldwide reported receiving at least one bribery
      payment request. The share of firms in low- and lower-middle-income
      countries was 25 per cent  versus 4 per cent in high-income countries.
      Bribery often occurs in transactions necessary for a private firm
      to conduct business  such as paying taxes; obtaining an operating
      license  import license or construction permit; or obtaining an
      electrical or water connection. The data show that  across all regions 
      bribery is common when seeking to secure a government contract 
      with almost 30 per cent of firms reporting that they are expected to
      do so. In the worst-affected region  nearly one half of firms encounter
      bribery requests when engaging in public procurement.

More than forty per cent of countries assessed improved the reliability of their national budgets

      To provide a sound basis for development  government budgets should be comprehensive  transparent and realistic. Since 2005  147 countries had carried out at least one assessment on government budget execution  with 103 of them having carried out multiple assessments. The results show that expenditures in nearly 2 out of 3 countries that completed at least one assessment were within 10 per cent of their original national budget estimates  and more than one third of the countries were within 5 per cent of their budgets. For the 103 countries that completed multiple assessments  budget reliability has improved over time in some regions  with about 80 per cent of countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia showing improvement. Implementing realistic budgets is particularly challenging in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than three quarters of countries were more than 5 per cent off  and about 40 per cent of countries experienced a deterioration in the reliability of their budget execution estimates.

Birth registration is still limited in some regions

      Birth registration is a first step towards safeguarding individual rights and providing every person with access to justice and social services. While some regions have reached universal or near-universal birth registration  globally the average is just 71 per cent  based on available data reported for 147 countries from 2010 to 2016 and covering 80 per cent of the worlds population of children under age 5. Less than half (46 per cent) of all children under age 5 in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered  while in Central and Southern Asia  and Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand  the births of fewer than two in three children have been registered.

Of the 102 journalists killed in 2016  nearly a third were in the Arab States

      In 2016  102 journalists lost their lives while attempting to do their jobs. This is a decrease from 2015  when 115 journalists were killed  but an increase from 2014 and 2013  when 98 and 90 journalists  respectively  lost their lives. The highest number of deaths (32) in 2016 occurred in the Arab States region  home to several armed conflicts. Earlier reports suggest that fewer than 1 in 10 cases of journalists killed between 2006 and 2015 led to a conviction; statistics are not yet available for the 2016 cases.

More countries have adopted freedom-of-information legislation  but implementation lags behind

      Freedom-of-information laws and policies have been adopted by 111 countries  with at least 15 countries adopting such laws over the past four years. Expert assessments  however  suggest that implementation remains a challenge. Among the 109 countries with implementation data  only 62 countries had clear legal provisions for exceptions to the right of access to information in 2016. Similarly  only 62 countries had sufficient provisions for promotional materials  including those relating to effective public awareness-raising. This means that in around 40 per cent of countries with freedom-of-information laws in place  the public may not be aware of their existence.

More work is needed to ensure that human rights institutions are compliant with international standards

      Independent national human rights institutions (NHRIs) encourage States to deliver on their human rights obligations  protect people from violence  and ensure that no one is left behind. By the end of 2016  57 per cent of countries had an NHRI that had been reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles) by their peers and 37 per cent of countries were found to be compliant. Compliance was highest in Australia and New Zealand at 100 per cent. Compliance was higher than the global average in Europe and Northern America at 46 per cent. The values for all regions represent a significant global increase since 2000  when only 21 per cent of countries had been reviewed for compliance  and 16 per cent had an NHRI that was compliant. However  the low rates of compliance in some regions highlight the need for further capacity-building and international cooperation.
