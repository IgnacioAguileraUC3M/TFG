Different forms of violent discipline tend to overlap and frequently occur together  exacerbating the short- and long-term harm they inflict. Such harm ranges from immediate effects to long-term damage that children carry well into adulthood. Despite their detrimental and long-lasting impact  violent forms of discipline are widespread. In 76 countries with available data from 2005 to 2016  on average  about 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis. In all but seven of these countries  more than half of children experienced some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home.
