 Across all regions  people defending the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others are the targets of violent attacks. From 2015 to 2019  the United Nations recorded at least 1 940 killings and 106 enforced disappearances of human rights defenders  journalists and trade unionists across 81 countries  with over half of killings occurring in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2019  357 killings and 30 enforced disappearances were reported in 47 countries. While the 2019 toll constitutes the lowest number of killings of journalists per year in over a decade  journalists are increasingly experiencing verbal and physical attacks  including online  in connection with their work. Women journalists in particular are targeted by online harassment. This is underscored by a marked rise in widespread hostile rhetoric directed at the media and journalists. 

          More countries now have freedom-of-information laws  but their implementation could be stepped up
      
The right to information held by public authorities is an integral aspect of freedom of expression and serves as a mechanism to support government openness and accountability as well as enhanced empowerment and equality among all social groups. Progress is being made in ensuring this right through policies and binding laws. Such laws have now been adopted by 127 countries  with at least 27 adopting guarantees since 2014. However  of 73 public authorities surveyed  only 58 per cent provided specialized training on the right to information for their information officers. The same percentage reported publishing guidelines for requests for the public. Survey results indicate that oversight and appeals bodies (as opposed to multi-purpose bodies) should be essential components of access-to-information law enforcement and specialized entities.
