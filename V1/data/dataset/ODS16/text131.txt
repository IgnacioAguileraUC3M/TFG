Between 2015 and 2020  the global homicide rate declined by 5.2 per cent - from 5.9 to 5.6 homicides per 100 000 people. Globally  8 out of 10 recorded homicide victims are male  although women and girls comprise about 60 per cent of all homicide victims killed by intimate partners or family members. Gender disparities are also found at the regional level. In Latin America and the Caribbean  the homicide rate declined by 6.9 per cent for males but increased by 2.7 per cent for females between 2015 and 2020. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  the homicide rate declined by 35 per cent for males but by 20 per cent for females. 
By 2030  it is projected that the global homicide rate will decrease by 19 per cent from the 2015 level  to around 4.8 per 100 000 people. This falls short of the  significant reduction  by 2030 targeted in the Sustainable Development Goals. Accelerated progress will require additional policy interventions aimed at curbing lethal violence in the public arena  along with specific policies aimed at preventing gender-based killings within the home.
