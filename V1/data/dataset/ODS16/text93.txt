Since 2005  147 countries had carried out at least one assessment on government budget execution  with 103 of them having carried out multiple assessments. The results show that expenditures in nearly 2 out of 3 countries that completed at least one assessment were within 10 per cent of their original national budget estimates  and more than one third of the countries were within 5 per cent of their budgets. For the 103 countries that completed multiple assessments  budget reliability has improved over time in some regions  with about 80 per cent of countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia showing improvement. Implementing realistic budgets is particularly challenging in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than three quarters of countries were more than 5 per cent off  and about 40 per cent of countries experienced a deterioration in the reliability of their budget execution estimates.
