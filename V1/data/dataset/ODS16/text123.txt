Since 2015  the killings of human rights defenders  journalists and trade unionists have been reported in over one third of Member States. These deaths have persisted despite the pandemic. In 2020  the killings of 331 human rights defenders were reported in 32 countries (an 18 per cent increase from 2019)  along with 19 enforced disappearances in 14 countries. Women comprised 13 per cent of the victims and Latin America remains the region most affected. In 2020  62 journalists were also killed  the lowest annual death toll in the past decade. Impunity is a key driver in these killings; in some contexts  pandemic measures have been used to avoid accountability. Mustering the political will to prosecute perpetrators is key to preventing more deaths. In addition  Member States should publicly applaud the vital contributions of these courageous individuals towards building more just societies based on the rule of law.
