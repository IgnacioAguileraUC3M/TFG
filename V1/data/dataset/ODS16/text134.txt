 Pleas for global peace are growing louder as the world witnesses the largest number of violent conflicts since 1946  with one quarter of the global population living in conflict-affected countries at the end of 2020. Amid these crises  and despite movement restrictions prompted by COVID-19  forced displacement has continued and even grown. As of May 2022  a record 100 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide. This staggering number will increase along with the widening repercussions of the war in Ukraine. The cost of war and conflict is high  affecting the poor and vulnerable the most and leading to global impacts and escalating human rights violations and humanitarian needs. Exercising fundamental freedoms in the defence of others remains deadly  with 320 fatal attacks against human rights defenders  journalists and trade unionists recorded in 35 countries in 2021. Ending armed conflicts  strengthening institutions and enacting inclusive and equitable legislation that protects the human rights of all persons are necessary preconditions for sustainable development.
