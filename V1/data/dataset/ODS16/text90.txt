While trafficking affects all regions  many transnational flows involve the movement of victims from lowerto higher-income countries. Globally  more women and girls than men and boys were identified as victims of trafficking in 2014. However  the share of women and girls slowly declined  from 84 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent in 2014. And while the share of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation has also fallen  the proportion of those trafficked for forced labour has increased. More than a quarter of all trafficking victims detected in 2014 were children  with girls outnumbering boys (20 per cent of total victims versus 8 per cent). In sub-Saharan Africa and Central America and the Caribbean  the majority of detected victims were children.
