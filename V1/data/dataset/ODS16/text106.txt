Every week  an average of nine people were murdered on the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and equal societiesa disturbing increase from the average of one victim per day from 2015 to 2017. 
 One in two victims had been working with communities on issues involving land  the environment  poverty  the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples  or the impact of business activities. And  overall  every tenth victim was a woman. Journalists and bloggers constituted one quarter of the total number of victims killed  and most of these murders occurred outside of countries experiencing conflict.
