Globally  the proportion of people held in detention without being tried or sentenced for a crime has remained almost unchangedfrom 32 per cent of total prisoners in 2003-2005 to 31 per cent in 2013-2015. This indicates that no significant progress has been made in the ability of judicial systems to process and try the accused in an efficient manner. Northern Africa and Western Asia  which had one of the highest proportions of unsentenced detainees a decade ago  has made the most progress. In contrast  the highest proportion of unsentenced detainees remains in Central and Southern Asia  where over 60 per cent of the total prison population are being detained without a trial.
