However  the births of more than one in four children under age 5 worldwide go unrecorded. In sub-Saharan Africa  the share is over half (54 per cent). In the LDCs  one in two children have not been registered by their fifth birthdays. Globally  children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. And in most regions  birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population.

Note:  Estimates are based on a subset of 144 countries covering 92 per cent of the global population of children under age 5. Data coverage was insufficient to calculate regional estimates for Eastern Asia  Oceania  and the Caucasus and Central Asia.
