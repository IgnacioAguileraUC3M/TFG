Access to justice for all should ensure a fair trial within a reasonably short period of time. However  31 per cent of prisoners worldwide are being held in detention without being sentenced for a crime  a level that has not declined since 2005. Significant increases over the past three years were recorded in all regions of Asia and in Oceania.
Prison overcrowding remains a serious problem in many countries  often leading to inhumane conditions  the violation of human rights  violence among prisoners and reduced prospects for rehabilitation. Overcrowding is accelerating the spread of COVID-19 across jails and prisons worldwide due to cramped quarters  and the frequent lack of protective gear and access to adequate health care. Out of 190 countries worldwide with available data  almost 60 per cent had prison populations exceeding prison capacity; 13 per cent of countries had between 120 per cent and 149 per cent of capacity  and 28 per cent had 150 per cent of capacity or more.
