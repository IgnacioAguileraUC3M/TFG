The number of reporting countries remained roughly the same (93 in 2010 compared to 97 in 2016). The increase in the average number of detected victims per country may be a sign of stepped-up efforts by authorities to identify victims; alternatively  it could reflect a growing trafficking problem. Contrary to findings from earlier years  most trafficking victims are now detected domestically.
    

      In 2016  adult women comprised nearly half of the detected victims globally  and girls accounted for about 23 per cent. The majority of victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation (about 59 per cent)  and more than a third were trafficked for forced labour. Victim profiles were different depending on the form of exploitation. While 83 per cent of the female victims in 2016 were trafficked for sexual exploitation  82 per cent of the males were trafficked for forced labour.
