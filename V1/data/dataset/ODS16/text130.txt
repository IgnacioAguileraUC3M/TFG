 Feeling unsafe in public can fundamentally erode one's sense of well-being and reduce trust and community engagement  becoming an obstacle to development. On average  about 69 per cent of the world's population report feeling safe walking alone at night in the area in which they live  a proportion that has remained stable from 2016 to 2021. However  stark differences are found among regions  with Latin America and the Caribbean reporting the lowest level of perceived public safety and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia reporting the highest. The proportion of women feeling safe walking alone in their local neighbourhoods at night is  on average  10 percentage points lower than that of men (61 per cent versus 71 per cent)  according to 20192021 data from 106 countries. This gender gap holds across all regions but is particularly pronounced in Australia and New Zealand (a 27-percentage-point difference) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (a 17-percentage-point difference).
