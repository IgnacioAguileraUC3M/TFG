 Realizing the goal of peaceful  just and inclusive societies is still a long way off. In recent years  no substantial advances have been made towards ending violence  promoting the rule of law  strengthening institutions at all levels  or increasing access to justice. Millions of people have been deprived of their security  rights and opportunities  while attacks on human rights activists and journalists are holding back development. More countries are ramping up efforts to uncover human rights abuses and designing laws and regulations that foster more open and just societies. But much more work is needed to ensure that these mechanisms are implemented properly. Conflict and other forms of violence are an affront to sustainable development. In 2018  the number of people fleeing war  persecution and conflict exceeded 70 million  the highest level that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has seen in almost 70 years. All are particularly vulnerable to various forms of abuse  including trafficking  violence and non-inclusive decision-making. Ensuring that they receive adequate protection is paramount to achieving the goal of inclusive societies and sustainable development.
