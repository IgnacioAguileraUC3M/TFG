Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development  provide access to justice for all and build effective  accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels

  Central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the need to promote peaceful and inclusive societies based on respect for human rights  the rule of law and transparent  effective and accountable institutions. A number of regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still face protracted violence and armed conflict  and far too many people are poorly supported by weak institutions and lack access to justice  information and other fundamental freedoms. Efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective  inclusive and transparent. Today  more than half the world has internationally recognized human rights institutions. However  significant challenges remain  including lack of data on various forms of violence against children and other vulnerable groups  access to justice and public access to information.
  

Intentional homicide rates vary widely across regions

      Worldwide  the number of victims of intentional homicide per 100 000 people was estimated at between 4.6 and 6.8 in 2014. However  the homicide rate in developing regions was twice that of developed regions and  in Latin America and the Caribbean  it was four times the world average.

Children  a majority of them girls  represent almost 30 per cent of victims of human trafficking worldwide

      Various forms of violence against children persist  including human trafficking and sexual violence. Globally  the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking peaked in 2011  at 21 per cent and 13 per cent  respectively  of cases detected by authorities that year.  Girls who are victims of human trafficking are often subjected to sexual exploitation  forced marriage and/or domestic servitude. Underreporting and lack of comparable data remain stubborn obstacles to understanding the full extent of sexual violence against children. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged 18 to 29 years who experienced sexual violence for the first time before age 18 may be as high as 16 per cent.

Thirty per cent of prisoners worldwide  two-thirds of them in developing countries  are being held without being sentenced

    Worldwide  the proportion of people held in detention without being sentenced for a crime decreased only slightly over the last decadefrom 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-2014. The figure for developing regions has on average been higher than that for developed regions. The highest rate of unsentenced detainees was in Southern Asia  where  despite recent progress  about two out of three prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014. In Latin America and the Caribbean  the region with the second highest percentage  the share of persons held in detention without being sentenced remained practically unchanged over the last decade  at 43 per cent.

Birth registration is the first step in securing recognition before the law  yet one in four children are denied this fundamental right

    Registering children at birth is the first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice and social services. However  the births of more than one in four children under age 5 worldwide go unrecorded. In sub-Saharan Africa  the share is over half (54 per cent). In the LDCs  one in two children have not been registered by their fifth birthdays. Globally  children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. And in most regions  birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population.
    
Estimated proportion of children under 5 whose births were registered  2010-2015 (percentage)
Note:  Estimates are based on a subset of 144 countries covering 92 per cent of the global population of children under age 5. Data coverage was insufficient to calculate regional estimates for Eastern Asia  Oceania  and the Caucasus and Central Asia.
