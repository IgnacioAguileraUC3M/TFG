Progress in promoting peace and justice  and in building effective  accountable and inclusive institutions remains uneven across and within regions. Homicides are slowly declining  and more citizens around the world have better access to justice. However  violent conflicts have increased in recent years  and a number of high-intensity armed conflicts are causing large numbers of civilian casualties and driving millions of people from their homes. Disparities abound: data show that countries with higher income inequality suffer from higher levels of violence. Poorer countries and regions tend to be sources of victims for human traffickers and are more prone to corruption. In response  legal frameworks and institutions are being put in place for example  on access to information and human rights promotionbut implementation does not always follow suit.
