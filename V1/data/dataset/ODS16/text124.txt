 National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are independent bodies that promote and protect human rights. They have played a critical role during the pandemic by examining and monitoring impacts on health and other areas and by highlighting the human rights implications of the crisis. They have also combated the spread of inaccurate and misleading information and worked to protect vulnerable groups. In 2020  82 countries had independent NHRIs that successfully achieved compliance with international standards  a 17 per cent improvement from 2015. One in three LDCs now have an internationally compliant NHRI  compared with one in five in 2015. These gains  however  are not enough to meet the 2030 target. Progress has stalled in most regions  where no new independent NHRIs have been recognized or established since 2018. Efforts will need to be redoubled to establish and strengthen NHRIs and ensure broader access to human rights promotion and protection services.
