 Under international law  civilians are to be protected in armed conflicts. Yet  at least 106 806 civilian deaths were recorded by the United Nations in 12 of the worlds deadliest armed conflicts between 2015 and 2017. This translates to an average of 11.9 civilian deaths per 100 000 population each year; one in eight of those deaths was a woman or child. Most of the civilian deaths were caused by heavy weapons and explosive munitions  followed by planted explosives and unexploded ordnance. More than 20 000 civilians were killed or injured in 10 conflicts in 2019  which is only a fraction of the actual total. 
The threat of COVID-19 is greater in situations of armed conflict  where fighting has ravaged health systems  displaced people and forced them to live in overcrowded conditions with marginal or no access to basic services. The terrible suffering of civilians could be significantly reduced if parties to conflict respected international humanitarian and human rights laws. More must be done to prevent  reduce and resolve ongoing conflicts.
