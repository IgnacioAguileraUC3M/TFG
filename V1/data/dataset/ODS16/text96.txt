Expert assessments  however  suggest that implementation remains a challenge. Among the 109 countries with implementation data  only 62 countries had clear legal provisions for exceptions to the right of access to information in 2016. Similarly  only 62 countries had sufficient provisions for promotional materials  including those relating to effective public awareness-raising. This means that in around 40 per cent of countries with freedom-of-information laws in place  the public may not be aware of their existence.
