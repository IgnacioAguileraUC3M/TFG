Globally  the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking peaked in 2011  at 21 per cent and 13 per cent  respectively  of cases detected by authorities that year.  Girls who are victims of human trafficking are often subjected to sexual exploitation  forced marriage and/or domestic servitude. Underreporting and lack of comparable data remain stubborn obstacles to understanding the full extent of sexual violence against children. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged 18 to 29 years who experienced sexual violence for the first time before age 18 may be as high as 16 per cent.
