      provide a cover in which corrupt officials are able to extract bribes
      or unofficial payments. According to data from 2005 to 2016  over
      18 per cent of firms worldwide reported receiving at least one bribery
      payment request. The share of firms in low- and lower-middle-income
      countries was 25 per cent  versus 4 per cent in high-income countries.
      Bribery often occurs in transactions necessary for a private firm
      to conduct business  such as paying taxes; obtaining an operating
      license  import license or construction permit; or obtaining an
      electrical or water connection. The data show that  across all regions 
      bribery is common when seeking to secure a government contract 
      with almost 30 per cent of firms reporting that they are expected to
      do so. In the worst-affected region  nearly one half of firms encounter
      bribery requests when engaging in public procurement.
