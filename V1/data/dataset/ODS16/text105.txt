Yet  less than three quarters (73 per cent) of children under 5 years of age worldwide have had their births registered  according to data from 161 countries over the period 2010 to 2018. Many countries and regions have reached universal or near universal coverage  but in sub-Saharan Africa  fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under 5 years of age are registered. Central and Southern Asia and South-Eastern Asia also lag behind at 68 per cent and 82 per cent  respectively. Much work has been done recently to improve civil registration systems and to raise awareness among citizens  but continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children can claim their right to an identity.
