 The world is still a long way from achieving the goal of peaceful  just and inclusive societies. Hundreds of millions of people are living in fragile and conflict-affected States. At the end of 2020  about 1 per cent of the global population  82.4 million people  had been forcibly displaced as a result of persecution  conflict or generalized violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and intensified inequality and discrimination. In fact  the crisis has created major disruptions in government functioning and has tested  weakened and sometimes even shattered countries systems of rights and protection. The pandemic is disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable worldwide  with children at high risk. Recovery from the crisis and sustainable development must be built on a foundation of peace  stability  respect for human rights  effective governance and the rule of law.
