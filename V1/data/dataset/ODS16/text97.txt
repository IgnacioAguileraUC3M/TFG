By the end of 2016  57 per cent of countries had an NHRI that had been reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles) by their peers and 37 per cent of countries were found to be compliant. Compliance was highest in Australia and New Zealand at 100 per cent. Compliance was higher than the global average in Europe and Northern America at 46 per cent. The values for all regions represent a significant global increase since 2000  when only 21 per cent of countries had been reviewed for compliance  and 16 per cent had an NHRI that was compliant. However  the low rates of compliance in some regions highlight the need for further capacity-building and international cooperation.
