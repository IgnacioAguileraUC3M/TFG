This translates to approximately 440 000 homicide victims worldwide (81 per cent male and 19 per cent female) each year. Two thirds of homicide victims live in sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (33 per cent). To significantly reduce all forms of violence  stronger efforts are needed to cut the global homicide rate. If 20152018 trends continue  the rate per 100 000 population would stand at around 5.2 in 2030  an overall decrease of about 12 per cent.
    

      Policies adopted by Governments subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic have had different impacts on homicide prevalence in various countries. Trends suggest that lockdown measures have hardly affected violence in Latin American countries with high levels of homicides  but the intense lockdown measures in European countries with low levels of homicide seem to have drastically reduced violence.
