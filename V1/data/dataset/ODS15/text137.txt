
Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food  water  medicine  shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services  the cleaning of air and water  for example  which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures. Nevertheless  human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40 000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades  10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year  and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.

  In an effort to prevent and halt the degradation of such ecosystems  many countries are sustainably managing their forests  protecting sites critical to biodiversity  and enacting national conservation legislation and policies. However  other opportunities are being lost. The emergence of COVID-19 was an opportunity to integrate biodiversity considerations into economic recovery measures and build a more viable future. But biodiversity has been largely neglected in recovery spending.
