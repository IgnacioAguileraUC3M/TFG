A growing number of forest areas are being sustainably managed  integrating policies and practices that protect forest ecosystems and address drivers of degradation. All regions continue to make progress on conferring official protection status to areas critical to global biodiversity. However  land degradation is increasing due to competing pressures for food  energy and shelter. Biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate. In addition  invasive species  the illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife  and falling trends in ODA in support of biodiversity continue to thwart efforts to protect and restore vital ecosystems and species. Accelerated action is urgently needed to preserve and promote the sustainable use of ecosystems on which all life depends.
