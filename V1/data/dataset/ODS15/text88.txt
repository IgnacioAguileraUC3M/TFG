Protected and restored ecosystems and the biodiversity they support can help mitigate climate change and provide increased resilience in the face of increased human pressures and mounting disasters. Healthy ecosystems also produce multiple benefits for all communities: clean air  water  food  raw materials and medicines  to name a few. To date  progress in preserving and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems and protecting biodiversity has been uneven. The pace of forest loss has slowed  and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and safeguarding areas important for biodiversity. That said  accelerating biodiversity loss  along with continued poaching and trafficking of wildlife  is alarming. Moreover  from 1998 to 2013  about one fifth of the Earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistently declining trends in productivity. Soil and land degradation undermines the security and development of all countries.
