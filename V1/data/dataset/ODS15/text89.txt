These areas can play a critical role in achieving sustainable development if they are effectively managed and strategically located. Protecting key biodiversity areas (KBAs)sites that contribute significantly to global biodiversityis necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. To date  more than 15 000 KBAs have been identified worldwide.
    

      Protecting key sites important for terrestrial  freshwater and mountain biodiversity is vital for ensuring long-term and sustainable use of these various natural resources. Globally  between 2000 and 2017  average coverage of terrestrial  freshwater and mountain KBAs by protected areas increased from 35 to 47 per cent  from 32 to 43 per cent  and from 39 to 49 per cent  respectively. While this upward trend is encouraging  recent growth in KBAs covered by protected areas has been modest  with an increase of only 1 to 2 percentage points since 2010.
