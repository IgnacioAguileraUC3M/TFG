From 2010 to 2015  the annual net loss of forest area worldwide was less than half that of the 1990s. More forests are being protected  and areas under long-term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. The proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. Most forest loss can be attributed to deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean.
