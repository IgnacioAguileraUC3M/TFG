Illicitly trafficked species are normally found far from their original source after having been transported through multiple countries. Iconic species  such as tigers  elephants and rhinos  along with many lesser-known animals  plants and marine life  face intense pressures for survival. Poached and trafficked wildlife are found in many distinct and often-unrelated markets. They are used in a range of industries  from furniture to fashion  each subject to unique dynamics and volatile trafficking patterns. Demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly  before the international community can effectively respond. In 2013  elephant ivory  rosewood  rhinoceros horn and reptiles comprised 70 per cent of total wildlife seizures. Addressing these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of markets that make use of wild-sourced materials and products  along with greater regulation of these sectors.

          Note: Other wildlife include corals  sturgeons  marine turtles  parrots  big cats  tortoises  raptors and others. To combine seizures of disparate wildlife products  some common unit is required  and measures such as quantity and weight will not suffice. The  standard value  used here is based on declared import values for similar legal products in a reference market and is intended to give a sense of relative value  not an absolute monetary valuation.
