The proportion of KBAs covered by protected areas continues to increase in freshwater  terrestrial and mountain ecosystems. On average  for all three types of ecosystems  the proportion of KBAs covered by protected areas increased by more than 10 percentage points from 2000 to 2018. Europe and Northern America has the highest average coverage of protected freshwater  terrestrial and mountain KBAs (at 55 per cent  63 per cent and 68 per cent  respectively). This region also has the highest annual average growth rates for terrestrial and freshwater KBAs that are protected. Oceania has the fastest annual average growth rate for mountain KBAs covered by protected areas (at 1 per cent annually) and has seen the largest overall increase since 2000 (19 per cent). The protection of KBAs safeguards critical natural capital and ecosystem functions that support human well-being and enhance the resiliency of communities.
