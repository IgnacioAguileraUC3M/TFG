 Human activity continues to erode the health of ecosystems on which all species depend. The loss of forests is slowing but continues at an alarming rate; one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction according to a recent United Nations report  and an estimated 20 per cent of the Earths land area was degraded between 2000 and 2015. Many countries are taking measures to conserve  restore and make sustainable use of those invaluable natural resources. They are adopting legal mechanisms to ensure the fair sharing of benefits from genetic resources  protecting more KBAs  and implementing sustainable forest management plans. But those efforts must be scaled upurgently. The severity of the situation requires immediate action and a fundamental transformation of our relationship with the Earth to halt biodiversity loss and protect ecosystems for the benefit of all.
