
 Seventy-five per cent of emerging infectious diseases  such as bird flu and Ebola  are zoonotic  they are transmitted from wildlife to people. Transmission occurs through human contact with affected wild animals and tends to happen when populations encroach on natural habitats and engage in activities that disrupt ecosystems  such as wildlife trafficking. 
 Pangolins  scaly anteaters found in Africa and Asia  are the most heavily trafficked wild mammal on Earth. They are among the leading suspects in intermediary animals that transferred the coronavirus from wild bats to people. Pangolin meat is sold in wet markets  which have been identified as possible sites where the coronavirus jumped to humans.
 Since 2014  the number of whole pangolin equivalents seized for trafficking globally has increased tenfold. Seizures represent only a fraction of the animals killed. Between 2014 and 2018  the equivalent of 370 000 pangolins were seized globally  suggesting that millions were trafficked and killed  despite a January 2017 ban on legal trade in all eight species. Currently  seized pangolins are primarily from Western and Central Africa and are intended for Asian markets. 
 Wildlife crime  such as illicit poaching and trafficking of pangolins and other animals  not only threatens ecosystem health and biodiversity. It also has the potential to disrupt human health  economic development and security around the world  as we are now witnessing first-hand.
