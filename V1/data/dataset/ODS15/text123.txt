The Red List Index of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)  which monitors the overall extinction risk for various species  shows a 10 per cent decline since 1993. Among 134 400 species assessed  28 per cent (more than 37 400 species) are threatened with extinction  including 41 per cent of amphibians  34 per cent of conifers  33 per cent of reef-building corals  26 per cent of mammals and 14 per cent of birds. The main drivers of species loss are agricultural and urban development; unsustainable harvesting through hunting  fishing  trapping and logging; and invasive alien species.
 Fortunately  conservation actions could stave off further species losses. For example  many bird and mammal species have benefited from invasive species control  conservation in zoos and other collections  and site protection. Since 1993  conservation actions have prevented the extinction of 21 to 32 species of birds and 7 to 16 species of mammals. Considering that 10 bird and 5 mammal species were confirmed or suspected to have been driven to extinction over this period  such actions have reduced extinction rates by three to four times compared with what would have been anticipated.
