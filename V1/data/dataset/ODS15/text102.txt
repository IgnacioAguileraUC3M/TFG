    Invasive alien species  including plants  animals  fungi and microorganisms  are recognized as one of the most serious causes of biodiversity loss and decline  after habitat loss. The impact is most severe for small island developing States. In response  the number of countries that have enacted national legislation to prevent and manage the spread of such species has increased by 19 per cent since 2010. Moreover  three quarters of countries that are party to the Convention on Biological Diversity have included relevant targets in their national biodiversity strategies. Over 88 per cent of 81 countries surveyed have a government department or national agency responsible for managing invasive species. However  over a third of these countries have no allocated budget for this effort and have not accessed any global mechanism to seek funding. To compound the problem  the overall rate of biological invasions shows no sign of slowing down  with growth in both the number of invasive species and their spread due to increased trade and transport.
