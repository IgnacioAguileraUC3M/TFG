Given the wide variation in the distribution of biodiversity and the threats to it around the planet  it is important that protected areas be located strategically. Safeguarding key biodiversity areas (KBAs) through the establishment of protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures is helping prevent the rapid loss of biodiversity. Globally  the mean percentage coverage of KBAs by protected areas increased from over one quarter in 2000 to nearly one half in 2021. Despite this encouraging trend  the growth of coverage has slowed in recent years. Moreover  coverage is uneven. Four regions  Northern Africa and Western Asia Central and Southern Asia  Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  and Oceania  still have mean coverage of less than 35 per cent across marine  terrestrial  freshwater and mountain KBAs.
