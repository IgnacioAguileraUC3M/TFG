
 Protecting sites that are important for terrestrial  freshwater and mountain biodiversityKBAsis vital to ensuring the long-term and sustainable use of natural resources. While progress has been made since 2000 in protecting KBAs  the rate of progress has slowed significantly since 2010.
 The global mean percentage of each terrestrial  freshwater and mountain KBA covered by protected areas increased by more than 10 percentage points between 2000 and 2010. However  from 2010 to 2018  the coverage only increased by two to three percentage points. At the current rate  by 2030  less than 50 per cent of each KBA will be covered by protected areas at the global level  on average.
