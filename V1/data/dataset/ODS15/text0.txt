Sustainably manage forests  combat desertification  halt and reverse land degradation  halt biodiversity loss
Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihood. Plant life provides 80 percent of our human diet  and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earths surface  providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as well as being crucial for combating climate change.
Today we are seeing unprecedented land degradation  and the loss of arable land at 30 to 35 times the historical rate. Drought and desertification is also on the rise each year  amounting to the loss of 12 million hectares and affects poor communities globally. Of the 8 300 animal breeds known  8 percent are extinct and 22 percent are at risk of extinction.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests  wetlands  drylands and mountains by 2020. Promoting the sustainable management of forests and halting deforestations is also vital to mitigating the impact of climate change. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage.
Conserving forests and other ecosystems is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
