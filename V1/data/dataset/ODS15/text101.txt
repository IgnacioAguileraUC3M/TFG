    The degradation of soil and land continues due to heightened competition for land use  undermining the security and development of all countries. From 1999 to 2013  approximately one fifth of the Earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity  primarily due to land and water use and management. Up to 24 million square kilometres of land are affected (an area the size of China  India and the United States of America combined)  including 19 per cent cropland  16 per cent forest land  19 per cent grassland and 28 per cent rangeland. For grasslands and rangelands  the global extent of areas experiencing declining productivity exceeds those showing increases. South America and Africa are most affected by diminished productivity: in some dryland areas  advanced stages of land degradation are leading to desertification. Reversing these worrying trends through sustainable land management is key to improving the livelihoods and resilience of over 1 billion people inhabiting degraded lands.
    

            Global map of land productivity  19992013
          

          Note: The map shows five classes of persistent land productivity trajectories over the period 19992013. Land productivity is an essential variable for detecting and monitoring active land transformations typically associated with land degradation processes. It can be expressed as an equivalent of terrestrial net primary productivity per unit of area and time  and reflects the overall capacity of land to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services.
