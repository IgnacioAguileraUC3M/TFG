The loss of forests has been uneven across regions  with the most dramatic declines occurring in sub-Saharan Africa  South-Eastern Asia and Latin America. This is primarily due to the conversion of forest to agricultural land  which is responsible for an estimated 73 per cent of forest loss in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the decline in forest area  the rate of forest loss has dropped by 25 per cent since the period 20002005.
    

    Sustainable forest management has demonstrated positive results in combating the continued loss of forests. Encouragingly  more land has been designated as permanent forest areas  coupled with planning  monitoring and stakeholder engagement and adoption of legal frameworks for sustainable forest management. Globally  the proportion of protected forest areas and forests under long-term management plans is increasing. Moreover  2017 data show a positive global trend in forest areas that have been independently certified as sustainably managed  with increases in most regions. However  deforestation and forest degradation are still concerns in some regions  particularly tropical regions  pointing to the need to fully implement sustainable forest- and land- management practices.
