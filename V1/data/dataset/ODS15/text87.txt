Goal 15: Protect  restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems  sustainably manage forests  combat desertification  and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Protected and restored ecosystems and the biodiversity they support can help mitigate climate change and provide increased resilience in the face of increased human pressures and mounting disasters. Healthy ecosystems also produce multiple benefits for all communities: clean air  water  food  raw materials and medicines  to name a few. To date  progress in preserving and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems and protecting biodiversity has been uneven. The pace of forest loss has slowed  and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and safeguarding areas important for biodiversity. That said  accelerating biodiversity loss  along with continued poaching and trafficking of wildlife  is alarming. Moreover  from 1998 to 2013  about one fifth of the Earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistently declining trends in productivity. Soil and land degradation undermines the security and development of all countries.

More key biodiversity areas are being protected  although progress has slowed in recent years

      Globally  15 per cent of terrestrial and freshwater environments are covered by protected areas. These areas can play a critical role in achieving sustainable development if they are effectively managed and strategically located. Protecting key biodiversity areas (KBAs)sites that contribute significantly to global biodiversityis necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. To date  more than 15 000 KBAs have been identified worldwide.
    

      Protecting key sites important for terrestrial  freshwater and mountain biodiversity is vital for ensuring long-term and sustainable use of these various natural resources. Globally  between 2000 and 2017  average coverage of terrestrial  freshwater and mountain KBAs by protected areas increased from 35 to 47 per cent  from 32 to 43 per cent  and from 39 to 49 per cent  respectively. While this upward trend is encouraging  recent growth in KBAs covered by protected areas has been modest  with an increase of only 1 to 2 percentage points since 2010.

The worlds forest area continues to shrink  but the rate of loss is slowing

    Forests protect watersheds  mitigate natural disasters  nurture biodiversity and sequester carbon. While the worlds forest area continues to shrink  the pace of forest loss has slowed. From 2010 to 2015  the annual net loss of forest area worldwide was less than half that of the 1990s. More forests are being protected  and areas under long-term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. The proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. Most forest loss can be attributed to deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Corals  amphibians and cycads face a growing threat of extinction

      Biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate  according to the Red List Index. The index measures trends in the extinction risk of various species. Available data indicate that three groupscorals  amphibians and cycadsare in serious decline due to distinct and worsening threats. Bleaching  driven by climate change and local impacts  has affected the health of coral reefs worldwide. Reefs support the highest level of marine biodiversity in the world  yet they are in jeopardy of disappearing completely by 2050. Severe bleaching events are already affecting reefs  as seen in the Great Barrier Reef during 2016 and 2017.
    

      Amphibians also face a high risk of extinction  with 41 per cent already threatened. Many amphibian species are found in a single location  and habitat loss and the spread of disease  such as chytrid fungal disease  present a grave danger. Meanwhile  many cycads  an ancient group of cone-producing plants  are threatened by unsustainable exploitation and habitat destruction.

          Note: A Red List Index value of 1.0 means that all species are categorized as of  Least concern ; hence  none are expected to become extinct in the near future. A value of zero indicates that all species have gone extinct.

Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife poses a threat to the survival of many species

    Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts  with nearly 7 000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. Illicitly trafficked species are normally found far from their original source after having been transported through multiple countries. Iconic species  such as tigers  elephants and rhinos  along with many lesser-known animals  plants and marine life  face intense pressures for survival. Poached and trafficked wildlife are found in many distinct and often-unrelated markets. They are used in a range of industries  from furniture to fashion  each subject to unique dynamics and volatile trafficking patterns. Demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly  before the international community can effectively respond. In 2013  elephant ivory  rosewood  rhinoceros horn and reptiles comprised 70 per cent of total wildlife seizures. Addressing these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of markets that make use of wild-sourced materials and products  along with greater regulation of these sectors.

          Note: Other wildlife include corals  sturgeons  marine turtles  parrots  big cats  tortoises  raptors and others. To combine seizures of disparate wildlife products  some common unit is required  and measures such as quantity and weight will not suffice. The  standard value  used here is based on declared import values for similar legal products in a reference market and is intended to give a sense of relative value  not an absolute monetary valuation.
