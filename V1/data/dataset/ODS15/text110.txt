
 Healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to the provision of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland peoples living far from mountain peaks. For example  mountains are the source of 60 to 80 per cent of the worlds freshwater  which is used for domestic  agricultural and industrial consumption  green energy production and biodiversity conservation. Green coverage of mountain areas (by forests  grasslands/shrublands and croplands) is positively correlated to mountains state of health and  consequently  to their capacity to fulfil their ecosystem roles. 
 A global baseline of mountain area green coverage has now been established using 2017 data. That year  76 per cent of mountain areas globally were covered with vegetation: in Oceania  almost all mountain areas were covered  while in Northern Africa and Western Asia  the share was only 60 per cent.
