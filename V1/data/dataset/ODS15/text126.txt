 Invasive alien species are animals  plants or other organisms introduced by humans into ecosystems outside their natural range  which have become established and negatively affect native biodiversity. Such species are a major driver of biodiversity loss and species extinction. They also negatively impact ecosystem services  human livelihoods and well-being  and economies. Invasive alien species are introduced to new areas either intentionally  by hunting or fishing  for example  or unintentionally  through a contaminant on traded goods  for instance  or as a hitchhiker on vehicles or boats. With the increased movement of people and goods around the world  the number of established alien species is expected to increase by 36 per cent between 2005 and 2050.
 Preventing the introduction of invasive alien species is the most cost-effective way to address their impacts  which are estimated to cost the global economy billions of dollars annually.   Governments are responding. Nearly all countries (98 per cent) now have national legislation to prevent or control invasive alien species  but the sectoral coverage of such legislation varies widely. Most countries have adopted legislation relevant to plant and animal health in agriculture (92 per cent and 82 per cent  respectively)  but fewer have legislation focused on the environment (42 per cent) or fisheries and aquaculture (27 per cent).
 Adequate resources are crucial to an effective response. However  only 55 per cent of countries have reported allocations from their national budgets to deal with invasive species  while only 37 per cent have accessed global financing mechanisms.
