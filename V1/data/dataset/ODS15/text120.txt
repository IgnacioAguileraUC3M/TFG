 Conservation of terrestrial ecosystems is not trending towards sustainability. Forest areas continue to decline at an alarming rate  protected areas are not concentrated in sites known for their biological diversity  and species remain threatened with extinction. Moreover  surging wildlife crime  land use changes such as deforestation  and habitat encroachment are primary pathways of transmission for emerging infectious diseases  including COVID-19  threatening public health and the world economy.
 Valiant efforts are being made to turn the tide. These include the expansion of sustainable forest management and gains in protected area coverage for terrestrial  freshwater and mountain areas. Countries are making progress in implementing programmatic  legislative and accounting principles to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. In order to build back better following the global pandemic  these gains need to be solidified and reinforced. Equally important is the need to foster awareness of the interconnections between people and the natural world to ensure more balanced coexistence.
