A fundamental measure of their efficacy is the extent to which they include places that contribute significantly to the maintenance of global biodiversity  such as key biodiversity areas (KBAs). Globally  the percentage of terrestrial  inland freshwater and mountain KBAs covered by protected areas has increased from 16.5 per cent to 19.3 per cent  13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent  and 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent  respectively  from 2000 to 2016. Safeguarding KBAs around the globe in all three ecosystems is critically important for maintaining genetic  species  and ecosystem diversity  and in turn the benefits they provide to people.
