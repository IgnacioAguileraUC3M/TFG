 Ending environmental decline and restoring our planet is fundamental to sustainable development. Nevertheless  forests are being cut down  biological diversity is declining  and terrestrial ecosystems are being degraded at alarming rates  with profound consequences for human survival and well-being. Land degradation now affects one fifth of the Earths land area. Wildlife trafficking threatens human health  economic development and security through the spread of zoonotic diseases (transmitted from animals to humans)  which now represent the majority of emerging infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that by threatening biodiversity  humanity threatens its own survival.
 To address these challenges  considerable efforts are being made to expand sustainable forest management and to protect sites critical to biodiversity. Countries are also enacting legislation and accounting principles to make nature count and to address threats to biodiversity  such as the growing spread of invasive alien species. It is time to put the health of the planet at the centre of all our plans and policies.
