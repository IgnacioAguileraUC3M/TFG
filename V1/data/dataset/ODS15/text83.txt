According to the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List Index  amphibians are declining most rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean  primarily owing to the chytrid fungal disease  one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. The greatest increases in extinction risk for birds and mammals have occurred in South-Eastern Asia  mainly driven by the conversion of lowland forests. On average  the extinction risk for coral species is increasing most rapidly  while cycad species (an ancient group of cone-producing plants) are the most severely threatened species group assessed. However  the loss of species is not inevitable: extinction risks for vertebrate species have been reversed in five small island developing States (Cook Islands  Fiji  Mauritius  Seychelles and Tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the last several decades.
    

            Red List Index* of species survival  1993-2016
          

          * The Red List Index for each region is based on the aggregate survival probability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all birds  mammals  amphibians  corals and cycads occurring within the region  weighted by the fraction of each species distribution within the region. Values range from 1.0  which indicates a minimum contribution to the global index (i.e.  all species in the region are classified as Least Concern) to zero  which indicates the maximum possible contribution to the global index (i.e.  all species in the region are classified as Extinct).
