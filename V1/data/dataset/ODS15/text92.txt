Available data indicate that three groupscorals  amphibians and cycadsare in serious decline due to distinct and worsening threats. Bleaching  driven by climate change and local impacts  has affected the health of coral reefs worldwide. Reefs support the highest level of marine biodiversity in the world  yet they are in jeopardy of disappearing completely by 2050. Severe bleaching events are already affecting reefs  as seen in the Great Barrier Reef during 2016 and 2017.
    

      Amphibians also face a high risk of extinction  with 41 per cent already threatened. Many amphibian species are found in a single location  and habitat loss and the spread of disease  such as chytrid fungal disease  present a grave danger. Meanwhile  many cycads  an ancient group of cone-producing plants  are threatened by unsustainable exploitation and habitat destruction.

          Note: A Red List Index value of 1.0 means that all species are categorized as of  Least concern ; hence  none are expected to become extinct in the near future. A value of zero indicates that all species have gone extinct.
