 Globally  one fifth of the Earths land area (more than 2 billion hectares)  an area nearly the size of India and the Russian Federation combined  is degraded. Land degradation is undermining the wellbeing of some 3.2 billion people  driving species to extinction and intensifying climate change. From 2000 to 2015  global trends in land cover indicated a net loss in natural and semi-natural classes of land. These losses resulted from direct and indirect factors  including deforestation  unsustainable agricultural practices and urbanization  as well as land tenure and poverty. Land use change  a key driver of land degradation  is also one of the primary transmission pathways for emerging infectious diseases.
 By early 2020  123 countries had committed to setting voluntary targets to achieve land degradation neutrality  a global target adopted in the 2030 Agenda  and 60 countries had officially endorsed those targets. Reversing the current trend in land degradation would not only improve biodiversity and the well-being of billions of people  it would contribute positively to the climate crisis through restoration  conservation and other land management actions.
