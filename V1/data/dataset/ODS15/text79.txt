This loss was mainly due to the conversion of forests to other uses  such as agriculture and infrastructure development. Meanwhile  other areas returned to forests through planting  landscape restoration or natural expansion. As a result of these ongoing processes and efforts to slow deforestation  the global net loss in forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period 2010-2015. Progress across regions is mixed: Latin America and the Caribbean  sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia accounted for the largest losses in forest area  whereas Eastern Asia accounted for the largest gains.
