The risk of species extinction is increasing at a rate unprecedented in human history. The Red List Index  which measures the overall extinction risk of species in selected taxonomic groups  reveals a deterioration of 9.2 per cent between 2000 and 2022. Wide variations are found among regions in both the overall prevalence of extinction risk and the rate of deterioration. Central and Southern Asia  Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  and small island developing States suffer from more severe risk and faster deterioration than the global average. The main drivers of these declines are the unsustainability of agriculture and the over-harvest of wild species. Human activities such as logging and farming are encroaching upon habitats  putting about 20 per cent of reptile species  for example  at risk. To conserve and sustainably use biodiversity  key actions are urgently needed  including reversing the net loss of habitat  transforming land management and transitioning to sustainable agriculture.
