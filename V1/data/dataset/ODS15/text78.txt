Goal 15: Protect  restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems  sustainably manage forests  combat desertification  and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

  Preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect  restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other ecosystems. Goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably  halting and reversing land and natural habitat degradation  successfully combating desertification and stopping biodiversity loss. All these efforts combined aim to ensure that the benefits of land-based ecosystems  including sustainable livelihoods  will be enjoyed for generations to come.
  

Net forest loss has decreased by more than half since the 1990s  but the loss of forests continues

    Between 1990 and 2015  the worlds forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent of the worlds total land mass to 30.7 per cent. This loss was mainly due to the conversion of forests to other uses  such as agriculture and infrastructure development. Meanwhile  other areas returned to forests through planting  landscape restoration or natural expansion. As a result of these ongoing processes and efforts to slow deforestation  the global net loss in forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period 2010-2015. Progress across regions is mixed: Latin America and the Caribbean  sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia accounted for the largest losses in forest area  whereas Eastern Asia accounted for the largest gains.

Key biodiversity areas are increasingly covered by protected areas

    In 2014  15.2 per cent of the worlds terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas  which are recognized  dedicated and managed to achieve the long-term conservation of nature. A fundamental measure of their efficacy is the extent to which they include places that contribute significantly to the maintenance of global biodiversity  such as key biodiversity areas (KBAs). Globally  the percentage of terrestrial  inland freshwater and mountain KBAs covered by protected areas has increased from 16.5 per cent to 19.3 per cent  13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent  and 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent  respectively  from 2000 to 2016. Safeguarding KBAs around the globe in all three ecosystems is critically important for maintaining genetic  species  and ecosystem diversity  and in turn the benefits they provide to people.

In every region the survival of species is increasingly threatened

    As of 2015  over 23 000 species of plants  fungi and animals were known to face a high probability of extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List Index  amphibians are declining most rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean  primarily owing to the chytrid fungal disease  one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. The greatest increases in extinction risk for birds and mammals have occurred in South-Eastern Asia  mainly driven by the conversion of lowland forests. On average  the extinction risk for coral species is increasing most rapidly  while cycad species (an ancient group of cone-producing plants) are the most severely threatened species group assessed. However  the loss of species is not inevitable: extinction risks for vertebrate species have been reversed in five small island developing States (Cook Islands  Fiji  Mauritius  Seychelles and Tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the last several decades.
    

            Red List Index* of species survival  1993-2016
          

          * The Red List Index for each region is based on the aggregate survival probability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all birds  mammals  amphibians  corals and cycads occurring within the region  weighted by the fraction of each species distribution within the region. Values range from 1.0  which indicates a minimum contribution to the global index (i.e.  all species in the region are classified as Least Concern) to zero  which indicates the maximum possible contribution to the global index (i.e.  all species in the region are classified as Extinct).

Illegal trade in wildlife is a global phenomenon with distinct regional variations

    The list of species under international protection continues to grow. At the same time  conservation efforts are being thwarted by the poaching and trafficking of wildlife  crimes that are occurring worldwide. Since 1999  at least 7 000 species of animals and plants have been reported in illegal trade affecting 120 countries. Trafficking in wildlife affects all regions of the world  whether as a source  transit location or destination. Trafficking in birds is most common in Central and South America  mammals in Asia and Africa  reptiles in Europe and North America  and corals in Oceania.
