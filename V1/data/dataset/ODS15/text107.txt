
 The loss of global biodiversity is accelerating  moving us closer towards unknown and irreversible changes to the Earths ecosystems. According to the Red List Index  which tracks data on more than 20 000 species of mammals  birds  amphibians  corals and cycads  the risk of species extinction has worsened by about 10 per cent over the last 25 years. The Index declined from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.74 in 2018. Further  the latest report of the Intergovernmental Science- Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services noted that biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history. 
 The primary drivers of that assault are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture  deforestation  unsustainable harvest and trade  climate change and alien invasive species. But even against such an ominous backdrop are numerous examples of species recovery following conservation interventions  including in small island developing States such as Fiji  Mauritius and the Seychelles. Accelerated action is needed to safeguard critically endangered species and mainstream extinction risk reduction across agriculture  industry  trade and other sectors.
