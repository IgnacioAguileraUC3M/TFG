The worlds forest area continues to decline  but at a slightly slower rate than in previous decades. The proportion of forests fell from 31.9per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020  representing a net loss of almost 100million hectares. Agricultural expansion is driving almost 90 per cent of global deforestation  including 49.6 per cent from expansion for cropland and 38.5 per cent for livestock grazing.
Changes in forest area vary widely from region to region. Asia  Europe and Northern America showed an overall increase in forest area from 2000 to 2020 due to afforestation  landscape restoration and the natural expansion of forests. In contrast  significant losses were observed in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa  mostly due to the conversion of forests into agricultural land.
The felling of forests continues  despite major gains in several regions. Between 2010 and 2021  the area of forest land under certification schemes increased by 35 per cent. The proportion of forests under a long-term management plan increased from 54 per cent in 2010 to 58 per cent in 2020. More than 700 million hectares of forest (18 per cent) were in legally established protected areas in 2020.
While nearly all forests in Central Asia  Europe and Western Asia fall under a management plan  the managed proportion remains low in Latin America and the Caribbean  Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa.
