Biodiversity directly or indirectly contributes to the attainment of most SDGs. The number of countries incorporating ecosystem and biodiversity values into national accounting and reporting systems is steadily trending upwards. The majority of countries have established national targets in this regard  in accordance with the Aichi Biodiversity Target 22  of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 20112020. By January 2022  37 per cent of countries assessed are on track to achieve or exceed their national targets; 58 per cent have made progress towards their targets but at an insufficient rate; and 5 per cent reported that they are making no headway or moving away from their national targets. Despite important gains  Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 was not met by 2020. Building back better from COVID-19 is an opportunity to integrate biodiversity considerations into economic recovery measures to build a more sustainable future  while reducing the risk of future pandemics. However  this opportunity is not being seized. To date   biodiversity has been a largely neglected area in recovery spending.
