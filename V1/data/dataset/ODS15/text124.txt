 The protection of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) has long been considered a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation. In 2020  on average  43 per cent of each terrestrial KBA  42 per cent of each freshwater KBA and 41 per cent of each mountain KBA were within protected areas  an increase of around 13 to 14 percentage points since 2000. However  increases in coverage have plateaued over the last five years. On average  more than half of each KBA remains outside of protected areas.
 Carefully targeted policy interventions can safeguard KBAs and the communities that depend on them. In Cameroon  in August 2020  the Government cancelled a logging operation in the Ebo Forest  which makes up half of the Yabassi KBA. Ebo is a large intact forest system that is home to 12 species of plants found nowhere else on Earth. Animal inhabitants include gorillas  chimpanzees  forest elephants  Preusss red colobus monkeys and many others. Ebo Forest is also the ancestral land of more than 40 communities whose livelihoods are intertwined with the areas abundant and diverse natural resources.
