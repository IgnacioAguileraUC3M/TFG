Taking into account inflation and the rise in the value of the dollar in 2015  this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in 2014  and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from DAC countries as a share of their gross national income (GNI) was 0.30 per cent  on par with 2014. Most of the increase was due to higher expenditures for refugee costs. However  even if those costs are excluded  ODA still rose by 1.7 per cent. In 2015  seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of GNI: Denmark  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden  the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
