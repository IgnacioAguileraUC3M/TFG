ODA as a percentage of member countries gross national income (GNI) was 0.32 per cent  up from 0.30 per cent in 2015. A rise in aid spent on refugees in donor countries boosted the total. Even without refugee costs taken into account  aid rose 7.1 per cent. In 2016  Germany joined five other countries Denmark  Luxembourg  Norway  Sweden and the United Kingdom in meeting the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of GNI.
    

      Despite this progress  2016 data show that bilateral (country-tocountry) aid to LDCs fell by 3.9 per cent in real terms from 2015. Aid to Africa fell by 0.5 per cent as some DAC members backtracked on a commitment to reverse past declines in flows to the poorest countries. ODA spent on hosting refugees inside donor countries jumped by 27.5 per cent in real terms from 2015 to reach 15.4 billion US dollars. The DAC is working to adjust ODA reporting rules to help ensure that funding for development is not diverted to in-donor refugee costs.
