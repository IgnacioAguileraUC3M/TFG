Since the emergence of COVID-19  the Internet has become vital for working  learning  accessing basic services and keeping in touch. The latest data show that uptake of the Internet has accelerated during the pandemic. In 2019  4.1 billion people (or 54 per cent of the worlds population) were using the Internet. The number of users surged by 782 million to reach 4.9 billion people in 2021  or 63 per cent of the global population. In 2020  the first year of the pandemic  the number of Internet users grew by 10.2 per cent. This was the largest increase in a decade  driven by developing countries  where Internet use went up by 13.3 per cent. In 2021  growth returned to a more modest 5.8 per cent  in line with pre-crisis rates. The number of Internet users in LDCs increased by 20 per cent and accounted for 27 per cent of the user population between 2019 and 2021.
Fixed broadband subscriptions continue to grow steadily  reaching a global average of 17 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2021. In LDCs  despite double-digit growth  fixed broadband remains a privilege of the few  with only 1.4 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.
