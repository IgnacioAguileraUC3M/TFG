In 2016  international remittances totalled 575 billion US dollars  75 per cent of which (429 billion US dollars) went to developing countries  according to the latest estimates. However  remittances to developing countries in 2016 fell for a second consecutive year  declining by 2.4 per cent over 2015. Low oil prices and weak economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and the Russian Federation are taking a toll on remittance flows to Central and Southern Asia  while weak growth in Europe has reduced flows to Northern and sub-Saharan Africa. The contribution of remittances to the income of countries has been growing significantly over the last 15 years and exceeded 4 per cent of GDP for LDCs in 2015.
