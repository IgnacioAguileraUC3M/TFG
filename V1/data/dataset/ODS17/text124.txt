Still  it represented only a small fraction of global exports in 2014  at 1.1 per cent. For developing regions more generally   erchandise exports grew by nearly 40 per cent and amounted to almost 45 per cent of global exports in 2014. In comparison  service exports from developing regions lagged behind  accounting for about 30 per cent of total exports. The key driver of export growth during this period was a massive rise in the price of fuel  ores and metals  reflecting a high demand in developing countries  notably China.

      While tariffs on agricultural products from least developed countries have declined  those on clothing and textiles remain high
    

          Average tariffs imposed by developed countries on imports from least developed countries declined steadily for all product groups until 2005. After that year  the average tariff for agricultural products continued to decline  reaching less than 1 per cent in 2014. Tariff rates are still high for clothing and textiles exports from least developed countries due to the exclusion of some large Asian exporters from certain preferential tariffs.

      National statistical plans need to be updated in many countries
    

          A national statistical plan is key to strengthening a nation's statistical system. The requirements of the MDG indicators have gone a long way towards fostering stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions and country groups between 2010 and 2015  including the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. However  many are still without a plan. The overall number of small island developing States with a statistical plan actually declined from nine to seven over this period  as the time period for some existing plans expired.

      In 2013  least developed countries received more than 80 per cent of ODA targeted for capacity-building in statistics
    

          Financial support to build national capacity in statistics amounted to 325 million US dollars in 2013 compared with 379 million US dollars in 2010  a decline of 14 per cent. However  assistance to the least developed countries tripled during this period  reaching 265 million US dollars. This means that 82 per cent of all financial support for statistical capacity-building went to the least developed countries in 2013. South-Eastern Asia  Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa were the biggest beneficiaries of this shift in funding priorities. Despite a growing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence-based policy-making and development  the share of ODA dedicated to statistics  hovered at around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.

      Population and housing censuses are still not conducted in all countries
    

          Population and housing censuses are an important source of disaggregated data needed to formulate  implement and monitor development policies. During the 10-year period from 2006 to 2015  96 per cent of countries in developed regions conducted at least one population and housing census. The share in developing regions as a whole was 88 per cent  dropping to 67 per cent and 69 per cent  respectively  in Southern Asia and Western Asia.

      Death registration  a crucial source of data on health related sustainable development indicators  remains far from universal
    

          Over the period 20102014  death registration data were available for 145 out of 230 countries and territories. Of these  128 had data that were at least 75 per cent complete. Death registration coverage is lowest in Africa and Asia. Information on deaths  especially when it is complete and disaggregated  is key to producing a number of basic health statistics and indicators.
