      High-speed fixed broadband Internet connection remains largely inaccessible across the developing world
    

      Despite a global rise in subscriptions for high-speed fixed broadband  access to this type of Internet connection remains largely unavailable for residents across the developing world. In 2016  only 6 per cent of the population in these countries had access to high-speed fixed broadband Internet  compared to 24 per cent in the developed regions. Such access can enhance international cooperation  improve access to science  technology and innovation  and facilitate knowledge-sharing. Conversely  limitations in the capacity and speed of fixed-broadband connections affect the quality and functionality of this development tool  widening existing inequalities.
