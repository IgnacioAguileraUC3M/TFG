 Between 2017 and 2019  the worldwide weighted tariff average remained stable at around 2 per cent. Moreover  exports of developing countries and LDCs have been given preferential treatment by developed countries. After reaching the lowest level ever of about 1.1 per cent in 2011  the average tariff applied by developed countries to imports from developing countries and LDCs has remained flat due to a lack of new commitments. Agriculture  a particular concern for developing countries  accounted for the highest tariff imposed by developed countries in 2019 (7.9 per cent). 
 The share of LDC exports in global merchandise trade remained constant in 2019 at 1 per cent. Over the last decade that share has stagnated  after significant improvements from 2000 to 2010  largely due to a commodities boom. The target of doubling the global share of LDC exports by 2020 from the 2011 level (increasing it to 2 per cent) is unlikely to have been achieved.
