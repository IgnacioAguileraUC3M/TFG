      Stagnation in global trade since 2011 has been accompanied by a break in the expansion of world market shares among developing regions and LDCs. Among developing regions  the share of global merchandise exports declined for two consecutive years: from 45.4 per cent in 2014 to 44.2 per cent in 2016  a sharp contrast to an average annual increase of 1.2 percentage points between 2001 and 2012. Among LDCs  the share of global merchandise exports decreased from 1.1 per cent in 2013 to 0.9 per cent in 2016  compared to a rise from 0.6 per cent to 1.1 per cent between 2000 and 2013. A similar trend was seen for service exports: the LDC share of such exports stood at 0.74 per cent in 2016  a slight drop from the 2013 level. Much of the decline in their share of global exports can be attributed to a drop in commodity prices  since exports from many LDCs are concentrated in primary commodities such as minerals  ores and fuels.
