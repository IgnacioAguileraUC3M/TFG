 Defying predictions  officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached $540 billion in 2020  only 1.6 per cent below the 2019 level. Drivers included fiscal stimulus that resulted in better-than-expected economic conditions in host countries  a shift in flows from cash to digital and from informal to formal channels  and cyclical movements in oil prices and currency exchange rates. Remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries surpassed FDI for a second year. Remittances have become an important consumption-smoothing mechanism for recipient households. As such  they form an increasingly important (private) element of global social protection systems. Remittance flows rose by 6.5 per cent to Latin America and the Caribbean  by 5.2 per cent to Southern Asia  and by 2.3 per cent to the Middle East and Northern Africa. Flows to sub-Saharan Africa fell by 12.5 per cent  by 9.7 per cent to Europe and Central Asia  and by 7.9 per cent to Eastern Asia and the Pacific.
