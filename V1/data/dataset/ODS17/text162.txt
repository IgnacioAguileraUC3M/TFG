 Net ODA totalled $149 billion in 2018  down by 2.7 per cent in real terms from 2017. The decline was largely due to a reduction in donor country aid for hosting refugees. Aid for bilateral projects  programmes and technical assistance  which represents over half of total net ODA  rose by 1.3 per cent in real terms from 2017 to 2018. Contributions to multilateral organizations  which represent about one third of total net ODA  were stable. Humanitarian aid fell by 8 per cent in real terms. 
 ODA is the largest source of external financing for LDCs. Nevertheless  in 2018  less aid went to LDCs and African countries  where it is needed most. Preliminary figures indicate that bilateral ODA to LDCs fell by 3 per cent in real terms from 2017  and aid to Africa fell by 4 per cent. Donor countries are not living up to their pledge to ramp up development finance  tamping down efforts to achieve global Goals.
