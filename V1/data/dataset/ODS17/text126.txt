The requirements of the MDG indicators have gone a long way towards fostering stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions and country groups between 2010 and 2015  including the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. However  many are still without a plan. The overall number of small island developing States with a statistical plan actually declined from nine to seven over this period  as the time period for some existing plans expired.
