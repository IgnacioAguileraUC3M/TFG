 In 2020  FDI fell by up to 40 per cent  dropping below $1 trillion (from $1.5 trillion in 2019) for the first time since 2005. Lockdown measures slowed existing investment projects  and the prospect of a deep recession led multinational enterprises to reassess new projects. Policy measures taken by Governments included new investment restrictions.
 International private sector investment flows to developing and transition economies in sectors relevant to the SDGs fell by about one third in 2020. Except for renewable energy (where growth in new projects continued but was cut to one third of the pre-COVID level)  investment activity fell sharply across all SDG sectors  with the fall more pronounced in poorer regions. Looking ahead  the projection for FDI is gloomy in 2021. Related risks include the latest wave of the pandemic  the slow pace of the vaccination roll-out and uncertainty about the global investment policy environment.
