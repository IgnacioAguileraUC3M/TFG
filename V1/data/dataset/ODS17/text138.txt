Moreover  developing regions overall have maintained a trade surplus vis--vis the rest of the world. However  the share in world merchandise exports from LDCs decreased from 1.1 per cent to 0.9 per cent between 2011 and 2015. Much of this change can be attributed to a fall in commodity prices  since exports from many LDCs are concentrated in primary commodities  such as minerals  ores and fuels. On the other hand  the share of LDCs in world services exports increased from 0.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent from 2001 to 2015.
