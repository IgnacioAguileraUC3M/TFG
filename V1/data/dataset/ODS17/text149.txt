  Official development assistance dropped slightly in 2017  due to lower costs for refugee assistance
  

      In 2017  net official development assistance (ODA) from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) totalled $146.6 billion. This represents a slight drop (of 0.6 per cent) in real terms from the 2016 level. The decline is mainly attributed to lower spending on refugees inside donor countries: in 2017  DAC countries reportedly spent $14.2 billion  or 9.7 per cent of total ODA  to host refugees in their countries; this represents a drop of 13.6 per cent in real terms compared to 2016. Bilateral ODA from DAC countries to LDCs increased by 4.0 per cent in real terms since 2016.
    

      The United Nations has set a benchmark for ODA contributions of at least 0.7 per cent of a countrys gross national income (GNI). However  only five DAC countriesDenmark  Luxembourg  Norway  Sweden and the United Kingdommet this target. Overall  ODA remained at 0.31 per cent of GNI in 2017. Humanitarian aid totalled $15.5 billion in 2017  an increase of 6.1 per cent in real terms compared to 2016.
