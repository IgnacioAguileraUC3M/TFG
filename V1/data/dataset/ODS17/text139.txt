In 2015  they stood at 0.9 per cent for agricultural products  6.5 per cent for clothing and 3.2 per cent for textiles. Tariffs applied to imports from developing countries also remained largely unchanged in recent years  but were higher than those applied to major exports of LDCs  at 8.0 per cent for agricultural products  7.7 per cent for clothing and 5.0 per cent for textiles in 2015. A slight increase in applied tariffs to products from developing countries is largely explained by the exclusion of China and Thailand from the European Unions Generalised Scheme of Preferences  which took effect in January 2015. The textile sector is most affected by this change.

      Progress is ongoing in the monitoring of development effectiveness and in respecting countries policy space
    

          In 2016  125 countries engaged in country-led monitoring of development effectiveness  demonstrating their commitment to strengthening SDG implementation and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Of these countries  54 reported overall progress towards those commitments. For instance  countries reported progress in recording development cooperation on national budgets submitted for parliamentary oversight  and in tracking budget allocations for gender equality and womens empowerment.
        

          Countries own results frameworks were used to identify 83 per cent of new interventions supported by donor countries in 2016. Fifty-seven per cent of results indicators in these new interventions were drawn from country-led results frameworks and about half (51 per cent) used data from national monitoring systems to track results. The extent to which development partners use country-led results frameworks is one indication of the respect accorded to a countrys policy space and its leadership in establishing its own path towards sustainable development.

      Only 17 countries  mostly in Europe and Northern America  have fully funded national statistical plans
    

          More than half of the countries or areas for which information is available (81 out of 154) were implementing national statistical plans in 2016. Among the 17 countries with fully funded plans  11 are located in Europe and Northern America. Such plans lay out the strategy by which a country can develop statistical capacity throughout its entire national statistical system. By designing  implementing and monitoring this strategic vision  countries can better respond to the growing demand for high-quality  timely  disaggregated and accessible data.
        

          Only 37 out of 83 countries or areas with relevant information had national statistical legislation in place that complied with all 10 Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Solid and politically backed statistical legislation is required to ensure that the Fundamental Principles and other professional and scientific standards are being followed in the production of official statistics.

      Financial support for statistics from official development assistance remains low
    

          In 2014  developing countries received 338 million US dollars in financial support for statistics. While this represented an increase of nearly 2.9 per cent from 2010  it accounted for only 0.18 per cent of total ODA. The main beneficiaries in 2014 were countries in sub-Saharan Africa (214 million US dollars)  followed by countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (73 million US dollars). Continued effort and financial support are needed to ensure that developing countries have the capacity to better monitor progress on their own national policy objectives and international initiatives. To meet the data needs of the SDGs  developing countries will need an estimated 1 billion US dollars in statistical support annually from domestic and donor sources.

      While the population and housing census remains a key data source  25 countries failed to conduct one in the period 2007-2016
    

          Population and housing censuses are a primary source of disaggregated data needed to formulate  implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the period from 2007 to 2016  89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census. Owing to a variety of factors  25 countries or areas failed to conduct a census over the same period. These included financial constraints  technical difficulties encountered in their preparation  natural disasters  and political and social instability. Among these countries or areas  nine were in sub-Saharan Africa and seven were in Northern Africa and Western Asia.

      Complete birth and death registration is far from universal  especially in sub-Saharan Africa
    

          From 2010 to 2015  56 per cent of the worlds countries or areas (138 out of 246) had birth registration data that were at least 90 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa  only 8 out of 53 countries achieved this coverage. A child who is not registered at birth risks being denied the right to an official identity and is more likely to join the millions facing discrimination and lack of access to basic services. Over the same six years  144 countries or areas  or 59 per cent  had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa  only 9 in 53 countries met this standard. Death registration data are crucial for many health indicators and for policy planning purposes. Even in countries with functioning civil registration systems  coverage of birth and death registration  and complete reporting of vital statistics remain a challenge.
