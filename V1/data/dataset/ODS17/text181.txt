 Net ODA flows by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached $161 billion in 2020  an increase of 7 per cent in real terms from 2019  driven by members support of an inclusive global recovery in light of the pandemic and an increase in bilateral sovereign lending by some loan-giving members. Net ODA flows represented 0.32 per cent of donors combined gross national income (GNI) in 2020  falling short of the 0.7 per cent target. Most members were able to maintain their planned ODA commitments  and some were able to rapidly mobilize additional funding. But more is needed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. 
 Net bilateral flows to low-income countries were $25 billion  a decrease of 3.5 per cent in real terms compared with 2019. Net bilateral ODA increased by 6.9 per cent to lower-middle-income countries  and by 36.1 per cent to upper-middle-income countries  reaching $33 billion and $18 billion  respectively.
