Although official development assistance (ODA) increased and remittance flows declined less than expected in 2020  foreign direct investment (FDI) dropped by 40 per cent. The impacts of the pandemic are leading to debt distress in many countries  and also limiting countries fiscal and policy space for critical investments in recovery (including access to vaccines)  climate action and the SDGs  threatening to prolong recovery periods. The interconnected global economy requires a global response to ensure that all countries  developing countries in particular  can address compounding and parallel health  economic and environmental crises and recover better. Strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships is more important than ever.
