          Population and housing censuses provide basic information on the size  growth  distribution  location and characteristics of a countrys population. They result in a wide range of statistical information  allowing detailed disaggregation of data needed to formulate  implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the decade from 2008 to 2017  89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.
        

          On the other hand  coverage of birth and death registration and the completeness of vital statistics remains a challenge  even among countries that have functioning civil registration systems. Over the period 2012-2016  143 countries or areas had birth registration data that were at least 90 per cent complete; in sub-Saharan Africa  only 8 out of 53 countries met this standard. Over the same period  148 countries or areas had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete; in sub-Saharan Africa  this was the case in only 9 out of 53 countries.
        
Proportion of countries that conducted at least one population and housing census  2008-2017; proportion of countries with death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete and proportion of countries with birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete  2012-2016 (percentage)
