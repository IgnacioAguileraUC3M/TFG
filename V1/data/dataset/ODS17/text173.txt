 Global merchandise trade is projected to decline by 13 to 32 per cent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade-weighted tariffs decreased from 2.2 per cent in 2017 to an average of 2.1 per cent worldwide in 2018. The preferential tariffs offered by World Trade Organization members providing unilateral concessions of preferences have reached an average low level of 1.1 per cent for both developing countries and LDCs. Difficulties in complying with conditions for preferential treatment  and the increasing number of trade agreements among developed countries  may narrow the window of opportunity that these rates offer to developing country exporters. 
 The share of LDC exports in global merchandise trade was just above 1 per cent in 2018  a slight increase from 2017. This is roughly the same level of 10 years ago  and far from the target of doubling by 2020. The share of global exports in services of LDCs reached 0.8 per cent in 2018. However  participation remains concentrated within a few economies  particularly in Asian countries  with most other LDCs struggling to export services internationally.
