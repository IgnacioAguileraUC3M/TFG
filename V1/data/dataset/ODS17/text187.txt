
 Since the adoption of the SDGs  funding for data and statistics has increased four years in a row. It grew from $591 million in 2015 to $693 million in 2018  with significant increases for SIDS  landlocked developing countries and LDCs. However  support was levelling off in 2019. Despite a surge in data demand to inform pandemic-related policymaking  development support to data and statistics has not risen commensurately. A recent survey found that 63 per cent of low-income and lower-middle-income countries are in need of additional financing for data and statistics to face the challenges posed by COVID-19. 
 In 2020  132 countries and territories reported that they were implementing a national statistical plan  with 84 having plans that were fully funded. Only 4 out of the 46 LDCs reported having fully funded national statistical plans that year. Countries could face more difficulties in implementing and funding such plans due to costly and labour-intensive activities (such as censuses and household surveys) that were moved to 2021 due to the pandemic.
