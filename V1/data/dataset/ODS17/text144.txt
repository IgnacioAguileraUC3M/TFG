In sub-Saharan Africa  only 8 out of 53 countries achieved this coverage. A child who is not registered at birth risks being denied the right to an official identity and is more likely to join the millions facing discrimination and lack of access to basic services. Over the same six years  144 countries or areas  or 59 per cent  had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa  only 9 in 53 countries met this standard. Death registration data are crucial for many health indicators and for policy planning purposes. Even in countries with functioning civil registration systems  coverage of birth and death registration  and complete reporting of vital statistics remain a challenge.
