 In 2019  86 per cent of the population in Europe and Northern America were using the Internet  and most people in that region were able to work  shop and learn remotely during COVID-19 lockdowns. In Central and Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  just over a quarter of the population were connected. The cost of Internet access and Internet-connected devices  and the lack of related skills  are the highest barriers to access for large parts of the world. 
 To ensure no one is left behind  continued collective efforts are needed to connect the remaining 49 per cent of the worlds population. A close collaboration among governments  policymakers and network operators is required to bring them fully online. Fixed broadband has a significant impact on the world economy. In LDCs  fixed networks are almost completely absent  with only 1.3 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.
