
 In 2019  most countries reported that they were carrying out a national statistical plan (141 countries  up from 129 in 2018). However  many also said that they lacked sufficient funding for full implementation. Only 25 per cent of plans were fully funded in sub-Saharan Africa (9 out of 36 countries)  compared with 95 per cent (36 out of 38 countries) in Europe and Northern America. 
 From 2016 to 2017  ODA for data and statistics rose by 11 per cent  from $623 million to $690 million  but this was only 0.34 per cent of total ODA. International funding for data and statistics is about half the level it needs to be. Over the past three years  countries in sub-Saharan Africa benefited most  receiving $885 million  a significant increase in funding. Continued and increased technical and financial support is needed to ensure that countries in developing regions are better equipped to monitor progress of their national development agendas.
