 Net ODA flows by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development totalled $147.4 billion in 2019. This was almost the same as in 2018  but with an increased share going to the most disadvantaged countries. Net bilateral aid to Africa and to LDCs rose in real terms by 1.3 per cent ($37 billion) and 2.6 per cent ($33 billion)  respectively  from 2018. 
 Concessional finance for the health sector from all donors averaged $26 billion per year in real terms between 2016 and 2018. In 2018  the United States  the Global Fund and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation accounted for more than half of this total  providing $8.6 billion  $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion  respectively. Total ODA for infectious diseases amounted to $6 billion. 
 ODA has long been a source of financing to cushion the immediate impact of crises  and can be an important part of the global response to this pandemic. Nevertheless  the magnitude of the crisis could put pressure on donors aid budgets  despite DAC issuing a statement on 9 April 2020 that members will strive to protect ODA budgets.
