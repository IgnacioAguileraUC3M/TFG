
 During coronavirus lockdowns  many people are forced to rely on the Internet for daily activities  including working from home  taking online classes  shopping and socializing. However  almost half of the worlds population is not connected  particularly in poor countries. At the end of 2019  53.6 per cent of people (4.1 billion) were using the Internet  with wide regional disparities. In 2018  only 20 per cent of the population in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and 26 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa were using the Internet compared with 84 per cent in Europe and Northern America and 87 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. 
 Fixed-broadband subscriptions have nearly doubled over the last decade  from 7.6 per 100 inhabitants in 2010 to 14.9 in 2019. That year  fixed-broadband connections (1.1 billion) outnumbered fixed-telephone connections (931 million). Developed countries had 33.6 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2019  while developing countries had a third of that amount  at 11.2 subscriptions. LDCs had almost no fixedbroadband connections owing to the high cost and lack of infrastructure.
