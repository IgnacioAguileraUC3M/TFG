
 The effective mobilization and use of domestic resources  underscored by the principle of national ownership  is vital to achieving the SDGs. Assessing the tax burdenthat is  revenue in the form of taxesis an important fiscal policy exercise with economic and social implications. The average overall rate of taxation among the Group of 20 and other advanced economies was 23 per cent of GDP in 2017  compared to 18 per cent among developing and emerging market economies.
 On average  in 2017  the share of government expenditure funded by taxes was 64 per cent among the Group of 20 and other advanced economies and 61 per cent among emerging market economies. Globally  the slight reduction in the role of taxes in government spendingfrom an average of 64.5 per cent in 2005 to 62.3 per cent in 2017may be attributable to a combination of improved revenue mobilization and public financial management. 
 A well-functioning revenue mobilization system is a prerequisite for strong  sustained and inclusive economic development. However  countries must custom-build the components of such a system and its overarching fiscal framework.
