A stronger commitment to partnership and cooperation is needed to achieve the SDGs. Attaining the Goals will require coherent policies  an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors  and a reinvigorated Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Towards this end  United Nations Member States have identified the following areas as critical: resource mobilization  technology  capacity-building  trade  policy and institutional coherence  multi-stakeholder partnerships  and data  monitoring and accountability. Meeting the means of implementation targets is key to realizing the Agenda for Sustainable Development  as is the full implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Incremental progress has been made in these areas  but more is needed.
