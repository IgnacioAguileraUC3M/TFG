HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL FORUM GOALS IN FOCUS
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
While primary responsibility for achieving the ambitious Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda rests with individual countries  international support and partnerships are critical  especially for the poorest countries and for countries facing special challenges due to their geographic location. Goal 17 seeks to strengthen global
partnerships to achieve the Agendas goals  bringing together national governments  the international community  civil society  the private sector and other actors.

  Official development assistance dropped slightly in 2017  due to lower costs for refugee assistance
  

      In 2017  net official development assistance (ODA) from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) totalled $146.6 billion. This represents a slight drop (of 0.6 per cent) in real terms from the 2016 level. The decline is mainly attributed to lower spending on refugees inside donor countries: in 2017  DAC countries reportedly spent $14.2 billion  or 9.7 per cent of total ODA  to host refugees in their countries; this represents a drop of 13.6 per cent in real terms compared to 2016. Bilateral ODA from DAC countries to LDCs increased by 4.0 per cent in real terms since 2016.
    

      The United Nations has set a benchmark for ODA contributions of at least 0.7 per cent of a countrys gross national income (GNI). However  only five DAC countriesDenmark  Luxembourg  Norway  Sweden and the United Kingdommet this target. Overall  ODA remained at 0.31 per cent of GNI in 2017. Humanitarian aid totalled $15.5 billion in 2017  an increase of 6.1 per cent in real terms compared to 2016.

      High-speed fixed broadband Internet connection remains largely inaccessible across the developing world
    

      Despite a global rise in subscriptions for high-speed fixed broadband  access to this type of Internet connection remains largely unavailable for residents across the developing world. In 2016  only 6 per cent of the population in these countries had access to high-speed fixed broadband Internet  compared to 24 per cent in the developed regions. Such access can enhance international cooperation  improve access to science  technology and innovation  and facilitate knowledge-sharing. Conversely  limitations in the capacity and speed of fixed-broadband connections affect the quality and functionality of this development tool  widening existing inequalities.
    

  Remittances are a lifeline for families and communities in low- and lower-middle-income countries

      Together  the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI)  ODA and remittances by international migrants to low-income countries grew from $41.2 billion in 2007 to $71.4 billion in 2013  then dropped slightly to $68.5 billion in 2016. Most of the increase is attributed to the steady rise of remittance inflows  from $6.8 billion in 2007 to $19.9 billion in 2016. ODA remained the largest source of external financing for low-income countries  while in lower-middle-income countries  remittances accounted for most (61 per cent) of the external financial flows. Flows to lower-middle-income countries grew from $287.9 billion in 2007 to $452.9 billion in 2015  then dropped slightly to $422.1 billion in 2016.
    

      Despite the upward trend in volume over the last decade  the growth of ODA and FDI has stagnated over the last several years. Compared to the two other types of external finance  personal remittances tend to be a more reliable  less volatile  source of income. In 2016  remittances to low- and lower-middle-income countries were more than three times the amount of ODA and were greater than ODA and FDI combined. Along with FDI and ODA  remittances can ease the credit constraints of poor households  facilitate asset accumulation and business investments  and reduce poverty.

      Market shares of developing regions and LDCs have declined
    

      Stagnation in global trade since 2011 has been accompanied by a break in the expansion of world market shares among developing regions and LDCs. Among developing regions  the share of global merchandise exports declined for two consecutive years: from 45.4 per cent in 2014 to 44.2 per cent in 2016  a sharp contrast to an average annual increase of 1.2 percentage points between 2001 and 2012. Among LDCs  the share of global merchandise exports decreased from 1.1 per cent in 2013 to 0.9 per cent in 2016  compared to a rise from 0.6 per cent to 1.1 per cent between 2000 and 2013. A similar trend was seen for service exports: the LDC share of such exports stood at 0.74 per cent in 2016  a slight drop from the 2013 level. Much of the decline in their share of global exports can be attributed to a drop in commodity prices  since exports from many LDCs are concentrated in primary commodities such as minerals  ores and fuels.

    Tariffs on imports continue to fall for developed and developing countries alike
    

      For all groups of countries  tariffs on imports levied under preferential trade agreements  which include bilateral and regional free-trade agreements  have been declining over time. In 2016  the tradeweighted average preferential tariff rate applied to imports from LDCs was 7.9 per cent  a 2 percentage-point drop from 2005. For developing regions  the average preferential tariff rate in 2016 was 3.9 per cent  a drop of 1.2 percentage points over the same period. Most favoured nation tariff rates  which member countries of the World Trade Organization apply to one another unless they are part of a preferential trade agreement  have also declined for all groups of countries.

          Greater effort is needed to align development cooperation with country-defined development priorities and results  particularly in fragile countries
        

          Development partners need to do more to align their support with governments' national development strategies and results frameworks  particularly in fragile countries  respecting the countrys policy space and leadership in establishing its own path towards sustainable development. Forty fragile countries participated in a global exercise in 2016 to monitor the alignment of development projects to national frameworks and priorities. It found that 82 per cent of new development projects had objectives aligned with national priorities. However  when defining the expected results of these projects  only 58 per cent of results indicators were drawn from country-led results frameworks. More than half of the projects relied on parallel systems and data to monitor progress and development results  instead of integrating these monitoring efforts into existing government systems.

          Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have national statistical plans  but few of them are fully funded
        

          In 2017  102 countries or areas were implementing national statistical plans. Sub-Saharan Africa led this effort among developing regions  with plans in 31 countries under way. However  among 56 countries worldwide with fully funded plans  26 were in Europe and Northern America  and only three were in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing strong  coherent and feasible national statistical plans that have political support has proven effective in building capacity across entire national statistical systems. This allows countries to respond to the growing demand for data while also providing a framework through which to mobilize both national and international resources.
        

          In 2017  71 out of 98 countries for which information was available had national statistical legislation that was compliant with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Out of these 71 countries  34 were in Europe and Northern America. More developing countries will need to put in place solid and politically backed statistical legislation that allows the national statistical system to operate in a transparent and independent manner.
        

          The share of ODA for statistical capacity-building remains low  despite growing demands
        

          In 2015  developing countries received $541 million in financial support from multilateral and bilateral donors for all areas of statistics. Support for statistics in LDCs amounted to $177 million in 2015  compared to $106 million in 2010. Despite growing awareness of the importance of statistics  prompted largely by the SDGs  the share of ODA dedicated to statistics has hovered at around 0.3 per cent since 2010. Continued and increased technical and financial support is needed to ensure that countries in developing regions have the necessary data to fully implement and monitor their national development agendas.

         Censuses and vital statistics are still not universal
        

          Population and housing censuses provide basic information on the size  growth  distribution  location and characteristics of a countrys population. They result in a wide range of statistical information  allowing detailed disaggregation of data needed to formulate  implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the decade from 2008 to 2017  89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.
        

          On the other hand  coverage of birth and death registration and the completeness of vital statistics remains a challenge  even among countries that have functioning civil registration systems. Over the period 2012-2016  143 countries or areas had birth registration data that were at least 90 per cent complete; in sub-Saharan Africa  only 8 out of 53 countries met this standard. Over the same period  148 countries or areas had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete; in sub-Saharan Africa  this was the case in only 9 out of 53 countries.
