          Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have national statistical plans  but few of them are fully funded
        

          In 2017  102 countries or areas were implementing national statistical plans. Sub-Saharan Africa led this effort among developing regions  with plans in 31 countries under way. However  among 56 countries worldwide with fully funded plans  26 were in Europe and Northern America  and only three were in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing strong  coherent and feasible national statistical plans that have political support has proven effective in building capacity across entire national statistical systems. This allows countries to respond to the growing demand for data while also providing a framework through which to mobilize both national and international resources.
        

          In 2017  71 out of 98 countries for which information was available had national statistical legislation that was compliant with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Out of these 71 countries  34 were in Europe and Northern America. More developing countries will need to put in place solid and politically backed statistical legislation that allows the national statistical system to operate in a transparent and independent manner.
