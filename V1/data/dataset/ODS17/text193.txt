
In 2021  net ODA flows by member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) amounted to $177.6 billion  an increase of 3.3 per cent in real terms from 2020. This level of ODA represented 0.33 per cent of donors combined gross national income (GNI)  reaching a new peak. Yet it still fell short of the 0.7 per cent target  and is not enough to enable developing countries to get back on track in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals targets. The increase is mostly due to DAC members support for COVID-19-related activities (including prevention  treatment and care)  with an initial estimate of $18.7 billion. Within this total  ODA for COVID-19 vaccine donations was $6.3 billion (or 3.5 per cent of total net ODA)  amounting to nearly 857 million doses for developing countries.
Since 2015  net ODA has increased by 20 per cent. Despite fiscal pressures in all countries  ODA peaked in 2020 and again in 2021. The ongoing war in Ukraine is having a direct impact on ODA in 2022  due to increased spending on refugees. Military assistance to Ukraine and rising military spending by European nations is not considered ODA.
    
However  it could lead to a sudden reshuffling of budgets and threaten development aid to the worlds poorer countries at a time when it is urgently needed.
