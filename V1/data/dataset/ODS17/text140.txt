Of these countries  54 reported overall progress towards those commitments. For instance  countries reported progress in recording development cooperation on national budgets submitted for parliamentary oversight  and in tracking budget allocations for gender equality and womens empowerment.
        

          Countries own results frameworks were used to identify 83 per cent of new interventions supported by donor countries in 2016. Fifty-seven per cent of results indicators in these new interventions were drawn from country-led results frameworks and about half (51 per cent) used data from national monitoring systems to track results. The extent to which development partners use country-led results frameworks is one indication of the respect accorded to a countrys policy space and its leadership in establishing its own path towards sustainable development.
