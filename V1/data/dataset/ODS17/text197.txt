Global foreign direct investment flows rebounded strongly in 2021  reaching $1.58 trillion  an increase of 64 per cent compared to 2020. Recovery was highly uneven across regions  however. Developed economies saw the biggest rise  with FDI reaching an estimated $746 billion in 2021  more than double the 2020 level. FDI flows in developing economies increased by 30 per cent  to nearly $837 billion. Flows in LDCs saw a more modest growth of 13 per cent.  Inflows to LDCs  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States combined accounted for only 2.5 per cent of the world total in 2021  down from 3.5 per cent in 2020.
International investment in SDG-related sectors in developing countries increased by 70 per cent in 2021.  Most of the growth came from renewable-energy and energy-efficiency projects.  However  the share of total SDG investment in developing countries that went to LDCs decreased from 19 per cent in 2020 to 15 per cent in 2021.

      Remittance flows to poorer countries remain robust  buttressed by strong economic activity and employment levels in many host countries
    
In 2021  remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached $605 billion  a robust growth of 8.6 per cent from 2020. For a second consecutive year  remittance flows to these countries (excluding China) surpassed the sum of FDI and ODA. This significant rise was fuelled primarily by migrants sending money home to families facing economic hardships during the pandemic. Strong economic activity and employment levels in many large host countries that implemented fiscal stimulus programmes aided this growth. The cost of sending money across international borders continued to remain high  at 6.0 per cent on average  double the 3 per cent target.
It is projected that remittance flows will increase by 4.2 per cent to reach $630 billion in 2022  less than half the growth seen in 2021. This decline is a direct impact of the crisis in Ukraine. Remittances to that country are expected to rise by over 20 per cent in 2022. However  many Central Asian countries dependent on the Russian Federation will likely see a decline in remittance flows.
