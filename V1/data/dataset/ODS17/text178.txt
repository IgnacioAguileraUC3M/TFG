 Support for implementing the SDGs has been steady but fragile  with major and persistent challenges. Financial resources remain scarce  trade tensions have been increasing  and crucial data are still lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic is now threatening past achievements  with trade  foreign direct investment and remittances all projected to decline. The pandemic also appears to be accelerating existing trends of global value chain decoupling. One of the few bright spots at this time is the increased use of technology as people flock to the Internet to work  shop and connect with others  but even this draws attention to a still-enormous digital divide. Containing COVID-19 requires the participation of all Governments  the private sector  civil society organizations and ordinary citizens around the world. Strengthening multilateralism and global partnership are more important than ever.
