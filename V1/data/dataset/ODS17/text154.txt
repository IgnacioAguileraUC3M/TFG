          Greater effort is needed to align development cooperation with country-defined development priorities and results  particularly in fragile countries
        

          Development partners need to do more to align their support with governments' national development strategies and results frameworks  particularly in fragile countries  respecting the countrys policy space and leadership in establishing its own path towards sustainable development. Forty fragile countries participated in a global exercise in 2016 to monitor the alignment of development projects to national frameworks and priorities. It found that 82 per cent of new development projects had objectives aligned with national priorities. However  when defining the expected results of these projects  only 58 per cent of results indicators were drawn from country-led results frameworks. More than half of the projects relied on parallel systems and data to monitor progress and development results  instead of integrating these monitoring efforts into existing government systems.
