 Remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are estimated to have reached $554 billion in 2019. Remittances have exceeded official aid by a factor of three since the mid-1990s. In 2019  remittances overtook even foreign direct investment flows to low- and middle-income countries. The growth of remittances slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2019 compared with a robust 8.6 per cent the previous year. 
 Global remittances are projected to decline by about 20 per cent in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown  the steepest decline in recent history. This is largely the result of a fall in the wages and employment of migrant workers  who tend to be more vulnerable than non-migrants in economic crises in host countries. Remittances to low- and middle-income countries  an economic lifeline for many poor households  are projected to fall by 19.7 per cent in 2020  reaching $445 billion. 

Foreign direct investment and global value chains are likely to take a hit from the coronavirus crisis
 Global foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing economies remained stable in 2018. It rose by 2 per cent to $706 billion  but with significant differences among regions. Developing countries in Asia  already the largest recipient region of FDI  registered a rise of 4 per cent to $512 billion in 2018  with growth occurring in all subregions. FDI to Africa expanded by 11 per cent to $46 billion  but was still below the annual average of the last 10 years (about $50 billion). FDI to Latin America and the Caribbean totalled $147 billion in 2018  a 6 per cent drop after an increase in 2017. 
 FDI is expected to decline by up to 40 per cent in 2020 as a result of delayed investment caused by the shock in global demand  and by a further 5 to 10 per cent in 2021. The pandemic has the potential to accelerate existing trends that show a decoupling of global value chains and reshoring  driven by a desire on the part of multinational enterprises to make supply chains more resilient.
