Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

    Achieving the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda requires a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that brings together Governments  civil society  the private sector  the United Nations system and other actors  mobilizing all available resources. Meeting implementation targets  including the raising of necessary funds  is key to realizing the Agenda  as is the full implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Increasing support to developing countries  in particular the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States  is fundamental to equitable progress for all.
  

Official development assistance has continued to grow  though aid to the poorest countries has stagnated

      In 2015  official development assistance (ODA) from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) totalled 131.6 billion US dollars. Taking into account inflation and the rise in the value of the dollar in 2015  this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in 2014  and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from DAC countries as a share of their gross national income (GNI) was 0.30 per cent  on par with 2014. Most of the increase was due to higher expenditures for refugee costs. However  even if those costs are excluded  ODA still rose by 1.7 per cent. In 2015  seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of GNI: Denmark  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden  the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

  Debt service burdens declined substantially from 2000 to 2012

      The ratio of external debt service to exports was below 6 per cent for almost all developing regions in 2012  which represents a substantial  ecline from comparable ratios in 2000. Increased export earnings  enhanced debt management and attractive borrowing conditions in international markets contributed to this improvement. However  for the poorest countries  the most important contributing factor was  outright debt relief: 36 of the 39 countries eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative completed the process and received debt relief of around 136 billion US dollars from official creditors.

High-speed Internet remains out of reach for the vast majority of people living in the least developed countries

      Fixed-broadband connections remain largely unaffordable and unavailable across large swathes of the population in developing regions  highlighting the vast digital divide in access to high-speed  high-capacity Internet services. In 2015  fixed-broadband penetration reached 29 per cent of the population in developed regions  but only 7.1 per cent in developing regions and 0.5 per cent in the least developed countries. Furthermore  while speeds of over 10 megabits per second were common in developed regions  connections in most developing regions did not exceed 2 megabits per second. Similarly  while Internet access has grown substantially over the last decade  only one-third of the population in developing countries and 1 in 10 people in LDCs were online in 2015  compared with about 80 per cent of the population in developed countries. There is also an important gender digital divide: globally  the Internet user penetration rate was about 11 per cent lower for women than for men.

Developing countries share of global exports has increased substantially  but the share of LDC exports remains small

      The share of merchandise exports from the least developed countries in global merchandise exports nearly doubled over the period 2000-2014. Still  it represented only a small fraction of global exports in 2014  at 1.1 per cent. For developing regions more generally   erchandise exports grew by nearly 40 per cent and amounted to almost 45 per cent of global exports in 2014. In comparison  service exports from developing regions lagged behind  accounting for about 30 per cent of total exports. The key driver of export growth during this period was a massive rise in the price of fuel  ores and metals  reflecting a high demand in developing countries  notably China.

      While tariffs on agricultural products from least developed countries have declined  those on clothing and textiles remain high
    

          Average tariffs imposed by developed countries on imports from least developed countries declined steadily for all product groups until 2005. After that year  the average tariff for agricultural products continued to decline  reaching less than 1 per cent in 2014. Tariff rates are still high for clothing and textiles exports from least developed countries due to the exclusion of some large Asian exporters from certain preferential tariffs.

      National statistical plans need to be updated in many countries
    

          A national statistical plan is key to strengthening a nation's statistical system. The requirements of the MDG indicators have gone a long way towards fostering stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions and country groups between 2010 and 2015  including the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. However  many are still without a plan. The overall number of small island developing States with a statistical plan actually declined from nine to seven over this period  as the time period for some existing plans expired.

      In 2013  least developed countries received more than 80 per cent of ODA targeted for capacity-building in statistics
    

          Financial support to build national capacity in statistics amounted to 325 million US dollars in 2013 compared with 379 million US dollars in 2010  a decline of 14 per cent. However  assistance to the least developed countries tripled during this period  reaching 265 million US dollars. This means that 82 per cent of all financial support for statistical capacity-building went to the least developed countries in 2013. South-Eastern Asia  Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa were the biggest beneficiaries of this shift in funding priorities. Despite a growing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence-based policy-making and development  the share of ODA dedicated to statistics  hovered at around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.

      Population and housing censuses are still not conducted in all countries
    

          Population and housing censuses are an important source of disaggregated data needed to formulate  implement and monitor development policies. During the 10-year period from 2006 to 2015  96 per cent of countries in developed regions conducted at least one population and housing census. The share in developing regions as a whole was 88 per cent  dropping to 67 per cent and 69 per cent  respectively  in Southern Asia and Western Asia.

      Death registration  a crucial source of data on health related sustainable development indicators  remains far from universal
    

          Over the period 20102014  death registration data were available for 145 out of 230 countries and territories. Of these  128 had data that were at least 75 per cent complete. Death registration coverage is lowest in Africa and Asia. Information on deaths  especially when it is complete and disaggregated  is key to producing a number of basic health statistics and indicators.
