Timely and high-quality data have proven to be critical in guiding decision-making for development  particularly during the pandemic. In 2021  150 countries and territories reported implementing a national statistical plan  up from 132 in 2020  with 84 of those fully funded. The pandemic has delayed the development of new plans worldwide  meaning that many national statistics offices are implementing expired plans that may not fully cover their evolving development objectives.
A recent survey found that the majority of national statistics offices in low-income countries experienced either moderate or severe delays in budget disbursement in 2021. Many of them relied on development aid from external sources  which has decreased during the pandemic  to implement their work programme. Over the next three years  they expect to face the most significant funding shortages in business and agricultural censuses  as well as population and housing censuses.
Early analysis indicates that ODA for data and statistics amounted to $650 million in 2020  a slight decline from $662 million in 2019. The overall trend in funding for this sector has remained stagnant at 0.3 per cent of total ODA. Moreover  excluding a significant rise in funding for health data  funding received for other statistical activities that are considered fundamental declined by 18 per cent. Funding for data specific to the Sustainable Development Goals  such as gender data and climate data  declined even more than that in 2020.  This indicates that even the most basic data activities were quickly deprioritized at the beginning of the pandemic  leading to serious data gaps and backlogs in countries most in need.
