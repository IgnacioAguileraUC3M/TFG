In 2016  fixed-broadband penetration reached 30 per cent in developed countries  but only 8.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent in developing regions and LDCs  respectively. In the developed regions  about 80 per cent of the population are online  compared to 40 per cent in developing regions and 15 per cent in LDCs. Although Internet use in LDCs has tripled over the last five years  the percentage of users today reaches the level enjoyed by developed countries in 1998. However  the LDC average hides large disparities  with some countries doing much better than others. In 2016  levels of Internet use worldwide were 12 per cent lower for women than for men; the gender gap remains even larger in LDCs at 31 per cent. Both globally and in LDCs  this gender gap has widened in recent years.
