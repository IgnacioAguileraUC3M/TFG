While this represented an increase of nearly 2.9 per cent from 2010  it accounted for only 0.18 per cent of total ODA. The main beneficiaries in 2014 were countries in sub-Saharan Africa (214 million US dollars)  followed by countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (73 million US dollars). Continued effort and financial support are needed to ensure that developing countries have the capacity to better monitor progress on their own national policy objectives and international initiatives. To meet the data needs of the SDGs  developing countries will need an estimated 1 billion US dollars in statistical support annually from domestic and donor sources.
