 Support for implementing the SDGs is gaining momentum  but major challenges remain. A growing share of the global population has access to the Internet  and a Technology Bank for LDCs has been established  yet the digital divide persists. Personal remittances are at an all-time high  but ODA is declining  and private investment flows are often out of sync with sustainable development. Moreover  global growth has slowed due to ongoing trade tensions  and some governments have retreated from multilateral action. With the stakes so high  strong international cooperation is needed now more than ever to ensure that countries have the means to achieve the SDGs.
