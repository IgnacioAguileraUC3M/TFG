Many developing countries are struggling to recover from the pandemic despite a record-high level of official development assistance (ODA) and a strong rebound in global foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittance flows. Among other challenges  developing countries are battling record inflation  rising interest rates and looming debt burdens. With competing priorities and limited fiscal space  many are finding it harder than ever to recover economically. With the pandemic far from over and stark disparities in vaccine distribution among countries  there is also the threat of a two-tiered COVID-19 recovery. To build back better from the pandemic and rescue the Sustainable Development Goals  a full-scale transformation of the international financial and debt architecture will be required. The world is facing a multitude of crises across the social  health  environmental  and peace and security spectrums. To find lasting solutions  international cooperation must be scaled up  urgently. To stay ahead of crises  significantly more investment in data and statistics will be necessary.
