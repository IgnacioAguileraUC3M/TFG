During the period from 2007 to 2016  89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census. Owing to a variety of factors  25 countries or areas failed to conduct a census over the same period. These included financial constraints  technical difficulties encountered in their preparation  natural disasters  and political and social instability. Among these countries or areas  nine were in sub-Saharan Africa and seven were in Northern Africa and Western Asia.
