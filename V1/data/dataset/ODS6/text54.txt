Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

    Sustainable Development Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water  sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources  critical to the survival of people and the planet. The 2030 Agenda recognizes the centrality of water resources to sustainable development  and the vital role that improved drinking water  sanitation and hygiene play in progress in other areas  including health  education and poverty reduction.
  

  A growing number of countries are confronting water stress  which now affects more than 2 billion people worldwide

      Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress  calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable freshwater resources in a particular country or region. Currently  water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the globe  a figure that is projected to rise. Water stress affects countries on every continent  which hinders the sustainability of natural resources  as well as economic and social development. While many regions are below the 25 per cent threshold that marks the beginning stages of physical water stress  huge differences are found within and among countries. In 2011  41 countries experienced water stress  an increase from 36 countries in 1998. Of these  10 countrieson the Arabian Peninsula and in Central Asia and Northern Africawithdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable freshwater resources.

    Over 90 per cent of people worldwide use improved drinking water sources  but not all sources are safely managed
  

        In 2015  6.6 billion people  or 91 per cent of the global population  used an improved drinking water source compared to 82 per cent in 2000. An estimated 663 million people in 2015 were still using unimproved sources or surface water. While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania  widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. Moreover  not all improved water sources are safely managed. In 2012  for example  it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water contaminated with faecal matter.

    Inadequate sanitation facilities are still a reality for one third of the global population
  

        Between 2000 and 2015  the proportion of the global population using improved sanitation increased from 59 per cent to 68 per cent. This means that 4.9 billion people globally were using an improved sanitation facility in 2015. However  2.4 billion did not; among them were 946 million people without any facilities at all  who continued to practise open defecation. The unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to pose a major risk to public health and the environment.

    Plans for the integrated management of water resources are under way in countries in every region  with varying progress on implementation
  

        A key aspect of sustainable water management is the implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)  a follow-up to the 2002 Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. In 2012  65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to an IWRM survey question reported that management plans were in place at the national level  though full implementation varies across regions.
