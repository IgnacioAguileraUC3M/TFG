 The proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 70 per cent in 2015 to 74 per cent in 2020. Still  2 billion people were without such services that year  including 1.2 billion people lacking even a basic level of service. Eight out of 10 people who lack even basic drinking water service live in rural areas  and about half of them live in LDCs. At the current rate of progress  the world will reach 81 per cent coverage by 2030  missing the target and leaving 1.6 billion people without safely managed drinking water supplies. 
From 2015 to 2020  the world population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 47 per cent to 54 per cent. If historical rates of progress continue  the world will reach 67 per cent coverage by 2030  leaving 2.8 billion people without access. Over the same period  the population practising open defecation decreased by a third  from 739 million people to 494 million. The world is on track to eliminate open defecation by 2030.
Frequent and proper hand hygiene is essential to containing COVID-19 and controlling other infectious diseases. Yet  over 1 in 4 people still lack access to handwashing facilities with soap and water at home. Coverage increased from 67 per cent to 71 per cent from 2015 to 2020.
Universal access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene is critical to global health. To reach universal coverage by 2030  current rates of progress would need to increase fourfold. Achieving these targets would save 829 000 lives annually. This is the number of people who currently die each year from diseases directly attributable to unsafe water  inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices.
