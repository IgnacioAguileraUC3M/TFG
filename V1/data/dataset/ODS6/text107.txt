Water-related ecosystems play a fundamental ecological role and provide essential products and services. That said  freshwater ecosystems are changing dramatically. One fifth of the world's river basins are experiencing either rapid increases or decreases in surface water area. Globally  lake water quality is poor: of the 2 300 large lakes assessed in 2019  nearly a quarter recorded high to extreme turbidity (water cloudiness). High turbidity can adversely impact human and ecosystem health. An assessment of 10 per cent of the worlds large lakes in 2019 showed that at least 21 million people  including 5 million children  live within a 5-kilometre radius of lakes with high turbidity.
Natural wetlands around the world are in long-term decline. More than 80 per cent are estimated to have been lost since the pre-industrial era. Between 1970 and 2015  inland and marine/coastal wetlands each shrank by approximately 35 per cent  three times the rate of forest loss. The area covered by coastal mangroves declined globally by 4.9 per cent between 1996 and 2016. Efforts to protect and restore water-related ecosystems must be urgently scaled up and accelerated.
