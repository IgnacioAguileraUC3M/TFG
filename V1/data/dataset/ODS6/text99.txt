Integrated water resources management is a global framework covering policies  institutions  management instruments and financing for the comprehensive and collaborative management of water resources.  Of the 172 countries that reported in 2018  60 per cent stated very low  low or medium-low levels of implementation. These countries are unlikely to meet the target of implementing integrated water resources management by 2030. In 2018  the average global score for integrated water resources management implementation was 49 out of 100. Implementation is particularly slow (very low to medium-low) in around 90 per cent of countries across Latin America and the Caribbean  Central and Southern Asia  and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)  and in 50 per cent to 70 per cent of countries in sub-Saharan Africa  Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  and Northern Africa and Western Asia. An acceleration of progress is needed in these countries  particularly in the area of revenue raising for sustainable financing.
