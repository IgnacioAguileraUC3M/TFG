This means that 4.9 billion people globally were using an improved sanitation facility in 2015. However  2.4 billion did not; among them were 946 million people without any facilities at all  who continued to practise open defecation. The unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to pose a major risk to public health and the environment.
