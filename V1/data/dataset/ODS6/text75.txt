        Northern Africa and Western Asia are hardest hit by water stress  indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity
      

        In 22 countries (mostly in Northern Africa and Western Asia and in Central and Southern Asia)  water stressdefined as the ratio of freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resourcesis above 70 per cent. This indicates a strong probability of future water scarcity. In 15 of these countries  withdrawals totalled more than 100 per cent of the renewable freshwater resources in the country. Such challenges are typically addressed by making use of non-conventional water resources  such as reused wastewater  desalinized water  and drainage water used directly for agriculture. Efforts in countries most affected by water stress need to focus on increasing water use productivity and efficiency through these and other methods.
