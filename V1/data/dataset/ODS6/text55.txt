Currently  water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the globe  a figure that is projected to rise. Water stress affects countries on every continent  which hinders the sustainability of natural resources  as well as economic and social development. While many regions are below the 25 per cent threshold that marks the beginning stages of physical water stress  huge differences are found within and among countries. In 2011  41 countries experienced water stress  an increase from 36 countries in 1998. Of these  10 countrieson the Arabian Peninsula and in Central Asia and Northern Africawithdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable freshwater resources.
