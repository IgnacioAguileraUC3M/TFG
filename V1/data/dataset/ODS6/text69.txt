Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Safe drinking water and sanitation are basic human rights. Access to fresh water  in sufficient quantity and quality  is also a prerequisite to achieving many dimensions of sustainable development  including health  food security and poverty reduction. Water-related ecosystems are essential to life and have always provided natural sites for human settlements  bringing benefits such as transportation  natural purification  irrigation  flood protection and habitats for biodiversity. However 
population growth  agricultural intensification  urbanization and industrial production are beginning to overwhelm and undermine natures ability to fulfil key functions and provide key services. The challenges of meeting future water needs in a sustainable manner are daunting  but they can be overcome. The implementation of integrated water resources management at all levels (including the transboundary level) and mainstreaming water and sanitation into the policies and plans of other sectors are critical.

  A majority of the world's population still lack safe sanitation  and 3 in 10 lack safe drinking water

      In 2015  5.2 billion people (71 per cent of the global population) used safely managed drinking water servicesthat is  an improved water source located on premises  available when needed and free from contamination. An additional 1.3 billion people (17 per cent of the population) used a basic drinking water servicean improved water source not more than 30 minutes away. This means that 844 million people still lacked even a basic level of service.
    

      Based on estimates from 84 countries in 2015  39 per cent of the global population used safely managed sanitation servicesbasic facilities that safely dispose of human waste. An additional 29 per cent of the global population used a basic sanitation servicean improved facility that is not shared. That year  2.3 billion people lacked even a basic level of service  and 892 million people continued to practise open defecation. Only 27 per cent of the population in least developed countries had basic handwashing facilities.

        Conflict  violence and instability are curtailing progress on water and sanitation
      

        Conflict  violence and instability can derail progress towards universal access to basic water and sanitation services. Using the World Banks harmonized classification of fragile states  an estimated 484 million people worldwide lived in fragile situations in 2015. Of these  284 million people lacked basic sanitation services and 183 million lacked basic drinking water services. Globally  people living in fragile states are twice as likely to lack basic sanitation and about four times as likely to lack basic drinking water services as populations in non-fragile situations  with significant differences observed across all regions.

        Accelerated progress is needed in more than 40 countries to end open defecation by 2030
      

        Between 2000 and 2015  the proportion of the global population practising open defecation declined from 20 per cent to 12 per cent. However  faster progress will be needed to end the practice by 2030. Among the 62 countries where at least 5 per cent of the population practised open defecation in 2015  18 countries are currently on track to meet the 2030 target. In another 36 countries  the current rate of progress is too slow to reach the target. For the remaining eight countries  open defecation rates have actually increased since 2000.
      

    Untreated household wastewater poses a risk to both public health and the environment
  

        Untreated wastewater from households degrades overall water quality  posing a risk to public health. It can contaminate drinking water sources and limit opportunities for safe and productive reuse of water. Preliminary estimates from household data in 79 mostly high- and high-middle-income countries (excluding much of Africa and Asia) show that  in 22 countries  less than 50 per cent of all household wastewater flows are safely treated. Of the 59 per cent of wastewater flows that are treated  76 per cent are households with a sewer connection  and 18 per cent are treated through an on-site facility  such as a septic tank.

        Northern Africa and Western Asia are hardest hit by water stress  indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity
      

        In 22 countries (mostly in Northern Africa and Western Asia and in Central and Southern Asia)  water stressdefined as the ratio of freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resourcesis above 70 per cent. This indicates a strong probability of future water scarcity. In 15 of these countries  withdrawals totalled more than 100 per cent of the renewable freshwater resources in the country. Such challenges are typically addressed by making use of non-conventional water resources  such as reused wastewater  desalinized water  and drainage water used directly for agriculture. Efforts in countries most affected by water stress need to focus on increasing water use productivity and efficiency through these and other methods.
      

        Redoubled efforts are needed in most countries to better manage their water resources
      

        Implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) supports the use of water in a way that balances the social  economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. In 2017  157 countries reported average IWRM implementation of 48 per cent  with scores ranging from 10 per cent to 100 per cent. Despite regional differences  each region contains examples of countries with relatively high implementation  showing that the level of development is not necessarily a barrier to implementation. A comparison of surveys conducted in 2007 and 2011 on the implementation of IWRM indicates that modest progress is being made towards the target. However  based on experiences from the field  high rates of implementation typically take at least a decade to be achieved. Most countries need to accelerate current progress to come close to the target by 2030  particularly regarding financing for water resources management.
      

        Cooperation among countries sharing rivers  lakes and aquifers needs to accelerate
      

        A total of 286 transboundary river and lake basins and 592 transboundary aquifers are shared by 153 countries. This reliance on transboundary waters creates interdependencies among countries on political  environmental  economic and security issues  and makes cooperation a necessity. In 2017  based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters  the average percentage of national transboundary basin area covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent. High levels of cooperation exist across Europe and Northern America and for many major river and lake basins in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally  the types of cooperative arrangements vary greatly in terms of their scope  function and form. Most arrangements cover rivers and lakes  but are rarely dedicated to aquifers. It is encouraging that steps are being taken to revise outdated arrangements  strengthen existing forms of cooperation  and negotiate new cooperative agreements. However  a significant effort is needed to ensure that  where appropriate  transboundary basins across the world are covered by operational arrangements.
      

        Lack of abundant surface water in the poorest countries heightens their vulnerability to climate change and water scarcity
      

        Water-related ecosystems are home to diverse plant and animal species  and the source of many sustainable goods and services  including food and water for drinking  energy  agriculture and recreation. Regional trend data show that the extent of surface water increased in some regions from 2001 to 2015. However  this is likely to be largely the result of new reservoir construction  flood irrigation and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change. Globally  slightly more than 2 per cent of land is covered by freshwater bodies  but they are unevenly distributed across countries. Europe and Northern America have almost 4 per cent of their total land covered by freshwater bodies  while coverage in least developed countries and small island developing States is only around 1 per cent. Although landlocked developing countries have a higher proportion of water bodies  this share has declined over the last decade.

        Funding commitments to the water sector dropped by more than 25 per cent from 2012 to 2016
      

        Ensuring water and sanitation for all will require financial resources and technical capacity to support and sustain needed investments in capital infrastructure. While total official development assistance (ODA) committed and disbursed across all sectors steadily increased between 2012 and 2016  the share of ODA commitments to waterrelated activities declined. Such activities include drinking water supply  sanitation and hygiene  agricultural water resources  flood protection and hydroelectric power. Between 2012 and 2016  commitments to the water sector decreased from a peak of $12 billion to $9 billion; however disbursements to water-related activities increased from $7.4 billion to $9 billion. As commitments fall  disbursements may also get smaller in the future. Furthermore  any reduction in external aid is likely to hamper progress towards Goal 6: a 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of countries reported insufficient financing to meet national water  sanitation and hygiene targets.
      

        Over half of countries have policies or procedures for the participation of women in rural water supply
      

        Policies and procedures for participation by local governments in the management of water and sanitation can help ensure that communities are informed  consulted and represented in the delivery of these vital services. Data for 110 countries from two surveysin 2014 and 2017 show that 85 per cent of countries reported that they have policies or procedures in place for the participation of local communities in the management of rural water supply  81 per cent have the same for rural sanitation  and 79 per cent for urban water supply and sanitation. The role of womens participation is increasingly important as a measure of equity. Among the 84 countries participating in the 2017 survey  the number of countries that had policies specifically mentioning womens participation is higher for rural communities than for urban areas.
