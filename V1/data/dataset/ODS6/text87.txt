 Water resources must be carefully managed to ensure sustainability and equitable sharing among users. A global framework for such an approach is known as integrated water resources management (IWRM)  and it covers policies  institutions  management instruments and financing. Of the 172 countries that reported on their implementation of IWRM in 2018  80 per cent had medium-low levels of implementation or higher. That means that they have laid a solid foundation for implementing the many elements of the approach. However  60 per cent of countries were not on track to reach the 2030 target of full implementation. An acceleration of progress is needed  particularly in the area of sustainable financing. In 2018  the average global score for IWRM implementation was 49 out of 100. 
 Community participation is key to ensuring that IWRM is adapted to local contexts. Seventy per cent of countries reported that they had procedures in place (defined in either policy or law) for community participation in the areas of rural drinking water supply and water resources management. However  implementation of those procedures is constrained due to the lack of human and financial resources.
