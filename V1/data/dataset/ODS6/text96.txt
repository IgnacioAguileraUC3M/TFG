High water stress  the withdrawal of too much fresh water from natural sources compared with the fresh water available  can have devastating consequences for the environment and can constrain or reverse sustainable development. If unmitigated  water stress can lead to water scarcity  which could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030. Globally  water stress remains at a safe 17 per cent; however  this overall value masks huge regional variations. Northern Africa and Central and Southern Asia register water stress levels above 70 per cent. Western Asia and Eastern Asia follow  with water stress levels between 45 per cent and 55 per cent  respectively.
Increasing water-use efficiency reduces the risk of water stress  reinforcing both economic and environmental resilience. Globally  water-use efficiency stands at $18.20 per cubic metre in 2017. Estimates ranged from as little as $0.20 per cubic metre in countries whose economies depend largely on agriculture  to $1 197 in highly industrialized  service-based economies. Increasing agricultural water productivity is a key intervention for improving water-use efficiency.
