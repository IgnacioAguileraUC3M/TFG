        A total of 286 transboundary river and lake basins and 592 transboundary aquifers are shared by 153 countries. This reliance on transboundary waters creates interdependencies among countries on political  environmental  economic and security issues  and makes cooperation a necessity. In 2017  based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters  the average percentage of national transboundary basin area covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent. High levels of cooperation exist across Europe and Northern America and for many major river and lake basins in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally  the types of cooperative arrangements vary greatly in terms of their scope  function and form. Most arrangements cover rivers and lakes  but are rarely dedicated to aquifers. It is encouraging that steps are being taken to revise outdated arrangements  strengthen existing forms of cooperation  and negotiate new cooperative agreements. However  a significant effort is needed to ensure that  where appropriate  transboundary basins across the world are covered by operational arrangements.
