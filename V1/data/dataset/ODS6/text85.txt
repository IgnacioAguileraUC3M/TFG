 Between 2000 and 2017  the proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking waterthe highest level of serviceincreased from 61 per cent to 71 per cent. The fastest progress was seen in Central and Southern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean. Overall  90 per cent of the worlds population had at least basic drinking water services. Despite those gains  785 million people still lacked even basic drinking water services in 2017. 
 The proportion of the global population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2017  with Eastern and South-Eastern Asia making the fastest progress. An additional 30 per cent of the global population used basic sanitation services. Despite that progress  an estimated 673 million people (9 per cent of the global population) still practised open defecation in 2017  the majority of them in Southern Asia. Achieving universal access to even basic sanitation services by 2030 will require a doubling of the current annual rate of progress. 
 In 2017  three out of five people worldwide had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water on the premises  compared with less than one out of three (28 per cent) in least developed countries. That means that  globally  an estimated 3 billion people are still unable to properly wash their hands at home. 
 Basic water  sanitation and hygiene services are important not only in homes  but also in public areas where people congregate. In 2016  one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water  sanitation and hygiene services. That adversely affected the education and health of millions of schoolchildren  particularly girls coping with menstruation. One out of four health-care facilities worldwide also lacked basic drinking water services  affecting over 2 billion people and increasing the infection risk of people seeking medical care.
