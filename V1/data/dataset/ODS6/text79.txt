        Ensuring water and sanitation for all will require financial resources and technical capacity to support and sustain needed investments in capital infrastructure. While total official development assistance (ODA) committed and disbursed across all sectors steadily increased between 2012 and 2016  the share of ODA commitments to waterrelated activities declined. Such activities include drinking water supply  sanitation and hygiene  agricultural water resources  flood protection and hydroelectric power. Between 2012 and 2016  commitments to the water sector decreased from a peak of $12 billion to $9 billion; however disbursements to water-related activities increased from $7.4 billion to $9 billion. As commitments fall  disbursements may also get smaller in the future. Furthermore  any reduction in external aid is likely to hamper progress towards Goal 6: a 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of countries reported insufficient financing to meet national water  sanitation and hygiene targets.
