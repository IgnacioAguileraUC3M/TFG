When a country or territory withdraws 25 per cent or more of its renewable freshwater resources  it is water stressed. This challenge affects countries on every continent. In 2018  2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries  of whom 721 million lived in countries with high or critical levels. Between 2015 and 2018  water stress in some subregions with already high or very high levels  such as Northern Africa  Central Asia and Western Asia  increased by over 2 per cent.
Improving water-use efficiency is one key to reducing water stress. Water-use efficiency worldwide rose 10 per cent  from $17.30 per cubic metre in 2015 to $19.00 per cubic metre in 2018. All economic sectors have seen their water-use efficiency improve since 2015  with a 15 per cent increase in industry  8 per cent in agriculture and 8 per cent in the service sector. More concrete measures are needed to save water and increase water-use efficiency  particularly in those regions that have or are close to having a high to critical level of water stress (above 75 per cent).
