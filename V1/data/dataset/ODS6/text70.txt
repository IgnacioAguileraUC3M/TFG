
Safe drinking water and sanitation are basic human rights. Access to fresh water  in sufficient quantity and quality  is also a prerequisite to achieving many dimensions of sustainable development  including health  food security and poverty reduction. Water-related ecosystems are essential to life and have always provided natural sites for human settlements  bringing benefits such as transportation  natural purification  irrigation  flood protection and habitats for biodiversity. However 
population growth  agricultural intensification  urbanization and industrial production are beginning to overwhelm and undermine natures ability to fulfil key functions and provide key services. The challenges of meeting future water needs in a sustainable manner are daunting  but they can be overcome. The implementation of integrated water resources management at all levels (including the transboundary level) and mainstreaming water and sanitation into the policies and plans of other sectors are critical.
