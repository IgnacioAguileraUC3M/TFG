        Between 2000 and 2015  the proportion of the global population practising open defecation declined from 20 per cent to 12 per cent. However  faster progress will be needed to end the practice by 2030. Among the 62 countries where at least 5 per cent of the population practised open defecation in 2015  18 countries are currently on track to meet the 2030 target. In another 36 countries  the current rate of progress is too slow to reach the target. For the remaining eight countries  open defecation rates have actually increased since 2000.
