This new approach reveals that  in 2015  5.2 billion people used a safely managed drinking water service  while 1.3 billion others used a basic service  defined as an improved water source not more than 30 minutes away (round-trip collection time). Another 263 million people spent over 30 minutes collecting water from an improved source and were therefore classified as having a limited service. In most countries  the burden of collecting water falls mainly on women and girls.
    

      The new ladder for global monitoring of sanitation also incorporates a higher level of service that takes into account the disposal and treatment of human waste. In 2015  2.9 billion people used a safely managed sanitation service  defined as a basic facility that safely disposes of human waste. Another 2.1 billion people used a basic servicean improved facility that is not shared. And 600 million people used a limited servicean improved facility shared with other households.
    

    Based on comparable data from 70 countries in 2015  hygiene coverage  defined as the availability of a handwashing facility with soap and water on premises  varied widely across regions. In the 34 sub-Saharan Africa countries with data  less than 20 per cent of the population on average had a facility with soap and water at home in 2015. In the 14 countries with data in Latin America and the Caribbean  hygiene coverage was greater than 75 per cent on average.
