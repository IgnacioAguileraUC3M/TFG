Between 2015 and 2020  the proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 70.2 per cent to 74.3 per cent  with the largest numbers of people gaining access in Central and Southern Asia. Despite this progress  another 2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water in 2020  including 771 million who were without even basic drinking water. Half of those lacking basic drinking water services (387 million) live in sub-Saharan Africa.
The proportion of the global population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 47.1 per cent in 2015 to 54 per cent in 2020. However  3.6 billion people still lacked safely managed sanitation in 2020  including 1.7 billion who were without even basic sanitation. Of these people  494 million practised open defecation  down from 739 million in 2015. While the world is on track to eliminate open defecation by 2030  achieving universal access to safely managed sanitation by 2030 will require a quadrupling of current rates of progress.
The proportion of the global population with basic hygiene rose from 67.3 per cent in 2015 to 70.7 per cent in 2020. This means that  at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  2.3 billion people worldwide (one in three) still lacked a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home  and 670 million had no handwashing facility at all.
Universal access to water  sanitation and hygiene services goes well beyond household use. Globally  only two in three schools had basic drinking water and sanitation services  and three in five schools had basic hygiene services in 2019. This means that 818 million children lacked basic handwashing facilities at their schools at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In least developed countries  only one in two health-care facilities had basic water services  two in five had basic sanitation services  and three in four had basic hygiene services in 2019. To ensure that we build back better from the COVID-19 crisis  Governments will need to accelerate their efforts to ensure access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene for all.
