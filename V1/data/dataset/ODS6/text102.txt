Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Over 100 households and 1 600 schoolchildren now have better access to safe water in South Upi  Maguindanao  Philippines  thanks to a joint project by the International Labour Organization and the Government of Japan.

Billions of people around the globe live without safely managed drinking water  sanitation and hygiene services. COVID-19 has underscored the need for universal access to these services to combat the pandemic and promote a healthy  green and sustainable recovery.  Water is required across all sectors of society to produce food  energy  goods and services. Over the last century  global water use has increased at more than twice the rate of population growth. Many water sources are drying up  becoming more polluted or both. In addition to water stress and water pollution  countries are facing growing challenges linked to degraded water-related ecosystems  water scarcity caused by climate change  underinvestment in water and sanitation  and insufficient cooperation on transboundary waters. The world is not on track to achieve Goal 6. A dramatic acceleration in current rates of progress and integrated and holistic approaches to water management are badly needed.

  Universal access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene is fundamental to the COVID-19 response
Between 2015 and 2020  the proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 70.2 per cent to 74.3 per cent  with the largest numbers of people gaining access in Central and Southern Asia. Despite this progress  another 2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water in 2020  including 771 million who were without even basic drinking water. Half of those lacking basic drinking water services (387 million) live in sub-Saharan Africa.
The proportion of the global population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 47.1 per cent in 2015 to 54 per cent in 2020. However  3.6 billion people still lacked safely managed sanitation in 2020  including 1.7 billion who were without even basic sanitation. Of these people  494 million practised open defecation  down from 739 million in 2015. While the world is on track to eliminate open defecation by 2030  achieving universal access to safely managed sanitation by 2030 will require a quadrupling of current rates of progress.
The proportion of the global population with basic hygiene rose from 67.3 per cent in 2015 to 70.7 per cent in 2020. This means that  at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  2.3 billion people worldwide (one in three) still lacked a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home  and 670 million had no handwashing facility at all.
Universal access to water  sanitation and hygiene services goes well beyond household use. Globally  only two in three schools had basic drinking water and sanitation services  and three in five schools had basic hygiene services in 2019. This means that 818 million children lacked basic handwashing facilities at their schools at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In least developed countries  only one in two health-care facilities had basic water services  two in five had basic sanitation services  and three in four had basic hygiene services in 2019. To ensure that we build back better from the COVID-19 crisis  Governments will need to accelerate their efforts to ensure access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene for all.

      Water stress is getting worse in subregions with already high or critical levels
    
When a country or territory withdraws 25 per cent or more of its renewable freshwater resources  it is water stressed. This challenge affects countries on every continent. In 2018  2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries  of whom 721 million lived in countries with high or critical levels. Between 2015 and 2018  water stress in some subregions with already high or very high levels  such as Northern Africa  Central Asia and Western Asia  increased by over 2 per cent.
Improving water-use efficiency is one key to reducing water stress. Water-use efficiency worldwide rose 10 per cent  from $17.30 per cubic metre in 2015 to $19.00 per cubic metre in 2018. All economic sectors have seen their water-use efficiency improve since 2015  with a 15 per cent increase in industry  8 per cent in agriculture and 8 per cent in the service sector. More concrete measures are needed to save water and increase water-use efficiency  particularly in those regions that have or are close to having a high to critical level of water stress (above 75 per cent).

    Freshwater ecosystems are changing dramatically  signalling the need for an urgent response
  
Water-related ecosystems play a fundamental ecological role and provide essential products and services. That said  freshwater ecosystems are changing dramatically. One fifth of the world's river basins are experiencing either rapid increases or decreases in surface water area. Globally  lake water quality is poor: of the 2 300 large lakes assessed in 2019  nearly a quarter recorded high to extreme turbidity (water cloudiness). High turbidity can adversely impact human and ecosystem health. An assessment of 10 per cent of the worlds large lakes in 2019 showed that at least 21 million people  including 5 million children  live within a 5-kilometre radius of lakes with high turbidity.
Natural wetlands around the world are in long-term decline. More than 80 per cent are estimated to have been lost since the pre-industrial era. Between 1970 and 2015  inland and marine/coastal wetlands each shrank by approximately 35 per cent  three times the rate of forest loss. The area covered by coastal mangroves declined globally by 4.9 per cent between 1996 and 2016. Efforts to protect and restore water-related ecosystems must be urgently scaled up and accelerated.

      Ensuring that operational arrangements cover all transboundary water basins by 2030 will require a major acceleration in effort
    
Transboundary water cooperation is crucial to encouraging regional integration  promoting peace and sustainable development  tackling regional security challenges and supporting climate change adaptation. Globally  153 countries share rivers  lakes and aquifers. However  only 24 countries had all of their transboundary basin area covered by operational arrangements in 2020; 22 countries had more than 70 per cent covered. On average  58 per cent of transboundary basin areas have an operational arrangement for water cooperation. Europe and Northern America and sub-Saharan Africa show the greatest coverage.
In 2020  despite the COVID-19 pandemic  128 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary basins submitted national reports on the status of their cooperative arrangements. More efforts are needed to accelerate progress so that all transboundary rivers  lakes and aquifers are covered by operational agreements by 2030.

  Countries are lagging in the implementation of integrated management of water resources  central to a sustainable future
  
To balance competing demands for water  many countries have strengthened water laws  developed relevant policies and reinforced institutions. Globally  the average implementation rate for the integrated management of water resources increased from 49 per cent in 2017 to 54 per cent in 2020. The current rate of progress needs to double  as 129 countries are not on track to achieve sustainable management of water resources by 2030. To accelerate progress  countries must build on their multi-stakeholder monitoring processes to understand major barriers and identify priority actions. In many countries  COVID19 has actually led to wider stakeholder engagement in water resources management through online consultations. Some of the most common priorities include establishing sustainable financing mechanisms  and improving management and monitoring of basins and aquifers on the basis of hydrological  rather than administrative  boundaries.
