Most countries still lack cooperation agreements on shared water resources  a potential source of conflict 
Transboundary rivers  lakes and aquifers are shared by 153 countries around the world. Ensuring that these waters are managed equitably  sustainably and peacefully  particularly in the context of climate change  requires countries to put in place operational arrangements for water cooperation. According to data collected from 129 countries  32 countries reported that 90 per cent or more of their transboundary water was covered by operational arrangements in 2020  an increase from 22 countries in 2017. In Europe and Northern America  24 out of 42 countries have such levels of coverage  compared to 5 out of 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and a total of three countries across the rest of the world. Accelerating progress will require that countries address data gaps (especially in relation to transboundary aquifers)  scale up capacity development and financing  capitalize on global water conventions and the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers  and mobilize political will.
