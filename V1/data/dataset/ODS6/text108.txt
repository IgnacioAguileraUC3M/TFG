Transboundary water cooperation is crucial to encouraging regional integration  promoting peace and sustainable development  tackling regional security challenges and supporting climate change adaptation. Globally  153 countries share rivers  lakes and aquifers. However  only 24 countries had all of their transboundary basin area covered by operational arrangements in 2020; 22 countries had more than 70 per cent covered. On average  58 per cent of transboundary basin areas have an operational arrangement for water cooperation. Europe and Northern America and sub-Saharan Africa show the greatest coverage.
In 2020  despite the COVID-19 pandemic  128 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary basins submitted national reports on the status of their cooperative arrangements. More efforts are needed to accelerate progress so that all transboundary rivers  lakes and aquifers are covered by operational agreements by 2030.
