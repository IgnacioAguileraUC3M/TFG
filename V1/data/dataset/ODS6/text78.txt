        Water-related ecosystems are home to diverse plant and animal species  and the source of many sustainable goods and services  including food and water for drinking  energy  agriculture and recreation. Regional trend data show that the extent of surface water increased in some regions from 2001 to 2015. However  this is likely to be largely the result of new reservoir construction  flood irrigation and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change. Globally  slightly more than 2 per cent of land is covered by freshwater bodies  but they are unevenly distributed across countries. Europe and Northern America have almost 4 per cent of their total land covered by freshwater bodies  while coverage in least developed countries and small island developing States is only around 1 per cent. Although landlocked developing countries have a higher proportion of water bodies  this share has declined over the last decade.
