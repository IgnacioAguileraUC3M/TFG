ODA disbursements to the water sector reached 8.6 billion US dollars in 2015  representing an increase of 64 per cent in real terms since 2005. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 31 per cent of global water- and sanitation-related ODA disbursements in 2015  more than doubling in the past 10 years. However  since 2005  ODA to the water sector has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total ODA disbursements at about 5 per cent. Countries are making steady progress in achieving increased access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene services. However  critical to achieving Goal 6 by 2030 will be obtaining adequate financial resourceswhether by attracting new sources or better utilizing existing resources.
