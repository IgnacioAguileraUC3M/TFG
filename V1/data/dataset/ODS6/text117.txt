
Water stress occurs when the ratio of freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources is above the 25 per cent threshold. High water stress can have devastating consequences for the environment. It can also curtail or even reverse economic and social development  increasing competition and potential conflict among users. Globally  water stress reached a level of 18.6 per cent in 2019. Although it remained at a safe level (below 25 per cent)  this average masks substantial regional variations. Northern Africa and Western Asia had a critical level of water stress that year  at 84.1 per cent  an increase of 13 per cent since 2015. More than 733 million people - 10 per cent of the global population - live in countries with high and critical levels of water stress (above 75 per cent).
Promoting and improving water-use efficiency relieve water stress. Water-use efficiency improved by 12 per cent from 2015 to 2109 - from $17.4 to $19.4 per cubic metre. But in agriculture  the largest water use sector  it was only $0.63 per cubic metre in 2019. Increasing the productivity of agricultural water is key to improving water-use efficiency  particularly in arid countries reliant on agriculture.
