It can contaminate drinking water sources and limit opportunities for safe and productive reuse of water. Preliminary estimates from household data in 79 mostly high- and high-middle-income countries (excluding much of Africa and Asia) show that  in 22 countries  less than 50 per cent of all household wastewater flows are safely treated. Of the 59 per cent of wastewater flows that are treated  76 per cent are households with a sewer connection  and 18 per cent are treated through an on-site facility  such as a septic tank.
