The proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 per cent in 2000 to 71 per cent in 2017.  Despite progress  2.2 billion people around the world still lacked safely managed drinking water  including 785 million without basic drinking water. The population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2017. However  4.2 billion people worldwide still lacked safely managed sanitation  including 2 billion who were without basic sanitation. Of these  673 million people practised open defecation.
Handwashing is one of the cheapest  easiest and most effective ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But in 2017  only 60 per cent of people had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home.  In LDCs  the share was 28 per cent. This means that  in 2017  an estimated 3 billion people worldwide lacked the ability to safely wash their hands at home. The regional disparities are stark: in sub-Saharan Africa  75 per cent of the population (767 million people) lacked basic handwashing facilities  followed by Central and Southern Asia at 42 per cent (807 million people)  and Northern Africa and Western Asia at 23 per cent (116 million people).
Water  sanitation and hygiene services are not always available in places where people seek medical care: in 2016  one in four health care facilities around the world lacked basic water supplies  one in five had no sanitation services  and two in five had no soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub  at points of care. Moreover  47 per cent of schools worldwide lacked handwashing facilities with soap and water. Closing these gaps will be critical to providing effective health care and to containing the spread of COVID-19.
