 Disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) by donor countries to the water sector increased for several years  reaching nearly $9.1 billion in 2016. However  from 2016 to 2017  ODA disbursements fell by 2 per cent. That drop may be due to donor stocktaking in the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals  and corresponds to a fall in ODA commitments to the water sector between 2012 and 2016 (from $12.5 billion to $9.5 billion). Encouragingly  ODA commitments spiked by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017  indicating a renewed focus by donors on the water sector. That large increase in ODA commitments was attributed mostly to a tripling of commitments to agricultural water resources  prompted by new projects in Southern and South-Eastern Asia. Water supply and sanitation also saw a substantial rise over that period  from $7.6 billion to $9.1 billion  with large increases in ODA committed to water sector policy and administrative management as well as to large water supply and sanitation systems.
