Freshwater ecosystems provide natural sites for human settlements  bringing benefits such as transportation  natural purification  irrigation  flood protection and habitats for biodiversity. However  population growth  agricultural intensification  urbanization and industrial production degrade freshwater bodies worldwide  threatening ecosystems and the livelihoods of people everywhere. Globally  slightly more than 2.1 per cent of land is covered by freshwater bodies  but they are unevenly distributed. In developed countries  3.5 per cent of land is covered by fresh water  compared with 1.4 per cent in developing countries. Least developed countries and small island developing States have a significantly lower coverage of freshwater bodies  at 1.2 per cent and 1 per cent  respectively  which increases their vulnerability to climate change and water scarcity.
