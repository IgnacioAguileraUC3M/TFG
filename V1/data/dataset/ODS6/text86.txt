Two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress  and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Over the last century  global water use has increased at more than twice the rate of population growth. That growth  along with rapid urbanization  socioeconomic development and changing consumption patterns  continues to drive water demand  which is heightened by climate change. By 2030  an estimated 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity.
Currently  one third of countries have medium to high levels of water stress. Countries with high levels of water stress are all located in Northern Africa and Western Asia and in Central and Southern Asia. To reduce pressure on freshwater resources  every country and region needs to increase the use of non-conventional water resources  such as the reuse of wastewater  desalinated water  and direct use of agricultural drainage water.
