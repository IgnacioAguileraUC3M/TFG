        Implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) supports the use of water in a way that balances the social  economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. In 2017  157 countries reported average IWRM implementation of 48 per cent  with scores ranging from 10 per cent to 100 per cent. Despite regional differences  each region contains examples of countries with relatively high implementation  showing that the level of development is not necessarily a barrier to implementation. A comparison of surveys conducted in 2007 and 2011 on the implementation of IWRM indicates that modest progress is being made towards the target. However  based on experiences from the field  high rates of implementation typically take at least a decade to be achieved. Most countries need to accelerate current progress to come close to the target by 2030  particularly regarding financing for water resources management.
