The situation will likely worsen as populations grow and the effects of climate change intensify. Northern Africa and Western Asia  as well as Central and Southern Asia  experience water stress levels above 60 per cent  indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity  particularly in specific sub-regions or seasons of the year. Primary sectors for water use in a country include agriculture  industry and municipalities. Agriculture accounts for almost 70 per cent of global water withdrawals  a figure that rises to 95 per cent in some developing countries. This poses a significant challenge for sustainable development  especially since agricultural production is projected to increase significantly to meet global food needs. Protecting water and using it more efficiently will therefore be critical for producing food as well as in all sectors.
