An estimated 663 million people in 2015 were still using unimproved sources or surface water. While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania  widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. Moreover  not all improved water sources are safely managed. In 2012  for example  it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water contaminated with faecal matter.
