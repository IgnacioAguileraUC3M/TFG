More than 60 per cent of global freshwater flow comes from basins that cross national borders. Transboundary cooperation is a prerequisite for ecologically sound management of freshwater resources and for peaceful regional integration. According to data from 67 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters  the average share of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent over the period 2017-2018. Only 17 countries reported that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. A major effort is needed to ensure that cooperation is operational in all transboundary basins.
