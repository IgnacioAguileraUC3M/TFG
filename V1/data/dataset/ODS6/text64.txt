It contributes to the incidence of diarrhoea and to the spread of intestinal parasites  which makes children more vulnerable to malnutrition. Open defecation can lead to water pollution.
Moreover  it exposes girls and women to the danger of physical attacks. Ending open defecation and achieving universal access to basic sanitation services by 2030 will require a substantial acceleration of progress  particularly in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Nine out of 10 people who practised open defecation in 2015 lived in rural areas.
