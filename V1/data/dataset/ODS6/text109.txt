To balance competing demands for water  many countries have strengthened water laws  developed relevant policies and reinforced institutions. Globally  the average implementation rate for the integrated management of water resources increased from 49 per cent in 2017 to 54 per cent in 2020. The current rate of progress needs to double  as 129 countries are not on track to achieve sustainable management of water resources by 2030. To accelerate progress  countries must build on their multi-stakeholder monitoring processes to understand major barriers and identify priority actions. In many countries  COVID19 has actually led to wider stakeholder engagement in water resources management through online consultations. Some of the most common priorities include establishing sustainable financing mechanisms  and improving management and monitoring of basins and aquifers on the basis of hydrological  rather than administrative  boundaries.
