        Conflict  violence and instability can derail progress towards universal access to basic water and sanitation services. Using the World Banks harmonized classification of fragile states  an estimated 484 million people worldwide lived in fragile situations in 2015. Of these  284 million people lacked basic sanitation services and 183 million lacked basic drinking water services. Globally  people living in fragile states are twice as likely to lack basic sanitation and about four times as likely to lack basic drinking water services as populations in non-fragile situations  with significant differences observed across all regions.
