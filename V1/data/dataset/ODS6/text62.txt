Sustainable water resources are essential to human health  environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. This vital resource is under threat  making it crucial to address the challenges related to water  sanitation and hygiene for populations and water-related ecosystems. Currently  more than 2 billion people are affected by water stress  which will only increase with population growth and the effects of climate change. Achieving universal access to drinking water  sanitation and hygiene and ensuring that services are safely managed remain major challenges  and meeting them are crucial to further progress in health  education and poverty eradication.
