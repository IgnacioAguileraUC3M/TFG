Fresh water is a precious resource that is essential to human health  food and energy security  poverty eradication and many other aspects of sustainable development. Water-related ecosystems have always provided natural sites for human settlements  along with a wealth of ecosystem services. Yet  like other natural resources  water is under threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth  and half the worlds population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa  Asia and Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s. An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the worlds natural wetland area has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation  billions of peoplemostly in rural areasstill lack these basic services. In response  donors increased their aid commitments to the water sector by 37 per cent between 2016 and 2017. Most countries have recognized the importance of better coordinating the use of water resources  and have put in place integrated plans for their management. However  much more effort is needed to improve access to water and sanitation services  increase wastewater treatment  enhance water use efficiency  expand operational cooperation across transboundary water basins  and protect and restore freshwater ecosystems.
