Such policies aim to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation  increase resource efficiency and promote more sustainable lifestyles.
    

      The development of such instruments has intensified through the adoption of Agenda 2030. In 2018  71 countries plus the European Union reported on macroeconomic policies or other regulatory  voluntary or economic instruments that supported the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns across their economies or specific sectors. Taking into account information collected from previous surveys  a total of 108 countries have or had national policies and initiatives relevant to this shift. Europe has taken the lead in that movement  having initiated nearly half of the policy instruments identified  followed by Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.
