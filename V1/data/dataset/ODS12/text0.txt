Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide  and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater appropriated for human use.
The efficient management of our shared natural resources  and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants  are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries  businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important  as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030.
A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving per capita global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy.
Responsible production and consumption is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
