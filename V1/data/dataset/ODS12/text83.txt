These include the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal  the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade  and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Furthermore  the new Minamata Convention on Mercury will enter into force on 16 August 2017. Almost all United Nations Member States are party to at least one of these conventions and 157 of them are party to three.

Under the Rotterdam Convention  there is no such national report requirement.
