
 Shifting to sustainable consumption and production patterns is a prerequisite to addressing global crises  including climate change  biodiversity loss and pollution  and is central to achieving sustainable development. There is a positive trend in the development of national instruments and strategies aimed at supporting this shift. By 2020  83 countries and the European Union reported a total of 700 policies and implementation activities under the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production. However  only 50 policies and implementation activities were reported in sub-Saharan Africa  compared with 374 in Europe and Northern America. 
As of December 2020  40 countries had reported on sustainable public procurement policies or action plans (or equivalent legal dispositions)  which encourage the procurement of environmentally sound  energy-efficient products  and promote more socially responsible purchasing practices and sustainable supply chains.
