
Globally  domestic material consumption per capita  the total amount of materials directly used by an economy to meet its consumption needs  rose by more than 40 per cent from 2000 to 2017  from 8.7 to 12.2 metric tons. All regions except Europe and Northern America and Australia and New Zealand experienced significant increases over the past two decades. Rising domestic material consumption in developing regions is mainly due to industrialization  including the outsourcing of material-intensive production from developed regions. Natural resource use and related benefits  along with environmental impacts  are unevenly distributed across countries and regions. A path for sustainable consumption and production requires circular economy approaches  designed to reduce or eliminate waste and pollution  keep products and materials in use  and regenerate natural systems.
