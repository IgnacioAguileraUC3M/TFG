      Domestic material consumption (DMC) refers to materials extracted within a country for use in production processes. Material footprint  on the other hand  takes into account resources found within a country or imported  and is calculated on the basis of final demand. If the DMC is higher than the material footprint  it indicates that a country is exporting materials  usually minerals or biomass. Conversely  if the DMC is lower  it suggests that materials are being imported.
    

      Over the last two decades  DMC has risen rapidly in developing countries to meet the material needs of a growing population and to support improved standards of living. The data also show that a large gap exists between the DMC and the material footprint of both developed and developing countries  but in opposite directions. This implies that at least some of the materials extracted from developing countries are being used to satisfy the consumption habits of developed countries. Although developed countries have not increased either their total material footprint or their DMC  they have not been able to close the gap between their DMC and material footprint.
