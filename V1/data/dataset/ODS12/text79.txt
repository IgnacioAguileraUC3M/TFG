Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Consumption and production patterns shape resource use management and related social and environmental impacts  thereby affecting sustainability. Sustainable production uses fewer resources for the same value of economic output  and sustainable consumption reduces the need for excessive resource extraction. Over the first decade of this century  however  the material footprint  which measures the amount of raw material extracted to meet consumption demand  increased globally  as did the amount of material used in production processes. Achieving this Goal requires strong national frameworks for sustainable consumption and production that are integrated into national and sectoral plans  along with sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour. Finally  it requires adherence to international norms related to hazardous chemicals and wastes.

The material footprint of a person in developed regions is considerably higher than that of a person in developing regions

    The term  material footprint  refers to the amount of raw materials extracted globally that are used to meet the domestic final consumption demand of a country. It highlights the volume of primary materials required across the entire supply chaindomestic and foreignto meet consumption needs. Globally  the material footprint rose from 48.5 billion metric tons in 2000 to 69.3 billion metric tons in 2010. Two regions accounted for the largest share of this footprint: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (28.6 billion metric tons) and Europe and Northern America (21.9 billion metric tons).
    

    In per capita terms  the global material footprint increased as wellfrom 8 metric tons per capita in 2000 to 10.1 metric tons per capita in 2010. The material footprint per capita increased in almost all regions  meaning that the world now needs more raw materials to satisfy the consumption needs of an individual.
    

    In 2010  Australia and New Zealand had the highest material footprint per capita (34.7 metric tons per person)  while sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest (2.5 metric tons per person). The material footprint per capita of developed regions far exceeds that of the developing regions. In other words  much of the raw material extracted globally goes to serve the consumption needs and habits of individuals in developed regions.

  Most regions have managed to use fewer resources per unit of production

      Domestic material consumption (DMC) refers to the amount of material used in production processes within an economy. DMC per unit of GDP is the amount of resources required to produce a unit of output. From 2000 to 2010  DMC per GDP decreased in all regions except Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  and Northern Africa and Western Asia. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  DMC per unit of GDP increased from 2.0 to 2.7 kilograms over that period. This is mainly due to the global shift in manufacturing to this region and the rapid industrialization that followed. As a result  DMC per unit of GDP increased globally from 1.2 kilograms to 1.3 kilograms. Total DMC also rose over this period  from 48.7 billion metric tons to 71 billion metric tons; Eastern and South-Eastern Asia accounted for 42 per cent of all materials consumed in 2010.

  Many countries still fail to fully meet their reporting commitments under key global environmental agreements on chemical and hazardous waste

      Countries continue to address air  soil and water pollution  and exposure to toxic chemicals  under the auspices of various multilateral agreements. These include the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal  the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade  and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Furthermore  the new Minamata Convention on Mercury will enter into force on 16 August 2017. Almost all United Nations Member States are party to at least one of these conventions and 157 of them are party to three. Under the current conventions obligations  countries are requested to regularly report data and information related to hazardous wastes  persistent organic pollutants and ozone-depleting substances. However  between 2010 and 2014  only 51 per cent of Parties to the Stockholm Convention  57 per cent of Parties to the Basel Convention  and 71 per cent of Parties to the Rotterdam Convention provided the requested data and information. All Parties reported to the Montreal Protocol.

        Transmission rate is defined as the percentage of all commitments fullfilled in transmitting data and information by a Party as required by each agreement. Under the Stockholm Convention  national reports are to be submitted every four years. Under the Basel Convention  national reports are to be submitted annually. Under the Rotterdam Convention  there is no such national report requirement. However  Parties are obliged to submit decisions concerning the future importation of the chemicals listed under the convention.
