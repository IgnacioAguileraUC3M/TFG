Consumption and production patterns shape resource use management and related social and environmental impacts  thereby affecting sustainability. Sustainable production uses fewer resources for the same value of economic output  and sustainable consumption reduces the need for excessive resource extraction. Over the first decade of this century  however  the material footprint  which measures the amount of raw material extracted to meet consumption demand  increased globally  as did the amount of material used in production processes. Achieving this Goal requires strong national frameworks for sustainable consumption and production that are integrated into national and sectoral plans  along with sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour. Finally  it requires adherence to international norms related to hazardous chemicals and wastes.
