Sustainability reporting is an important tool for corporate transparency and accountability  one that plays a key role in attaining the Goals of the 2030 Agenda. While still relatively new  sustainability reporting is gaining momentum  driven by new private sector partnerships to achieve the SDGs along with growing interest from companies (especially large companies)  regulators  investors and other stakeholders. According to a recent report from KPMG  93 per cent of the worlds 250 largest companies (in terms of revenue) are now reporting on sustainability  as are three quarters of the top 100 companies in 49 countries.
    

      That said  more methodological work is required to develop a set of core corporate sustainability indicators and align these with overall SDG monitoring. The main challenges are to integrate environmental  social and governance reporting into existing company financial and non-financial reporting models; facilitate harmonization of sustainability reporting requirements and practices; and assure the comparability and reliability of information and data provided by companies on non-financial issues. Another challenge is the lack of expertise and resources for reporting by small and medium-sized enterprises  which play a key role in some economies  especially in developing countries.
