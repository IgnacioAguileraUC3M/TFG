
Reducing food loss and waste can contribute to environmental sustainability by lowering production costs and increasing the efficiency of food systems. At the same time  it can improve food security and nutrition. While it is not yet possible to estimate the percentage of food waste at the retail and consumption stage  the percentage of food lost after harvesting and during transport  storage and processing stands at 13.8 per cent globally  amounting to over $400 billion a year. Regional estimates suggest that the highest level of food loss occurs in Central and Southern Asia (20.7 per cent)  followed by Europe and Northern America (15.7 per cent). Australia and New Zealand register the lowest food losses (5.8 per cent). Countries need to implement targeted interventions at critical stages of the value chain to reduce unnecessary food loss and waste.
