
In 2019  the world generated 53.6 million metric tons of electronic and electrical equipment waste (e-waste)  an increase of more than 20 per cent since 2014. Each person generated about 7.3 kilograms of e-waste in 2019  of which only 1.7 kilograms was documented to have been managed in an environmentally sustainable way. Improper disposal of e-waste causes poisonous chemicals to be released into the soil and water  putting environmental and human health at risk. It results in a significant loss of scarce and valuable raw materials  such as gold  platinum  cobalt and rare earth elements. As much as 7 per cent of the worlds gold may currently be contained in e-waste. 
E-waste generation is expected to grow by 0.16 kilograms per capita annually  reaching 9.0 kilograms per capita in 2030 (or 74.4 million metric tons in total). However  the realized annual growth rate of e-waste recycling in the past decade was only 0.05 kilograms per capita. It will need to be at least 10 times higher to ensure recycling of all e-waste by 2030.
