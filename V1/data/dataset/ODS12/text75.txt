Domestic material consumption per capita declined slightly in developed regions  from 17.5 metric tons per capita in 2000 to 15.3 metric tons per capita in 2010. However  it remained 72 per cent higher than the value for developing regions  which stood at 8.9 metric tons per capita in 2010. Domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all developing regions over this period  except in sub-Saharan Africa  where it remained relatively stable  and Oceania  where it decreased from 10.7 to 7.7 metric tons per capita. The dramatic rise in the consumption per capita of raw materials in Asia  particularly Eastern Asia  during this period is primarily due to rapid industrialization.

        Note: Domestic material consumption measures the total amount of materials used by an economy. It is defined as the annual quantity of raw materials extracted from the domestic territory  plus all physical imports and minus all physical exports. It includes intermediate and final consumption until released to the environment.
