Fossil fuel subsidies from Governments provide incentives to produce and consume fossil fuels  such as coal  crude oil and natural gas  over the development and use of clean and renewable energy. They contribute to the climate crisis and air pollution  and negatively impact public health. Fossil fuel subsidies saw a decline in 2019 to $432 billion due to lower fuel prices  breaking an upward trend from 2017 ($450 billion) and 2018 ($548 billion). Subsidies were expected to decline sharply in 2020 due to cratering demand and the oil price shock. That drop in fossil fuel subsidies (measured as a proportion of GDP) is likely to be smaller than expected  however  due to a simultaneous decrease in GDP worldwide in 2020. With lower fuel prices over the last two years  many countries took the opportunity to press for reforms and phase out subsidies. However  progress remains uneven. With fuel prices rising sharply in 2021  there is also a danger of regressing and failing to meet the commitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.
