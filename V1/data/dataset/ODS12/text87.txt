How societies use and manage their natural resources fundamentally shapes their quality of life. One of the core objectives of the 2030 Agenda is to decouple economic growth from resource use and environmental degradation  notably through improved resource efficiency  while improving peoples well-being. This can occur through a shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns. Such a shift requires national public policies that create conducive environments  social and physical infrastructure and markets  and a transformation of business practices along global value chains.
