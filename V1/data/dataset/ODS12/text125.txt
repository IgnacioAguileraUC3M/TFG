 The capacity of developing countries to generate electricity from renewable sources has soared over the last decade  from 109.7 watts per capita in 2011 to 245.7 watts per capita in 2020  outpacing population growth. Renewables represent over a third (36.1 per cent) of these countries' total electricity-generating capacity. Despite progress in developing countries overall  LDCs and landlocked developing countries are lagging far behind. From 2015 to 2020  the compound annual growth rate of renewable energy in developing countries was 9.5 per cent versus 5.2 per cent and 2.4 per cent  respectively  for LDCs and landlocked developing countries. At current average annual growth rates  it would take these countries almost 40 years to reach the same level of progress that developing countries achieved in 2020. Targeted action is needed for the deployment of renewables in countries most in need.
