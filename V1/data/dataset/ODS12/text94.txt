 Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future developmentindeed  our very survivaldepends. Globally  we continue to use ever-increasing amounts of natural resources to support our economic activity. The efficiency with which such resources are used remains unchanged at the global level  thus we have not yet seen a decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use. Globally  the generation of waste is mounting. About one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted  most of it in developed countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to over-extraction of resources and further degradation of the environment. Policies must be embraced to improve resource efficiency  reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy. 

Shrinking our material footprint is a global imperative

    Material footprint refers to the total amount of raw materials extracted to meet final consumption demands. It is one indication of the pressures placed on the environment to support economic growth and to satisfy the material needs of people. The global material footprint rose from 43 billion metric tons in 1990 to 54 billion in 2000  and 92 billion in 2017an increase of 70 per cent since 2000  and 113 per cent since 1990. The rate of natural resource extraction has accelerated since 2000. Without concerted political action  it is projected to grow to 190 billion metric tons by 2060. Whats more  the global material footprint is increasing at a faster rate than both population and economic output. In other words  at the global level  there has been no decoupling of material footprint growth from either population growth or GDP growth. It is imperative that we reverse that trend.

  The lifestyles of people in the richest nations are heavily dependent on resources extracted from poorer countries
 The material footprint per capita has also increased at an alarming rate. In 1990  about 8.1 metric tons of natural resources were used to satisfy an individuals needs. In 2017  that rose to 12.2 metric tons  an increase of 50 per cent. That year  high-income countries had the highest material footprint per capita (approximately 27 metric tons per person)  60 per cent higher than the upper-middle-income countries (17 metric tons per person) and more than 13 times the level of low-income countries (2 metric tons per person). The material footprint of high-income countries is greater than their domestic material consumption  indicating that consumption in those countries relies on materials from other countries through international supply chains. On a per-capita basis  high-income countries rely on 9.8 metric tons of primary materials extracted elsewhere in the world.

  Improvements in the efficiency of resource use are not proceeding fast enough

      Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of materials directly used by an economy to meet the demands for goods and services from within and outside a country. At the global level  DMC is equivalent to the material footprint  and reached 92 billion metric tons in 2017. DMC increased from 2010 to 2017 in all regions of the world. Particularly striking is the increase in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  where about 10 billion more metric tons were used in 2017 than in 2010. That increase accounts for about two thirds of the increase at the global level.
    

      The rising share of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and other emerging economies in global DMC is due to two dynamics. The first is the construction of new infrastructure in emerging and transitioning economies  a pattern that many developing countries are likely to follow in the future. The second is the outsourcing of the material- and energy-intensive stages of production from high-income nations to less resource-efficient countries. The shift in production from the former to the latter means that more natural resources are needed to produce the same output.
    

      Because that shift in economic activity happened faster than improvements in resource efficiency in individual countries  material intensitydefined as domestic material consumption per GDPstagnated at an average of 1.16 kilograms per dollar from 2010 to 2017. In 2017  developed countries used about one fifth as many natural resources as developing countries to produce the same amount of economic output. Between 2010 and 2017  material intensity decreased in many regions  showing some progress towards the relative decoupling of economic output and DMC. But material intensity increased in other regions  resulting in no change at the global level. Good progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa  Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)  mostly as a result of increases in GDP.

  Progress in sustainable consumption and production furthers progress in all the SDGs
 The transition towards sustainable and resilient societies will ultimately depend on the responsible management of the planets finite natural resources. Well-designed national policy frameworks and instruments are necessary to enable the fundamental shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In 2018  71 countries and the European Union reported on a total of 303 such policies and instruments.
 A pilot study of 262 reported policies and instruments showed that  while the potential economic benefits of sustainable consumption and production processes are well recognized  social benefits are still largely overlooked. That is  social benefits are rarely included in policy objectives or measured. For instance  63 per cent of the reported policies and instruments examined their impact on air  soil and water pollution  45 per cent on waste reduction and 43 per cent on greenhouse gas emissions. Only 11 per cent considered their impact on health  and 7 per cent looked at their impact on gender. Demonstrating the benefits of such policies to all the SDGs will be essential to understanding the overall contribution of sustainable consumption and production to sustainable development  and to building the coalition needed to support a transformative shift.
