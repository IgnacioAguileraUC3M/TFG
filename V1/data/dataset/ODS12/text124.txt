When electrical and electronic equipment is discarded  it becomes part of a fast-growing waste stream that contains both valuable and hazardous materials. The rapid rise in this e-waste is driven by growing consumption  short product life cycles and minor repairs. In 2019  the amount of e-waste generated globally was 7.3 kilograms per capita  out of which only 1.7 kilograms was managed in an environmentally sound way (meaning that all hazardous substances are dismantled and adequately treated  and recyclable materials are reclaimed). E-waste collection rates are relatively high in high-income countries  but are much lower in low- and middle-income countries - only 1.6 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 1.2 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In low- and middle-income countries  the necessary infrastructure has not yet been developed or is insufficient to manage the e-waste that is locally generated and illegally imported. Moreover  due to the lack of regulations in these countries  e-waste is managed mainly by the informal sector  usually in an unsafe way. Used refrigerants  for example  are emitted in the open air and valuable components are selectively dismantled or extracted by open burning and acid baths  polluting the environment and negatively affecting human health.
