People rely on such materials to meet basic needsfor food  clothing  water  shelter  infrastructure and many other aspects of life. Across much of the developing world  an increase in the material footprint is required to enhance the living standards of growing populations. At the same time  it is important to decrease reliance on raw materials and increase their recycling to reduce environmental pressure and impact.
    

      The per-capita material footprint of developing countries grew from five metric tons in 2000 to nine metric tons in 2017  representing a significant improvement in material standard of living. Most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non-metallic minerals  pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction.
    

      For all types of materials  developed countries have at least double the per-capita footprint of developing countries. In particular  the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries. Because fossil fuels directly impact the environment in various ways  the need to decouple their use from economic growth is key to achieving sustainable consumption and production.
