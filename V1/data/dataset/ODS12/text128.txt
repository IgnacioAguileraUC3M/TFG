 Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production are root causes of the triple planetary crises of climate change  biodiversity loss and pollution. These crises  and related environmental degradation  threaten human well-being and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. If we continue on the prevailing development pathway  the Earth's finite capacity will be unable to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations. Transforming our relationship with nature is key to a sustainable future. As the world develops strategies for sustainable recovery from the pandemic  governments and all citizens should seize the opportunity to work together to improve resource efficiency  reduce waste and pollution  and shape a new circular economy.
