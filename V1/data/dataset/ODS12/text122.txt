
Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of materials directly used by an economy to meet the demands for goods and services from within and outside a country. From 2000 to 2019  total DMC rose by more than 65 per cent globally  amounting to 95.1 billion metric tons in 2019. That translates to 12.3 tons per person. Two regions accounted for about 70 per cent of global DMC: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Europe and Northern America. During this period  Eastern and South-Eastern Asia showed the steepest rise in DMC  from 31 per cent in 2000 to 43 per cent in 2019. The main drivers of this growth are increased population density  industrialization and the outsourcing of material-intensive production from developed to developing countries. Increased dependence on natural resources exacerbates the pressure on sensitive ecosystems and ultimately affects both human health and the economy. Reducing this pressure requires increased resource efficiency  circularity measures and overall efforts to de-materialize economic growth.
