DMC per unit of GDP is the amount of resources required to produce a unit of output. From 2000 to 2010  DMC per GDP decreased in all regions except Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  and Northern Africa and Western Asia. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  DMC per unit of GDP increased from 2.0 to 2.7 kilograms over that period. This is mainly due to the global shift in manufacturing to this region and the rapid industrialization that followed. As a result  DMC per unit of GDP increased globally from 1.2 kilograms to 1.3 kilograms. Total DMC also rose over this period  from 48.7 billion metric tons to 71 billion metric tons; Eastern and South-Eastern Asia accounted for 42 per cent of all materials consumed in 2010.
