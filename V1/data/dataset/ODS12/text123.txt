 As the world faces rising food insecurity  too much food continues to be lost or wasted. In 2020  an estimated 13.3 per cent of the world's food was lost after harvesting and before reaching retail markets. These losses occur during on-farm activities  transport  storage  processing and wholesaling. This share has remained relatively constant since 2016  suggesting no changes in structural patterns of food loss. In addition  an estimated 17 per cent of total food available to consumers (931 million metric tons) is wasted at household  food service and retail levels  translating to 121 kilograms per person each year with about 60 per cent of this waste occurring in households. Food loss and waste are global problems; they happen in all countries  though food losses occur chiefly in developing countries while food waste occurs mostly in developed countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest level of food insecurity  but also the highest rate of food loss. 
 Both food loss and food waste have substantial environmental  social and economic consequences. For example  food that ends up in landfills generates 8 to 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste is one means through which countries can deliver on their Global Methane Pledge. When food is lost or wasted  so are opportunities for improving food security and decreasing the environmental footprint of food production and consumption.
