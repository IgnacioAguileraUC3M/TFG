Globally  new-renewable electricity capacity installations witnessed remarkable development over the past decade  outpacing installations in nonrenewable electricity capacity since 2012 and consistently since 2015. In 2018  for the first time  the majority of new renewable electricity capacity was installed in developing countries. The significant increase in capacity in these countries can be attributed primarily to the uptake of new solar and wind capacity  which increased by a compound annual growth rate of 72 per cent and 22 per cent  respectively  from 2010 to 2019. The most recent data show that renewable energy capacity continued to grow at an even higher level in 2020  despite COVID-19. 
In 2019  developing countries had 219 watts per capita of renewable energy capacity. However  renewable energy capacity was 880 watts per capita in developed countries  four times higher than that of developing countries  suggesting there is still room for growth.
