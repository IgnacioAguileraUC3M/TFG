
 The material footprint per capita has also increased at an alarming rate. In 1990  about 8.1 metric tons of natural resources were used to satisfy an individuals needs. In 2017  that rose to 12.2 metric tons  an increase of 50 per cent. That year  high-income countries had the highest material footprint per capita (approximately 27 metric tons per person)  60 per cent higher than the upper-middle-income countries (17 metric tons per person) and more than 13 times the level of low-income countries (2 metric tons per person). The material footprint of high-income countries is greater than their domestic material consumption  indicating that consumption in those countries relies on materials from other countries through international supply chains. On a per-capita basis  high-income countries rely on 9.8 metric tons of primary materials extracted elsewhere in the world.
