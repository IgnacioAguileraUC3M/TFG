 Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future developmentindeed  our very survivaldepends. Globally  we continue to use ever-increasing amounts of natural resources to support our economic activity. The efficiency with which such resources are used remains unchanged at the global level  thus we have not yet seen a decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use. Globally  the generation of waste is mounting. About one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted  most of it in developed countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to over-extraction of resources and further degradation of the environment. Policies must be embraced to improve resource efficiency  reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy.
