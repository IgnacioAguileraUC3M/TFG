With six exceptions  all Member States of the United Nations are party to at least one of these conventions. The number of parties to these conventions increased significantly from 2005 to 2015  particularly in Africa and Oceania. Currently  there are 183 parties to the Basel convention  180 to the Stockholm convention and 155 to the Rotterdam convention (including the European Union as a party in all three conventions). Becoming a party to these international agreements brings certain obligations  including the establishment of a contact person to transmit relevent communication. All but one of the parties to the Basel convention and the majority of parties to the Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions have designated such contacts. However  the number of countries submitting national progress reports  which are also obligatory under the Basel and Stockholm conventions  has been declining since 20092010.
