It highlights the volume of primary materials required across the entire supply chaindomestic and foreignto meet consumption needs. Globally  the material footprint rose from 48.5 billion metric tons in 2000 to 69.3 billion metric tons in 2010. Two regions accounted for the largest share of this footprint: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (28.6 billion metric tons) and Europe and Northern America (21.9 billion metric tons).
    

    In per capita terms  the global material footprint increased as wellfrom 8 metric tons per capita in 2000 to 10.1 metric tons per capita in 2010. The material footprint per capita increased in almost all regions  meaning that the world now needs more raw materials to satisfy the consumption needs of an individual.
    

    In 2010  Australia and New Zealand had the highest material footprint per capita (34.7 metric tons per person)  while sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest (2.5 metric tons per person). The material footprint per capita of developed regions far exceeds that of the developing regions. In other words  much of the raw material extracted globally goes to serve the consumption needs and habits of individuals in developed regions.

        Note: Rest of the world includes regions whose material footprint is less than 4 billion metric tons each. These regions include Northern Africa and Western Asia  sub-Saharan Africa  Australia and New Zealand  and Oceania*. Because of rounding  numbers in chart may not add up to totals.
