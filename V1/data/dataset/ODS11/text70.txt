As of 2015  142 countries were developing national-level urban policies; of these  82 countries were already in the process of implementation and 23 had reached the monitoring and evaluation stage. The vast majority of these urban policies can further be aligned with SDGs and can be disaggregated by key themes of the sustainability agenda. They are a way to connect national policy to local action.
