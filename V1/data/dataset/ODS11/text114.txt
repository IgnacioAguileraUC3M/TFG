National urban polices are a coherent set of guidelines developed in a collaborative way with all stakeholders that promote transformative  productive  inclusive  equitable and environmentally resilient urban development over the long term. When implemented well  such policies can successfully tackle the multidimensional and far-reaching challenges of urbanization. They do so in part by ensuring sectoral  territorial and jurisdictional integration and coordination.
Countries around the world are increasingly adopting national urban policies. As of March 2021  156 countries had developed such policies. Almost half of these countries were already in the implementation stage  40 per cent were in the early stages of developing policies  and 12 per cent were monitoring and evaluating how well these policies were functioning. The stages of national urban policy development vary by region. In Europe and Northern America  Latin America  and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  at least three quarters of national urban policies are under implementation. Conversely  Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Northern Africa and Western Asia are far behind  with about 60 per cent of urban policies still in the early stages of development  including feasibility  diagnosis and formulation.
With COVID-19 disproportionately affecting urban areas  updates to existing national urban policies are urgently required. The objective is to redesign urban configurations to prepare for  respond to and build resilience to current and future risks.
