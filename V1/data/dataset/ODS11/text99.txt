 The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007  more than half the worlds population has been living in cities  and that share is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030. Cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic growthcontributing about 60 per cent of global GDP. However  they also account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of resource use. Rapid urbanization is resulting in a growing number of slum dwellers  inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services (such as waste collection and water and sanitation systems  roads and transport)  worsening air pollution and unplanned urban sprawl. To respond to those challenges  150 countries have developed national urban plans  with almost half of them in the implementation phase. Ensuring that those plans are well executed will help cities grow in a more sustainable and inclusive manner.
