      Air pollution threatens the health of most city dwellers. In 2016  in all regions except Australia and New Zealand  the annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guidelines of 10 micrograms or less per cubic metre. In the Central and Southern Asia  and the Northern Africa and Western Asia regions  the mean level was more than five times the guideline value. This means that 9 out of 10 people living in urban areas lacked clean air  and more than half of these people were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than the safe threshold of particulate matter concentration. In 2016  an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution. Air pollution does not recognize borders  and improving air quality demands sustained and coordinated government action at all levels.
