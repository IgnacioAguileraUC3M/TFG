 The proportion of the urban population living in slums worldwide declined by 20 per cent between 2000 and 2014 (from 28 per cent to 23 per cent). That positive trend recently reversed course  and the proportion grew to 23.5 per cent in 2018. The absolute number of people living in slums or informal settlements grew to over 1 billion  with 80 per cent attributed to three regions: Eastern and South- Eastern Asia (370 million)  sub-Saharan Africa (238 million) and Central and Southern Asia (227 million). An estimated 3 billion people will require adequate and affordable housing by 2030. 
The growing number of slum dwellers is the result of both urbanization and population growth that are outpacing the construction of new affordable homes. Adequate housing is a human right  and the absence of it negatively affects urban equity and inclusion  health and safety  and livelihood opportunities. Renewed policy attention and increased investments are needed to ensure affordable and adequate housing for all by 2030.
