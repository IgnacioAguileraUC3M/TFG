Air pollution poses a significant threat to human health worldwide. In 2019  ambient air pollution from traffic  industry  power generation  waste burning and residential fuel combustion resulted in 4.2 million deaths. Mortality is attributed to exposure to fine particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) in diameter and other pollutants  which put people at increased risk of stroke  heart disease  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  lung cancer and lower respiratory infections. People with pre-existing chronic diseases have a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Current scientific evidence also suggests that air pollution weakens the immune system against infectious diseases.
Global PM2.5 concentrations have steadily decreased  with an 11 per cent reduction over a decade. More countries now recognize the threat to human health posed by air pollution and the importance of measuring and communicating air-quality levels. A record number of cities (over 6 000) in 117 countries are now monitoring air quality  double the number since 2015. Despite this progress  99 per cent of the worlds urban population live in areas that exceed the new WHO guidelines on air quality  established in 2021  for PM2.5 of less than 5 micrograms per cubic metre (reduced from the 10 microgram limit set in 2005). People in low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by outdoor air pollution  with 91 per cent of the 4.2 million premature deaths.
According to data from 20172019  which measured three-year annual averages  cities in Central and Southern Asia have the worst air pollution in the world  more than two times the global average.
