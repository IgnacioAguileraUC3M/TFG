Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable
As the world becomes increasingly urbanized  many countries face growing numbers of slum dwellers  worsening air quality and insufficient basic urban services and infrastructure. Urban sprawl continues  with the physical expansion of cities increasing at a rate 1.5 times that of population growth  highlighting the need for better urban planning and more efficient transportation systems. To address many of these challenges  152 countries have developed national urban policies that support sustainable urbanization. Although progress is being made  efforts must be redoubled to ensure that all urban inhabitants have access to safe and adequate housing  clean air and basic services  and live in resilient and sustainable communities.

      Urban population growth is outpacing improvements in slum conditions
    

        Over the last 15 years  countries have steadily improved urban slums  managing to move millions of people out of substandard conditions and providing them with adequate housing. As a result  between 2000 and 2014  the proportion of the worlds urban population living in slums declined by 20 per cent (from 28.4 to 22.8 per cent). However  the rate of new home construction lagged far behind the rate of urban population growth  and the number of people living in slums actually increased from 807 million to 883 million over this period. The majority of those living in slums are located in three regions: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (332 million)  Central and Southern Asia (197 million) and sub-Saharan Africa (189 million).

    Managing solid waste remains a major environmental challenge in cities in several regions 

      The safe collection  removal  treatment and disposal of solid waste are among the most critical services in the urban environment. As urban populations grow  income levels rise and economies become more consumer oriented  the volume of solid waste generated will only get larger. Data from 214 cities or municipalities in 103 countries show that about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected. In sub-Saharan Africa  less than half of all municipal solid waste generated is collected  with adverse effects on the health of residents. Moreover  even when waste is collected  it is often not treated and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. Managing such waste continues to be a major challenge facing urban areas in several regions.
    

      Ninety per cent of urban dwellers worldwide are breathing unsafe air  resulting in millions of deaths
    

      Air pollution threatens the health of most city dwellers. In 2016  in all regions except Australia and New Zealand  the annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guidelines of 10 micrograms or less per cubic metre. In the Central and Southern Asia  and the Northern Africa and Western Asia regions  the mean level was more than five times the guideline value. This means that 9 out of 10 people living in urban areas lacked clean air  and more than half of these people were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than the safe threshold of particulate matter concentration. In 2016  an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution. Air pollution does not recognize borders  and improving air quality demands sustained and coordinated government action at all levels.

      More than half of the built-up areas in cities worldwide are public open spaces
    

      Public open spaces in the worlds citiesparks  boulevards  gardens  playgrounds  streetsplay a vital role in social and economic life by providing a place where people can interact. The added benefits of such spaces often include cleaner air and increased walkability  which contribute to physical and mental health. Land use planners recommend that 15 to 20 per cent of urban land be allocated to public spaces (excluding streets) and between 30 and 35 per cent to streets. Data from 231 cities show that 59 per cent of their built-up land consists of urbanized open spaces (approximately half of which is occupied by streets). Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa are the only regions where this proportion is below 50 per cent for the sample of cities included.

      Disaster risk reduction measures are urgently needed to strengthen the resilience of the worlds cities
    

      Reported damage to housing attributed to disasters shows a statistically significant rise from 1990 onwards (even when taking into account the observed high degree of year-to-year variance). Meanwhile  the number of deaths from small- to medium-scale disasters has also demonstrated an upward trend over the same period. Low-income households and small businesses are affected more frequently than middle- and high-income households. This is a result of high exposure to hazards  vulnerable conditions and lower coping capacity. To save lives  prevent and reduce losses  and strengthen the resilience of cities  it is essential to promote public and private investments that take disaster risk reduction into consideration. Many countries have developed measures to reduce disaster risk in vulnerable urban areas  including investments in drainage infrastructure in flood-prone areas  risk-informed urban and land use planning  and appropriate building codes and other regulations.
