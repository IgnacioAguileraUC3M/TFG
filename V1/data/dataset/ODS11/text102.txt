The impacts of COVID-19 are exacerbating the vulnerability of slum dwellers and those living in informal settlements. Many of these urban residents already suffer from inadequate housing with limited or no access to basic infrastructure and services  including water  sanitation and waste management. Overcrowding of public transportation and limited health-care facilities have had a catastrophic effect on these communities  turning them into epicentres within epicentres. Many urban dwellers in the developing world work in the informal sector and are at high risk of losing their livelihoods as cities lock down.
Concerted efforts by national governments  city authorities and other stakeholders led to a significant decline in the proportion of the urban population living in slums  from 28 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2014. Alarmingly  that trend has reversed as rapid urbanization outpaces the development of housing  infrastructure and services. The proportion of the urban population living in slums rose to 24 per cent in 2018  or over 1 billion people  due to increases in Northern Africa and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
