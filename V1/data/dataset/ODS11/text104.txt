How we plan and develop our urban areas  infuse infrastructure and services  mitigate risks and respond to the needs of growing populations determines the long-term prosperity of cities and their people. Over the period 1990 to 2015  most urban areas recorded a general increase in the amount of built-up area per person  that is  the physical expansion of cities was faster than their rates of population growth  according to 2019 data from a representative global sample of 755 cities from 95 countries. In some cities  this rapid expansion reflects unplanned urban sprawl  making the delivery of services more costly and inefficient. On average  all regions except for sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia recorded a consistent increase in the built-up area per capita.
The pandemic has made it clear that urban planning is crucial for better public health and for mitigating peoples vulnerabilities to other hazards  such as natural disasters. As of May 2020  154 countries have some form of national urban plan. Many national and city governments are now revisiting those plans to help prevent the next pandemic.
