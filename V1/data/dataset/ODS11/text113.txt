At the centre of this reconfiguration are open public spaces  particularly streets and recreational areas. Adequate provision of streets  for example  also caters to pedestrians and cyclists and  combined with mixed developments  enhances the use of non-motorized transport. This is not only healthy for residents but can also reduce COVID-19 risks through less congested public transport systems.
The share of the global urban area allocated to streets and open public spaces averages about 16 per cent  according to data from a sample of 911 cities from 114 countries in 2020. This is well below the UN-Habitat recommendation of 30 per cent streets and an additional 10 to 15 per cent open public spaces. The task of doubling the current shares of land to streets and open spaces may be an uphill battle at the start. However  the pandemic has reminded us that such long-term changes and adjustments can reduce risks while promoting healthier  more liveable cities.
