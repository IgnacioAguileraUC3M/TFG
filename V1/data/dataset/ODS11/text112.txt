Poorly planned and managed urbanization translates to a disconnect between the provision of infrastructure and residential concentrations  leading to inadequate networks of streets and a lack of reliable transport systems. This diminishes the potential of cities to leverage economies of scale and agglomeration. Only about half of the worlds population live within 500 metres walking distance of low-capacity transport systems (such as buses or trams) and within 1 000 metres of high-capacity systems (such as trains and ferries)  according to 2019 data from 610 cities in 95 countries.
Access to public transport was significantly disrupted during the pandemic  from partial closures and guidelines on reduced capacities to total network closures. As the pandemic response continues  countries and cities need to provide options for accessible  safe  reliable and sustainable public transport systems. Such systems should be well-integrated with walking and cycling paths through long-term policies  sustainable urban mobility plans and targeted investments.
