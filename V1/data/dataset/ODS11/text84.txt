      Urban population growth is outpacing improvements in slum conditions
    

        Over the last 15 years  countries have steadily improved urban slums  managing to move millions of people out of substandard conditions and providing them with adequate housing. As a result  between 2000 and 2014  the proportion of the worlds urban population living in slums declined by 20 per cent (from 28.4 to 22.8 per cent). However  the rate of new home construction lagged far behind the rate of urban population growth  and the number of people living in slums actually increased from 807 million to 883 million over this period. The majority of those living in slums are located in three regions: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (332 million)  Central and Southern Asia (197 million) and sub-Saharan Africa (189 million).
