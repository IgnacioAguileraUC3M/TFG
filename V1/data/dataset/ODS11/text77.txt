When left uncollected or improperly managed  solid waste can end up blocking drains or festering in open dump sites  resulting in a host of unsanitary conditions. As cities and their populations expand  so does their urban waste  though quantitative estimates remain challenging. According to data from cities in 101 countries from 2009 to 2013  approximately 65 per cent of the population is served by municipal waste collection. The lowest coverage was found in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia  at around 40 per cent. In many cities in these regions  open dumping remains a common practice.
