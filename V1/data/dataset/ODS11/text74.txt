The pace of urban growth has been unprecedented. Around the turn of the century  for the first time in history  urban dwellers outnumbered their rural counterparts  and by 2015  nearly 4 billion people54 per cent of the worlds populationlived in cities. That number is projected to reach 5 billion by 2030. Rapid urbanization brings enormous challenges  including growing numbers of slum dwellers  increased air pollution  inadequate basic services and infrastructure  and unplanned urban sprawlwhich also make cities more vulnerable to disasters. With sound urban planning and management  however  the worlds urban spaces can become inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable  as well as dynamic hubs of innovation and enterprise.
