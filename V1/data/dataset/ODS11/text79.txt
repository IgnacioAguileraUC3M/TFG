As such  these policies have been identified as key to the implementation of the SDGs. With input from regional and local levels  a national urban policy or regional development plan can ensure coordinated efforts among all levels of government and provide the best opportunity for sustainable urbanization. At the same time  these policies and plans promote stronger connections between urban  peri-urban and rural areas by linking sectorial policies that affect national  regional and local governments. As of May 2017  149 countries (or 77 per cent) had fully or partially implemented national-level urban policies  most of which are aligned with priority areas identified in the SDGs.
