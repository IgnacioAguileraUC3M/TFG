Between 2014 and 2018  the proportion of the urban population living in slums worldwide increased from 23 per cent to 24 per cent  translating to over 1 billion slum dwellers. Slum dwellers are most prevalent in three regions: Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (370 million)  sub-Saharan Africa (238 million) and Central and Southern Asia (226 million). The needs and concerns of these people are rarely taken into account in conventional urban planning  financing and policymaking  leaving an enormous segment of the global population behind.
The pandemic has disproportionately affected low-income households and those working in the informal sector. This has further increased the number of slum dwellers and those whose living conditions have deteriorated  making them even more vulnerable. Without concerted action on the part of Governments at all levels  in collaboration with civil society and development partners  the number of slum dwellers will continue to rise in most developing countries.
