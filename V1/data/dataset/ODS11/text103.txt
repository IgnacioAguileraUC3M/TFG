Reliable  accessible and affordable public transportation reduces pollution and traffic and promotes productivity and inclusion. Only half the worlds urban population has convenient access to public transportation  according to 2019 data from 610 cities in 95 countries. Access is measured as the share of the population within 500 metres walking distance of low-capacity transport systems (buses and trams) and 1 000 metres distance to high-capacity systems (trains  subways and ferries). In addition  many cities have a high prevalence of informal transport systems  which are often deficient in terms of regularity and safety. A focus on short-term investments in road-based public transport infrastructure can translate into higher access to low-capacity public transport systems.
While the pandemic is ongoing  cities may need to introduce additional safety measures to mitigate the elevated risk of coronavirus transmission in crowded public transport. Global data illustrate the need to enhance access to public transport systems that are well integrated with walking and cycling paths through long-term mobility plans and targeted investments.
