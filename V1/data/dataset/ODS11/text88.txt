      Reported damage to housing attributed to disasters shows a statistically significant rise from 1990 onwards (even when taking into account the observed high degree of year-to-year variance). Meanwhile  the number of deaths from small- to medium-scale disasters has also demonstrated an upward trend over the same period. Low-income households and small businesses are affected more frequently than middle- and high-income households. This is a result of high exposure to hazards  vulnerable conditions and lower coping capacity. To save lives  prevent and reduce losses  and strengthen the resilience of cities  it is essential to promote public and private investments that take disaster risk reduction into consideration. Many countries have developed measures to reduce disaster risk in vulnerable urban areas  including investments in drainage infrastructure in flood-prone areas  risk-informed urban and land use planning  and appropriate building codes and other regulations.
