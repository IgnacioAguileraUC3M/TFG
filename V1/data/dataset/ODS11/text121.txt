Between 2015 and 2030  annual passenger traffic globally is projected to increase by 50 per cent  and the number of cars on the road is likely to double. Public transportation systems that are well-designed and effective can promote mobility and enable people to access education  health care  employment and markets  while also reducing traffic congestion and pollution. They improve the efficiency  inclusivity and safety of urban areas  while also helping to battle poverty and climate change.
According to 2020 data from 1 510 cities around the world  only about 37 per cent of urban areas are served by public transport. Due to variations in population density within cities  this translates to 52 per cent of the urban population with convenient access to public transport (meaning that they reside within 500 metres walking distance of low-capacity transport systems  such as bus stops or trams  or within 1 000 metres of high-capacity systems  such as trains and ferries). City governments still have a massive task ahead of them in seeking to enhance the availability and use of accessible  inclusive  safe  reliable and efficient public transport systems.
