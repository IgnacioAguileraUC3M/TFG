Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable
The pace of urban growth has been unprecedented. Around the turn of the century  for the first time in history  urban dwellers outnumbered their rural counterparts  and by 2015  nearly 4 billion people54 per cent of the worlds populationlived in cities. That number is projected to reach 5 billion by 2030. Rapid urbanization brings enormous challenges  including growing numbers of slum dwellers  increased air pollution  inadequate basic services and infrastructure  and unplanned urban sprawlwhich also make cities more vulnerable to disasters. With sound urban planning and management  however  the worlds urban spaces can become inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable  as well as dynamic hubs of innovation and enterprise.

The proportion of urban populations living in slums has declined by 20 per cent since 2000  but their numbers continue to grow

      People living in slums  informal settlements or inadequate housing are triply disadvantaged: they tend to be excludedspatially  socially and economicallyfrom the opportunities that other city dwellers enjoy. Over the years  policy and programmatic responses by national and municipal governments  international development partners  and non-governmental and community-based organizations have resulted in improved slum conditions. The proportion of the urban population living in slums worldwide fell from 28 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2014.
    

      Despite these gains  the absolute number of slum dwellers has continued to grow owing to accelerating urbanization  population growth and lack of appropriate land and housing policies. In 2014  an estimated 880 million urban residents lived in slums  compared to 792 million in 2000. Substandard living conditions and the lack of basic services hit children and youth the hardest  diminishing their prospects for good health and education  with potentially lifelong consequences for their cognitive and social development. Slums are most pervasive in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than half (56 per cent) of urban dwellers live in slum conditions.

  The expansion of urban land is outpacing urban population growth

      As larger numbers of people move to urban areas  city boundaries typically expand to accommodate new inhabitants. Understanding the relationship between population shifts and urban land can help policymakers and planners ensure that cities remain economically productive and environmentally sustainable. From 2000 to 2015  in all regions of the world  the expansion of urban land outpaced the growth of urban populationsthat is  the average ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate was greater than one. The ratio increased from 1.22 between 1990 and 2000 to 1.28 between 2000 and 2015. This means that cities are becoming less dense as they grow  with unplanned urban sprawl negatively affecting the sustainability of urban development.

  Municipal waste collection reaches only 65 per cent of urban dwellers worldwide

      Proper management of solid wastethrough waste reduction  reuse  recycling and composting  incineration or disposal in landfillsis a basic component of sustainable cities. When left uncollected or improperly managed  solid waste can end up blocking drains or festering in open dump sites  resulting in a host of unsanitary conditions. As cities and their populations expand  so does their urban waste  though quantitative estimates remain challenging. According to data from cities in 101 countries from 2009 to 2013  approximately 65 per cent of the population is served by municipal waste collection. The lowest coverage was found in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia  at around 40 per cent. In many cities in these regions  open dumping remains a common practice.

  In most cities around the world  polluted air is an unavoidable and major health hazard

      Polluted air threatens the health of most city dwellers around the world. In 2014  nine out of 10 people living in urban areas did not breathe clean air  according to modelled data derived from satellite estimates and ground-level measurements in 3 000 cities in 103 countries. Clean air  in this case  refers to air that meets the annual World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (PM2.5) of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Striking differences are found among regions: in Australia and New Zealand  for example  100 per cent of city dwellers breathed clean air versus 50 per cent and 40 per cent  respectively  of urban populations in Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand  and in Europe and Northern America. In contrast  none of the urban areas in sub-Saharan African countries or in Asian countries met the world air quality guidelines in 2014.

  More than 75 per cent of countries are engaged in coordinated urban planning

      National urban policies provide structure and organization to the often-haphazard process of urbanization. As such  these policies have been identified as key to the implementation of the SDGs. With input from regional and local levels  a national urban policy or regional development plan can ensure coordinated efforts among all levels of government and provide the best opportunity for sustainable urbanization. At the same time  these policies and plans promote stronger connections between urban  peri-urban and rural areas by linking sectorial policies that affect national  regional and local governments. As of May 2017  149 countries (or 77 per cent) had fully or partially implemented national-level urban policies  most of which are aligned with priority areas identified in the SDGs.
