As urbanization increases  the worlds cities and metropolises are struggling to cope with the mounting problem of municipal solid waste. When such waste is not collected and managed responsibly  it can become an incubator for infection and a source of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022  an average of 82 per cent of municipal solid waste globally was being collected and 55 per cent was being managed in controlled facilities. Municipalities in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania have an average collection rate of less than 60 per cent. In Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean  cities have relatively higher collection rates  ranging from 70 to 85 per cent. In Central and Southern Asia  the gap between the collection rate and controlled management rate is larger than in other regions  suggesting that many cities still rely on open dumpsites. Significant investment is needed in the development and maintenance of waste management infrastructure  especially in low- to middle-income countries. This must be accompanied by improved policy interventions and strengthened environmental law enforcement for controlled management of municipal solid waste.
