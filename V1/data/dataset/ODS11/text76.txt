Understanding the relationship between population shifts and urban land can help policymakers and planners ensure that cities remain economically productive and environmentally sustainable. From 2000 to 2015  in all regions of the world  the expansion of urban land outpaced the growth of urban populationsthat is  the average ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate was greater than one. The ratio increased from 1.22 between 1990 and 2000 to 1.28 between 2000 and 2015. This means that cities are becoming less dense as they grow  with unplanned urban sprawl negatively affecting the sustainability of urban development.
