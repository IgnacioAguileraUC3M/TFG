 A connective matrix of streets and public spaces forms the skeleton of the city upon which everything else rests. Where public space is inadequate  poorly designed or privatized  the city becomes increasingly segregated. Investment in networks of streets and open public spaces improves urban productivity  livelihoods and access to markets  jobs and public services  especially in countries where over half of the urban workforce is informal. 
 Based on 2018 data from 220 cities  in 77 countries  few cities have been able to implement a system of open public spaces that covers entire urban areasthat is  within easy reach of all residents. Findings show that the average share of the population within 400 metres walking distance of an open public space is around 31 per cent  with huge variations among cities (from a low of 5 per cent to a high of 90 per cent). A low percentage does not necessarily mean that an inadequate share of land is open public space  but rather that the distribution of such spaces across the city is uneven.
