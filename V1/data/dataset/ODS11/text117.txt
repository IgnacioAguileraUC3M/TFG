Cities in many countries have become epicentres of COVID-19  exposing their vulnerabilities stemming from lack of adequate and affordable housing  insufficient public health systems  and inadequate urban infrastructure such as water  sanitation and waste services  public transport and open public spaces. Deeply rooted inequalities have led to disproportionate pandemic-related impacts on migrants  the homeless  and those living in urban slums and informal settlements. That said  in responding to the crisis  some cities have emerged as engines of economic recovery  centres of innovation and catalysts for social and economic transformation. Recovery from the pandemic offers the opportunity to rethink and reimagine urban areas as hubs of sustainable and inclusive growth.
