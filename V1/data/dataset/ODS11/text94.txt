Moreover  with ever-increasing numbers of people moving to urban areas  the use of public transport is helping to mitigate air pollution and climate change. According to 2018 data from 227 cities  in 78 countries  53 per cent of urban residents had convenient access to public transport (defined as residing within 500 metres walking distance of a bus stop or a low-capacity transport system or within 1 000 metres of a railway and/ or ferry terminal). In most regions  the number of people using public transport rose by nearly 20 per cent between 2001 and 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa lagged behind  with only 18 per cent of its residents having convenient access to public transport. In some regions with low access  informal transport modes are widely available and  in many cases  provide reliable transport. Stronger efforts are needed to ensure that sustainable transport is available to all  particularly to vulnerable populations such as women  children  seniors and persons with disabilities.
