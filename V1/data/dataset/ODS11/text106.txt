In 2016  9 in 10 people living in urban areas worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (PM2.5). That same year  more than half the worlds urban population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above that value. Half the worlds urban population also experienced an increase in particulate matter and a worsening of air quality from 2010 to 2016.
Globally  ambient air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016. In some cities  the lockdowns in response to COVID-19 have significantly lowered certain air pollutants due to the closing of factories and the reduction in the number of cars on the road. However  that improvement is likely to be only a temporary reprieve from a long-term unhealthy situation. Once the lockdowns ease  air pollution will climb back to pre-pandemic levels  as already demonstrated in some countries. It is entirely possible that these levels may worsen due to the relaxation or lifting of environmental laws and standards during the pandemic or during the post-pandemic phase to stimulate economic growth. Together  the United Nations and Governments have a major role to play in ensuring that does not happen.
