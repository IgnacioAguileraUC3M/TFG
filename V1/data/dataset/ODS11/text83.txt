As the world becomes increasingly urbanized  many countries face growing numbers of slum dwellers  worsening air quality and insufficient basic urban services and infrastructure. Urban sprawl continues  with the physical expansion of cities increasing at a rate 1.5 times that of population growth  highlighting the need for better urban planning and more efficient transportation systems. To address many of these challenges  152 countries have developed national urban policies that support sustainable urbanization. Although progress is being made  efforts must be redoubled to ensure that all urban inhabitants have access to safe and adequate housing  clean air and basic services  and live in resilient and sustainable communities.
