With cities on lockdown  open public spaces are even more in demand. As with public transport  equitable access to open and public spaces contributes to enhanced productivity and health. In particular  open spaces as places of commerce are critical to the informal economy  which many people depend on for their livelihoods.
The share of land allocated to streets and open spaces averaged only about 16 per cent globally  according to 2019 data from 610 cities in 95 countries. Of this combined share  streets accounted for about three times as much urban land as open public spaces  such as parks and riverfronts. In terms of access  the share of the population that can access open public spaces (within 400 metres walking distance along a street network) averaged 46.7 per cent. Wide disparities in access are observed across regions  ranging from 26.8 per cent in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia to 78 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. Within countries  smaller cities consistently recorded higher levels of access than large cities.
