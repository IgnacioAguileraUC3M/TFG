Today  more than half the worlds population live in cities. By 2050  an estimated 7 out of 10 people will likely live in urban areas. Cities are drivers of economic growth and contribute more than 80 per cent of global GDP. However  they also account for more than 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. If well-planned and managed  urban development can be sustainable and can generate inclusive prosperity. However  rapid and poorly planned urbanization leads to many challenges  including a shortage of affordable housing  insufficient infrastructure (such as public transportation and basic services)  limited open spaces  unsafe levels of air pollution  and increased climate and disaster risk. The deep inequalities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and other cascading crises further highlight the importance of sustainable urban development. Strengthening the preparedness and resilience of cities  including through high-quality infrastructure and universal access to basic services  is crucial in the recovery phase and in our ability to respond to future crises.
