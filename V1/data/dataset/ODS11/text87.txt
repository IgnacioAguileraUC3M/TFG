The added benefits of such spaces often include cleaner air and increased walkability  which contribute to physical and mental health. Land use planners recommend that 15 to 20 per cent of urban land be allocated to public spaces (excluding streets) and between 30 and 35 per cent to streets. Data from 231 cities show that 59 per cent of their built-up land consists of urbanized open spaces (approximately half of which is occupied by streets). Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa are the only regions where this proportion is below 50 per cent for the sample of cities included.
