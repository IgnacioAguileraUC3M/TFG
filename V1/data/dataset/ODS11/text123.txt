In preparing for a post-COVID world  urban planners are rethinking the link between economic recovery and the equitable distribution of open public spaces. Parks  boulevards and playgrounds  for example  not only enhance the quality of urban life  but are places where people can interact  playing a vital role in social and economic life. Data for 2020 from 962 cities around the world point to poor distribution of such spaces. Only about 37.8 per cent of urban residential neighbourhoods are conveniently located within 400 metres walking distance to an open public space. That translates to about 45.2 per cent of the urban population. As policymakers and city authorities work to redesign and retrofit the spatial configuration of urban areas  it is important to consider the distribution of open public spaces as well as green areas throughout the city.

    More local governments are adopting disaster risk reduction strategies  but a broader disaster and climate risk management approach is now needed
    
The impact of disasters is felt first and foremost by those on the front lines. Thus  local disaster risk reduction strategies are critical. Between 2015 and 2021  the number of countries reporting the existence of such strategies nearly doubled  from 51 to 98. Considering all the countries reporting  the average share of local governments that have adopted such strategies increased from 51 per cent in 2015 to 66 per cent in 2021. Countries have made efforts to align disaster risk reduction  climate change adaptation and development plans at the local level. However  a multi-hazard approach to local resilience-building is essential given the systemic and cascading nature of risk  often fuelled by climate change and  more recently  by the COVID-19 pandemic.
