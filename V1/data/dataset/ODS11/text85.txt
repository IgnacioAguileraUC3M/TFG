    Managing solid waste remains a major environmental challenge in cities in several regions 

      The safe collection  removal  treatment and disposal of solid waste are among the most critical services in the urban environment. As urban populations grow  income levels rise and economies become more consumer oriented  the volume of solid waste generated will only get larger. Data from 214 cities or municipalities in 103 countries show that about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected. In sub-Saharan Africa  less than half of all municipal solid waste generated is collected  with adverse effects on the health of residents. Moreover  even when waste is collected  it is often not treated and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. Managing such waste continues to be a major challenge facing urban areas in several regions.
