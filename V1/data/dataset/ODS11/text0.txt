Make cities inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable
More than half of the worlds population now live in urban areas. By 2050  that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people  two-thirds of humanity. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces.
The rapid growth of cities in the developing world  coupled with increasing rural to urban migration  has led to a boom in mega-cities. In 1990  there were ten mega-cities with 10 million inhabitants or more. In 2014  there are 28 mega-cities  home to a total 453 million people.
Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces  and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas. Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing  and upgrading slum settlements. It also involves investment in public transport  creating green public spaces  and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive.
Sustainable city life is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
