 Nine out of ten urban residents in 2016 were breathing polluted airthat is  air that did not meet the WHO air quality guidelines for annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of 10 micrograms or less per cubic metre. More than half of those people were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above the guideline value. Air quality worsened between 2010 and 2016 for more than 50 per cent of the worlds population. Central and Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are the two regions that saw the largest increases in particulate matter concentrations. 
In low- and middle-income countries  the air quality of 97 per cent of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants did not meet air quality guidelines in 2016  compared to 49 per cent in high-income countries. Ambient air pollution from traffic  industry  power generation  waste burning and residential fuel combustion  combined with household air pollution  poses a major threat to both human health and efforts to curb climate change. More than 90 per cent of air-pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries  mainly in Asia and Africa.
