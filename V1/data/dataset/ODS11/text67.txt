In sub-Saharan Africa  the proportion was 55 per cent  the highest of any region. Though the percentage of the city dwellers living in such conditions declined over the last decade  more than 880 million people around the world were still living in slums in 2014. Concerted action will be needed to address this challenge and enhance resilience because cities remain magnets for people seeking greater opportunities and a better life.
