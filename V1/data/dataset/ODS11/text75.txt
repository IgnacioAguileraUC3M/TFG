Over the years  policy and programmatic responses by national and municipal governments  international development partners  and non-governmental and community-based organizations have resulted in improved slum conditions. The proportion of the urban population living in slums worldwide fell from 28 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2014.
    

      Despite these gains  the absolute number of slum dwellers has continued to grow owing to accelerating urbanization  population growth and lack of appropriate land and housing policies. In 2014  an estimated 880 million urban residents lived in slums  compared to 792 million in 2000. Substandard living conditions and the lack of basic services hit children and youth the hardest  diminishing their prospects for good health and education  with potentially lifelong consequences for their cognitive and social development. Slums are most pervasive in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than half (56 per cent) of urban dwellers live in slum conditions.
