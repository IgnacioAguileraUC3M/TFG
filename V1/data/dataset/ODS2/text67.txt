    By the end of 2016  4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material had been conserved in 602 gene banks across 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres. Over the past 11 years  the rate of increase in gene-bank holdings has slowed. Genetic material from animals has been cryoconserved for 15 per cent of national breed populations  according to information received from 128 countries. However  the stored material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of the national breed population. Therefore  accelerated progress is needed to conserve genetic resources from plants and animals in order to achieve the SDG target.
