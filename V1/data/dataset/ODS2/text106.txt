The world is on the verge of a global food crisis  with a rising number of people experiencing hunger and food insecurity even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Global food supply systems have been partially undermined by a cascading combination of growing conflicts  climate-related shocks and widening inequalities. As a result  as many as 828 million people may have suffered from hunger in 2021. The outbreak of war in Ukraine poses an additional threat to food insecurity  with the potential to provoke a surge in levels of hunger and malnutrition  especially among the poorest and most vulnerable. With this global crisis looming  it is more urgent than ever to address its root causes. The international community must act now to avert a crippling food emergency and the social  economic and political upheaval that could follow.
