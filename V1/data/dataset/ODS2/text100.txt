Just prior to the COVID19 pandemic  650 million people were going hungry  and some 2 billion people were suffering from food insecurity  figures that had been rising since 2014. The crisis has posed additional threats to global food security and nutrition. Disrupted food supply chains and economic slowdowns have affected food systems worldwide and threatened peoples access to food  making the target of ending hunger even more distant. COVID19 is expected to exacerbate all forms of malnutrition  particularly in children  due to a loss of household income  a lack of available and affordable nutritious food  reduced physical activity and disruptions in essential nutrition services. Even discounting the effects of COVID19  around 230 million children suffer from malnutrition. Urgent short-term actions are needed to avert rising hunger  and a transformation of food systems is required to achieve a healthy and sustainable food future for all.
