Small-scale farmers play a critical role in food production worldwide  although they routinely face difficulties accessing land and other productive resources  along with information  financial services  markets and opportunities. Available data show that the share of small-scale producers among all food producers in Africa  Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 per cent to 85 per cent. However  their productivity is systematically lower  on average  than that of larger-scale producers  and in most countries their incomes are less than half of the incomes of their larger counterparts  as shown by data collected from selected countries.
The lockdown measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus have caused businesses and local markets to close  and small-scale food producers are often not allowed to get their products to consumers.
