  Empowering small-scale food producers to participate fully in development is critical to improving food security and reducing poverty and hunger. Many small-scale and family farmers are poor; have limited capacities and resources; face regular food insecurity; and have limited access to markets and services. Both the income and productivity of small-scale food producers are systematically lower than those of their larger counterparts. The share of small-scale producers among all food producers in countries with data in Africa  Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 per cent to 85 per cent  compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe. To strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of small-scale producers  it is important to help them improve their agricultural productivity. Equally important is enabling them to manage their natural resources sustainably; adapt to climate change; and overcome barriers in accessing markets  financial services  information and knowledge.

  Steeply climbing food prices affect countries across several regions

  Weather-induced shocks  civil insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to high food prices in at least two dozen countries worldwide. In 2018 and the first months of 2019  production shortfalls  currency depreciations and insecurity triggered high food prices in several countries in Africa. In Central America  the price of maize climbed steeply in mid-2018  mainly over concerns about the impact of severe dry weather on the main seasons crops. The same occurred in some countries in East and Southern Africa in the first months of 2019. Economic turmoil also drove up food prices in some countries  while low public inventories and increased fuel costs led to record high prices in others.
