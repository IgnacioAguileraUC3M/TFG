Chronic undernutrition puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections  increases the frequency and severity of infections  and contributes to delayed recovery. It is also associated with impaired cognitive ability and reduced school and work performance. Globally  the proportion of stunted children has fallen in all regions except Oceania. Southern Asia made the most progress between 2000 and 2014  but the region is still home to the largest number of stunted children in the world  63.9 million. In sub-Saharan Africa  population growth outpaced progress: the number of stunted children increased from an estimated 50.1 million in 2000 to 57.3 million in 2014. Together  Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of children under 5 affected by stunting in 2014.
