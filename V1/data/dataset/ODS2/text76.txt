
Chronic undernutrition or stuntingdefined as inadequate height for ageputs children at an increased risk of dying from common infections. Stunting is also associated with poor cognitive development  which can have a negative impact on a countrys long-term progress. Since 2000  the proportion of stunted children has been declining; however  149 million children under 5 years of age22 per cent of the global under-5 populationwere still chronically undernourished in 2018. Three quarters of those children live in Southern Asia (39 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent). More intensive efforts are needed to meet the target of bringing the number of stunted children down to 100 million by 2025 and 83 million by 2030. 
In 2018  49 million children under 5 years of age7.3 per cent of the global under-5 populationsuffered from acute undernutrition  or wasting (low weight for height)  a condition generally caused by limited nutrient intake and infection. Over half of children with wasting live in Southern Asia. The global wasting rate in 2018 remained well above the 5 per cent global target for 2025 and the 3 per cent target for 2030.
