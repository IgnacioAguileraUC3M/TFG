
Childhood overweight and wasting form the double burden of malnutrition. Children who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of early-onset obesity-related health and psychological complications. They often carry the extra weight into adolescence and adulthood  leading to lifelong health problems. The prevalence of overweight is increasing in all age groups. In 2018  childhood overweight affected 40 million children under 5 years of age5.9 per cent of the global under-5 population. Prevalence levels were above 9 per cent in Northern Africa  Southern Africa  Central Asia  Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Western Asia.
Globally  in 2016  overweight affected 20.6 per cent of children 5 to 9 years old (131 million)  17.3 per cent of adolescents (207 million) and 38.9 per cent of adults (2 billion). The promotion of healthy diets is central to halting and reversing the obesity epidemic. Governments have a range of policy options to choose from to improve access to healthy and affordable diets  from hard policies  such as bans and regulations  to soft policies  that entail lower degrees of intervention in peoples lives  such as the provision of information.
