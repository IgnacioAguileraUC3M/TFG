
Chronic undernutrition  or stunting  puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections; it is also associated with poor cognitive development. The proportion of children under 5 years of age suffering from stunting decreased from 32 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2015 and 21 per cent in 2019. However  144 million children under age 5 were still affected by stunting in 2019. Three quarters of these children lived in just two regions: Southern Asia (39 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent). More intensive efforts are needed to achieve the global target of bringing down the number of stunted children to 99 million by 2025 and to 82 million by 2030.
In 2019  6.9 per cent (or 47 million) children under 5 were affected by wasting  or acute undernutrition  a condition caused by limited nutrient intake and infection. This is well above the 5 per cent global target for 2025  and the 3 per cent global target for 2030. More than half of the children suffering from wasting live in Central and Southern Asia  the only region with a prevalence of more than 10 per cent. 
The growth and development of these children are at higher risk during the current crisis due to constrained access to nutritious diets and essential nutrition services.
