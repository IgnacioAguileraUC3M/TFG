  Anaemia is a condition in which the concentration of haemoglobin is insufficient to meet the bodys physiologic needs. In pregnant women  it increases the risk of adverse outcomes for both mother and baby. It may also be an independent risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19. In 2019  the global prevalence of anaemia was 29.9 per cent in women of reproductive age (over half a billion women)  29.6 per cent in non-pregnant women and 36.5 per cent in pregnant women. Almost half of women aged 15 to 49 in Central and Southern Asia suffer from anaemia. Since 2000  the prevalence of this condition globally in women of reproductive age has been stagnant. The disruption of health services and food systems  coupled with economic downturns caused by the pandemic  may worsen prevalence. Multisectoral efforts and interventions are needed to optimize anaemia-reduction efforts and close the gaps in achieving the global target of reducing anaemia in women of reproductive age by 50 per cent by 2030.
