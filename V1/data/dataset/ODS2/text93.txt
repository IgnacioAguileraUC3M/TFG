COVID-19 has had a further and profound impact on hunger and food security  triggered by disruptions in food supply chains  income losses  widening social inequities  an altered food environment and price hikes. Between 720 and 811 million people in the world faced hunger in 2020  an increase of as many as 161 million from 2019.
The prevalence of undernourishment increased from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.9 per cent in 2020. Hunger affects 21.0 per cent of the population in Africa  compared with 9.0 per cent in Asia and 9.1 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than half of the worlds undernourished are found in Asia (418 million) and more than one-third in Africa (282 million).
Achieving food security goes beyond the eradication of hunger. Nearly one in three people in the world (2.37 billion) were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2020  an increase of almost 320 million from 2019. Such levels indicate that people are unable to eat a healthy  balanced diet on a regular basis  or that they run out of food and  at worst  go a day or days without eating. The highest levels of food insecurity were found in sub-Saharan Africa (66.2 per cent)  while prevalence rose fastest in Latin America and Caribbean  from 24.9 per cent in 2014 to 40.9 per cent in 2020. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity being 10 per cent higher among women than men in 2020  compared with 6 per cent in 2019.
