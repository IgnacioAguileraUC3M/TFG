Far too many children under age 5 are stunted  wasted or overweightall of which are manifestations of malnutrition.These conditions put children at greater risk of dying from common infections  jeopardize their cognitive development and increase their vulnerability to non-communicable diseases later in life.
In 2016  an estimated 155 million children under age 5 were stunted (low height for their age)  down from 198 million in 2000. Globally  the stunting rate fell from 32.7 per cent in 2000 to 22.9 per cent in 2016. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of children under age 5 with stunted growth in 2016.
In 2016  an estimated 52 million children under age 5 worldwide suffered from wasting (low weight for their height). The global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent  with the highest rate (14.9 per cent) in Central and Southern Asia. More than half of all children (27.6 million) suffering from wasting lived in Southern Asia. At the other end of the malnutrition spectrum is being overweight  which is increasing in many regions.  The number of overweight children under age 5 worldwide increased from 30 million (5 per cent) in 2000 to 41 million (6 per cent) in 2016. The highest rates of overweight children under age 5 in 2016 were seen in Oceania (9.6 per cent)  Northern Africa and Western Asia (9.0 per cent)  and Northern America (7.8 per cent).
