
Good nutrition sets children on a path to survive and thrive. The full impact of the pandemic on child nutrition may take years to manifest. However  a likely scenario is that COVID-19  together with soaring food prices  are exacerbating all forms of malnutrition due to a loss of household income  the lack of available and affordable nutritious food  reduced physical activity and disruptions in essential nutrition services.
In 2020  the latest year for which data are available  22.0 per cent of children under age 5 worldwide (149.2 million) suffered from stunting (low height for age).1  This is a decline from 24.4 per cent in 2015. Subsequent years have seen continued constraints in accessing nutritious food and essential nutrition services due to the pandemic. To achieve the target of a 50 per cent reduction in the number of stunted children by 2030  the annual rate of decline must double (to 3.9 per cent per year) from its current annual reduction rate of 2.1 per cent per year. 
Childhood wasting and overweight are both forms of malnutrition and can coexist in a population. In 2020  wasting (low weight for height) and overweight were found in 6.7 per cent of children under 5 (45.4 million) and 5.7 per cent of children under 5 (38.9 million)  respectively. Wasting is a condition that can be brought on rapidly as a result of conflict  pandemics and climate events. Related shocks in food  fuel and fertilizer prices stemming from the war in Ukraine could tip the balance even further  destroying access to healthy diets. Childhood overweight may also be on the rise in some countries where unhealthy food replaced fresh  nutritious food  and movement restrictions curtailed opportunities for physical activity for long periods of time.
Such shocks  which have been occurring since 2020  will reverse progress made to date without additional interventions. An intensification of efforts is urgently required to reduce malnutrition and address the growing threats to nutrition security.

          * Excluding Australia and New Zealand.
          ** Excluding Japan for the wasting estimate. 
          *** The wasting estimate represents Northern America since population coverage for Europe was insufficient (<50 per cent). 
          **** Wasting estimates are not available due to insufficient (< 50 per cent) population coverage.
        
1  Estimates for 2020 do not account for the full impact of COVID-19 since the collection of household survey data on child height and weight were limited in 2020 due to pandemic-related physical distancing measures.
