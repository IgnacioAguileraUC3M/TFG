Eradicating hunger and achieving food security remains a challenge  more so in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. At the global level  hunger and food insecurity have been on the rise  and malnutrition still affects millions of children. The situation is likely to get worse owing to economic slowdowns and disruptions caused by a pandemic-triggered recession. In addition to COVID-19  the desert locust upsurge in six Eastern African countries and Yemen  where 35 million people are already experiencing acute food insecurity  remains alarming. To mitigate the threats posed by the pandemic to vulnerable populations  countries need to take immediate action to keep trade flowing  to strengthen food supply chains and to increase agricultural production.
