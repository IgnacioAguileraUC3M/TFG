The share of countries affected by high food prices  which had been relatively stable since 2016  has risen sharply  climbing from 16 per cent in 2019 to 47 per cent in 2020. This shift mainly reflects trends in international markets. International prices of food items soared in the second half of 2020  more than offsetting declines in the first five months of the year. The price rises were partly due to an increase in international demand for cereals  vegetable oils  sugar and dairy products as restrictive COVID-19-related measures eased. In domestic markets  increasing freight and agricultural input costs  as well as logistical bottlenecks and market uncertainties  put increased pressure on food prices. 
Prior to the Ukraine crisis  international food prices were already high  owing to market conditions  high energy and fertilizer prices  and other factors. In March 2022  global food prices were almost 30 per cent higher than at the same time last year  reaching an all-time high  though prices eased somewhat in the subsequent two months. Soaring food prices threaten to exacerbate global food insecurity.
