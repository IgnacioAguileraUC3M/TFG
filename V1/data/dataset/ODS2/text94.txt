Small-scale food producers constitute the majority of food producers in the 37 countries surveyed; in some countries  they account for up to 91 per cent. Strengthening the resilience and adaptability of these small farmers is critical to reversing the trend towards rising hunger and reducing the share of people living in extreme poverty. Data from 11 countries show that the average labour productivity of small-scale food producers is lower than that of large-scale producers. Moreover  large-scale producers earn two to three times the annual income of small farmers.  In almost all countries surveyed  households headed by men achieve higher labour productivity and earn a larger annual income than those headed by women. For example  in Bangladesh  households headed by women earn on average only half of the agricultural income of households headed by men  whereas in Bulgaria  the difference is threefold.
