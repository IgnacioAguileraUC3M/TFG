In 2020 1 wasting affected an estimated 45.4 million children under age 5 (6.7 per cent); overweight affected 38.9 million children in the same age group (5.7 per cent). Wasting will be one of the conditions most affected by COVID-19 in the short term. Around 15 per cent more children than estimated may have suffered from wasting in 2020  due to deterioration in household wealth and disruptions in the availability and affordability of nutritious food and essential nutrition services.

  Overweight in children may also rise in some countries where unhealthy food replaced fresh  nutritious food  and movement restrictions limited opportunities for physical activity for long periods of time. Childhood wasting and overweight coexist in many developing regions at alarmingly high levels. For example  in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)  wasting prevalence was 9.0 per cent while overweight prevalence was 8.0 per cent.
