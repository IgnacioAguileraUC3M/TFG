Despite earlier extended progress  the number of people suffering from hunger has been on the rise since 2014. Stunting affects the growth and cognitive development of millions of children  while the prevalence of overweightthe other face of malnutrition is increasing in all age groups. In the wake of conflicts  climate-induced shocks and economic slowdowns worldwide  intensified efforts are needed to implement and scale up interventions to improve access to safe  nutritious and sufficient food for all. Specifically  attention needs to be given to increasing the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers  implementing resilient agricultural practices  and ensuring the proper functioning of markets. Finally  in ensuring that no one is left behind on the road towards zero hunger  the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition must be broken.

  After extended progress  the number of people suffering from hunger is on the rise

    The number of people going hungry has increased since 2014a worrisome trend. An estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017  the same number as in 2010. The prevalence of undernourishment has remained virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level slightly below 11 per cent. Updated figures on undernourishment  food insecurity and malnutrition will be released in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019 (July 2019).
The situation deteriorated significantly in sub-Saharan Africa  where the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in 2014 to 237 million in 2017. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of hunger  with the rate increasing from 20.7 per cent in 2014 to 23.2 per cent in 2017. In South America  the situation also appears to be worsening. This may be the result of an economic slowdown  which reduced fiscal capacity to protect the most vulnerable against rising domestic prices and loss of income. Adverse weather conditions affecting food availability and prices  and prolonged armed conflicts  are among the key drivers of these trends.

  Stunting and wasting in children are declining  but not fast enough to meet SDG targets
Chronic undernutrition or stuntingdefined as inadequate height for ageputs children at an increased risk of dying from common infections. Stunting is also associated with poor cognitive development  which can have a negative impact on a countrys long-term progress. Since 2000  the proportion of stunted children has been declining; however  149 million children under 5 years of age22 per cent of the global under-5 populationwere still chronically undernourished in 2018. Three quarters of those children live in Southern Asia (39 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent). More intensive efforts are needed to meet the target of bringing the number of stunted children down to 100 million by 2025 and 83 million by 2030. 
In 2018  49 million children under 5 years of age7.3 per cent of the global under-5 populationsuffered from acute undernutrition  or wasting (low weight for height)  a condition generally caused by limited nutrient intake and infection. Over half of children with wasting live in Southern Asia. The global wasting rate in 2018 remained well above the 5 per cent global target for 2025 and the 3 per cent target for 2030.

  The prevalence of overweight  another form of malnutrition  is increasing in all age groups
Childhood overweight and wasting form the double burden of malnutrition. Children who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of early-onset obesity-related health and psychological complications. They often carry the extra weight into adolescence and adulthood  leading to lifelong health problems. The prevalence of overweight is increasing in all age groups. In 2018  childhood overweight affected 40 million children under 5 years of age5.9 per cent of the global under-5 population. Prevalence levels were above 9 per cent in Northern Africa  Southern Africa  Central Asia  Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Western Asia.
Globally  in 2016  overweight affected 20.6 per cent of children 5 to 9 years old (131 million)  17.3 per cent of adolescents (207 million) and 38.9 per cent of adults (2 billion). The promotion of healthy diets is central to halting and reversing the obesity epidemic. Governments have a range of policy options to choose from to improve access to healthy and affordable diets  from hard policies  such as bans and regulations  to soft policies  that entail lower degrees of intervention in peoples lives  such as the provision of information.

  Small-scale food producers are a big part of the solution to world hunger

  Empowering small-scale food producers to participate fully in development is critical to improving food security and reducing poverty and hunger. Many small-scale and family farmers are poor; have limited capacities and resources; face regular food insecurity; and have limited access to markets and services. Both the income and productivity of small-scale food producers are systematically lower than those of their larger counterparts. The share of small-scale producers among all food producers in countries with data in Africa  Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 per cent to 85 per cent  compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe. To strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of small-scale producers  it is important to help them improve their agricultural productivity. Equally important is enabling them to manage their natural resources sustainably; adapt to climate change; and overcome barriers in accessing markets  financial services  information and knowledge.

  Steeply climbing food prices affect countries across several regions

  Weather-induced shocks  civil insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to high food prices in at least two dozen countries worldwide. In 2018 and the first months of 2019  production shortfalls  currency depreciations and insecurity triggered high food prices in several countries in Africa. In Central America  the price of maize climbed steeply in mid-2018  mainly over concerns about the impact of severe dry weather on the main seasons crops. The same occurred in some countries in East and Southern Africa in the first months of 2019. Economic turmoil also drove up food prices in some countries  while low public inventories and increased fuel costs led to record high prices in others.

  Support to the agriculture sector from domestic and foreign sources continues its downward trend

  Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger and poverty  improving food security  creating employment and building resilience to disasters and shocks. However  government spending on agriculture in relation to its contribution to the economy fell between 2001 and 2017. At the global level  the agriculture orientation index (AOI)the share of government expenditure to agriculture divided by the share of GDP from agriculturefell from 0.42 in 2001 to 0.26 in 2017. From 2015 to 2017  the average AOI was highest in Northern Africa and Western Asia (0.42) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (0.20). Aid to agriculture is only a fraction of what it was in the 1980s. The share of sector-allocable aid to agriculture from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell from nearly 25 per cent in the mid-1980s to only 7 per cent in 2017a total of $12.6 billion.
