  Public investment in agriculture can enhance productivity  attract private investment and help reduce poverty and hunger. The share of government contribution to agriculture compared with the sectors contribution to GDP  known as the agriculture orientation index  fell from 0.42 in 2001 to 0.31 in 2015 and 0.28 in 2018 worldwide. Meanwhile  the share of sector-allocable aid to agriculture from all donors fell from nearly 25 per cent in the mid-1980s to only 5 per cent in 2018  representing $12.8 billion. The fall in agricultural aid is due to a shift in donors focus to social-sector issues  such as improving governance  building social capital and helping fragile states.

  Rising food prices were mostly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019

  Sharp increases in food prices were largely concentrated in subSaharan Africa in 2019  driven by production shocks  macroeconomic difficulties and prolonged conflict. In Eastern Africa  extreme weather conditions reduced agricultural outputs and hampered transport  shrinking market supplies and increasing the price of staple crops. Strong regional demand for exports exerted additional upward pressure on prices. In Western Africa  lingering civil insecurity continued to hamper market activities  thereby adversely impacting food prices. Prices in Southern Africa reached record highs owing to weather-induced shocks and significant economic challenges  including strong depreciation of local currencies. The depreciation of local currencies also contributed to high food prices in other regions  such as Latin America. In 2020  an upsurge in food demand and disruptions to supply chains triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic underpinned food price increases in several countries in the second half of March through April.
