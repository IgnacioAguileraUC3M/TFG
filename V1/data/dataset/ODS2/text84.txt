However  the total number of people going hungry has slowly increased for several consecutive years. Almost 690 million people were undernourished in 2019  up by nearly 60 million from 2014.

      Eliminating hunger alone will not ensure that everyone has access to sufficient nutritious food. An estimated 25.9 per cent of the global population  2 billion people  were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2019  an increase from 22.4 per cent in 2014. People experiencing moderate food insecurity are typically unable to eat a healthy  balanced diet on a regular basis because of income or other resource constraints. Those facing severe food insecurity  around 750 million people  tend to run out of food and  at worst  go a day  or days  without eating. The recent increase in food insecurity was primarily due to worsening situations in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The estimates for 20162019 also indicate that food insecurity was higher among adult women than men in every region.

    Along with conflict  climate shocks and the locust crisis  COVID-19 poses an additional threat to food systems  indirectly reducing purchasing power and the capacity to produce and distribute food  which affects the most vulnerable populations. In 2020  up to 132 million more people may suffer from undernourishment because of COVID-19.
