The prevalence of undernourishment has remained virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level slightly below 11 per cent. Updated figures on undernourishment  food insecurity and malnutrition will be released in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019 (July 2019).
The situation deteriorated significantly in sub-Saharan Africa  where the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in 2014 to 237 million in 2017. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of hunger  with the rate increasing from 20.7 per cent in 2014 to 23.2 per cent in 2017. In South America  the situation also appears to be worsening. This may be the result of an economic slowdown  which reduced fiscal capacity to protect the most vulnerable against rising domestic prices and loss of income. Adverse weather conditions affecting food availability and prices  and prolonged armed conflicts  are among the key drivers of these trends.
