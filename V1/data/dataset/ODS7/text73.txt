
The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption reached 17.3 per cent in 2017  up from 17.0 per cent in 2015 and 16.3 per cent in 2010. This growth was driven primarily by increased consumption of modern renewables  which rose from 8.6 per cent in 2010 to 10.5 per cent in 2017. 
The largest increase in the use of renewables has come from the electricity sector  driven by the rapid expansion of solar and wind power. But the share of renewables in the heat and transportation end-use sectors  which accounted for 80 per cent of final energy use  lagged far behind its potential. An acceleration of modern renewables in all sectors will be needed to achieve the target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy.
Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest share of renewable energy in total energy consumption in 2017  although 85 per cent of it was due to traditional uses of biomass. Latin America and the Caribbean had the largest share of modern renewables among all regions owing to heavy reliance on hydropower and the extensive use of modern bioenergy across all sectors.
