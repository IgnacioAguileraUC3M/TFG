 In 2010  57 per cent of the global population were using clean cooking fuels and technologies  rising to 66 per cent in 2019. This means that 2.6 billion people have been left behind. In sub-Saharan Africa  population increases outstripped growth in access  leaving about 85 per cent of the population reliant on inefficient and dangerous cooking systems. The majority of the poor rely on harmful and polluting fuels such as wood and charcoal to cook  making them especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Meanwhile  the pandemic and resulting lockdowns threaten to derail progress. Unless rapid action is taken  one third of the global population will still be without clean cooking fuels and technologies in 2030  resulting in significant adverse health effects and environmental degradation.
