However  driven by advances in technology and falling costs  wind and solar generation more than doubled over the same period. Most growth in renewable energy has been concentrated in the electricity sector. As a result  the share of renewable energy in power generation rose from 19.6 per cent in 2010 to 22.3 per cent in 2014. However  electricity makes up only 20 per cent of total final energy consumption. The key to expanding renewable energy will be to increase its share in heat and transport  which together account for the remaining 80 per cent of energy consumption. However  the share of renewable energy in the heat sector barely increased  from 25.7 per cent to 26.3 per cent from 2010 to 2014  while the share of renewables in the transport sector remained very lowat 2.8 per centin 2014.
