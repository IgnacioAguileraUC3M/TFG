Ensure access to affordable  reliable  sustainable and modern energy for all

 The world is making progress towards Goal 7 with encouraging signs that energy is becoming more sustainable and widely available. Access to electricity in poorer countries has begun to accelerate  energy efficiency continues to improve  and renewable energy is making impressive gains in the electricity sector. Nevertheless  more focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies for 3 billion people  to expand the use of renewable energy beyond the electricity sector  and to increase electrification in sub-Saharan Africa. 

  Nearly 9 out of 10 people now have access to electricity  but reaching the unserved will require increased efforts
 More people are using electricity than ever before  with the proportion of the global population having access to this service rising from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015  then accelerating to 89 per cent in 2017 (a gain of 1 percentage point annually in the past two years). Still  840 million people were without this essential service in 2017  mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In that region  only 44 per cent of the population had access  and an estimated 573 million people still lacked electricity. 
 Globally  electrification of rural areas progressed swiftly between 2015 and 2017  but a large gap remains. In 2017  rural coverage was 78 per cent compared to 97 per cent in urban areas. This means that 87 per cent of the people currently without electricity live in rural areas. Future electrification efforts will face the complexities of reaching unserved populations  including those who are displaced or living in remote  hard-to-reach communities and those connected to a frail and overburdened urban grid.

  Three billion people still lack clean cooking fuels and technologies  posing a grave threat to human health and the environment
 Access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies has increased since 2010 at an annual rate of 0.5 percentage points  reaching 61 per cent of the global population in 2017. This is far too slow to meet the SDG target and still leaves nearly 3 billion people dependent on inefficient and highly polluting cooking systems  resulting in nearly 4 million premature deaths each year. The lack of cleaner fuels and technologies remains a major contributor to poor health and environmental degradation in low- and middle-income countries.
 In sub-Saharan Africa  advances in the use of clean fuels (such as liquefied petroleum gas  natural gas and electricity) and fuel-efficient stoves have not kept pace with population growth  in contrast to other regions. Tackling the problem will require concerted action on the part of policymakers to address key barriers  including availability  affordability  reliability  limited financing and consumer awareness.

  Progress in the electricity sector must extend to transportation and heating to meet an ambitious renewable energy target
 The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption reached 17.5 per cent in 2016  up from 16.6 per cent in 2010. In absolute terms  renewable energy consumption grew by 18 per cent over that period. The share of modern renewable energy increased at a faster pace  from 8.6 per cent in 2010 to 10.2 per cent in 2016. This category excludes traditional biomass usethat is  the inefficient use of solid biomass  such as the burning of wood  charcoal or other organic matter.
 Most growth in renewable energy has been concentrated in the electricity sector. This is mainly due to the rapid expansion of wind and solar power  prompted by sustained policy support and cost reductions. However  electricity makes up only 20 per cent of final energy use. The remaining 80 per cent is concentrated in the heat and transport sectors  where modern renewables penetrated only 9 per cent and 3.3 per cent of the global market  respectively  in 2016. Meeting the ambitious SDG target will require increased policy attention to the deployment of modern renewables in both of these key sectors.

Notes: Totals may not equal the sum of parts due to rounding. Heat refers to the amount of energy used for heat-generating purposes. Traditional biomass use corresponds to the use of local solid biomass resources by low-income households that do not have access to modern cooking and heating fuels or technologies  including consumption in the residential sector of developing countries.

  Energy efficiency continues to improve  but more concerted action is needed to reach the SDG target
 Improving energy efficiencyalong with increasing energy access and affordabilityis central to the global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Primary energy intensity  defined as total energy supply per unit of GDP  improved by 2.5 per cent in 2016  bringing the annual rate of improvement between 2010 and 2016 to 2.3 per cent. This is far better than the progress observed between 1990 and 2010  when annual improvements averaged 1.3 per cent. However  it still falls short of the SDG target of at least 2.7 per cent. Whats more  the latest estimates for 2017 and 2018 suggest a slowdown in improvement. 
 To boost progress  governments will need to set their energy efficiency ambitions higher. Fortunately  a range of policy options are available  all of which have been implemented in some form  to spur efficiency gains and provide the basis for more effective action.

  International financing for renewable energy in developing countries is rising sharply

      From 2000 to 2009  official international financing commitments for clean and renewable energy in developing countries ranged from $1 billion to $4 billion a year. Commitments rose to $9.9 billion in 2010 and to $18.6 billion by 2016  a tenfold increase from the early 2000s. Yearly financial flows fluctuated greatly  mainly due to the timing of large-scale hydropower investments. But overall  the share of hydropower in the total flow fell from 60 per cent between 2000 and 2009 to around 40 per cent between 2010 and 2016  while the shares of wind  geothermal and  especially  solar energy  increased. Average project size also grew from an average of $10 million per project between 2000 and 2009 to $19 million between 2014 and 2016.
