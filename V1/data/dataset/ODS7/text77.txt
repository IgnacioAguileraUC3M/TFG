
 The world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets  although efforts are not of the scale required to achieve Goal 7 by 2030. Some progress has been made in improving energy efficiency and expanding access to electricity. However  millions of people across the globe still lack this basic service  and progress on clean cooking fuels and technologies has stagnated  affecting the health of billions of women and children in particular.
The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting the urgent need for affordable and reliable energy  for hospital and health facilities to treat patients  for communities to pump clean water and access vital information  and for out-of-school children to learn remotely. At the same time  the crisis is certain to stymie efforts towards Goal 7. Disruptions in supply chains could wreak havoc on energy services  and reduced incomes could limit peoples ability to pay for them. In addition  plummeting oil prices are likely to discourage growth in renewable energy.
