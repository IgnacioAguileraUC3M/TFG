
 Improving energy efficiency is crucial to reaching the global climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2017  global primary energy intensity (defined as total energy supply per unit of GDP) was 5.0 megajoules per dollar  a 1.7 per cent annual improvement from 2016  but the lowest annual improvement since 2010. Nevertheless  progress of 2.2 per cent annually between 2010 and 2017 was more sustained than historical trends. 
The 2030 SDG target calls for a doubling of the historical rate of 1.3 per cent improvement in energy intensity between 1990 and 2010. Preliminary estimates for 2018 and 2019 are 1.3 per cent and 2.0 per cent  respectively. This suggests that the improvement rate would reach approximately 2.1 per cent between 2010 and 2019  thus falling below the annual 2.6 per cent target rate. Meeting the SDG target will require an improvement rate of at least 3 per cent per year from now to 2030  a challenging proposition.
