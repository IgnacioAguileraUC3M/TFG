 Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased from 56 per cent of the global population in 2010 to 60 per cent in 2015 and 63 per cent in 2018. Approximately 2.8 billion people remain without access  a number that has stayed roughly the same over the past two decades. Promising improvements have been made in various Asian regions. However  in sub-Saharan Africa  population growth between 2014 and 2018 outstripped growth in access by an average of 18 million people each year. Slow progress towards clean cooking solutions is of grave global concern  affecting both human health and the environment. Under current and planned policies  2.3 billion people would still be deprived of access to clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2030. This means that nearly one third of the worlds population  mostly women and children  will continue to be exposed to harmful household air pollution.
