 Over the last decade  access to electricity has expanded  use of renewable energy in the electricity sector has increased  and energy efficiency has improved. Still  millions of people are without electricity  and one third of the global population lack clean cooking fuels and technologies. Progress in ensuring energy access has been uneven across regions  leaving the most vulnerable even further behind.
The pandemic is reversing progress and causing millions of people to lose access to electricity. Moreover  depressed oil and gas prices are likely to discourage uptake of clean energy technologies. On the positive side  lower fossil fuel prices provide an opportunity for governments to reform fossil fuel subsidies. Stimulus plans designed to boost economic growth  protect workers and create jobs could scale up the deployment of clean energy technologies.
