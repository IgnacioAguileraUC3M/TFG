Advancements have been slow in some regions  such as sub-Saharan Africa  where access remains very low. Limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas. As a result  the absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking has actually increased  reaching an estimated 3 billion people.
