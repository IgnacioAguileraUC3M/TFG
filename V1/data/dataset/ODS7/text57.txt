      Over the period 20002016  1.4 billion people gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. However  these advancements were mostly offset by population growth during this period. In 2016  59 per cent of the population had access to clean cooking fuels and technologies  an increase of only 10 percentage points since 2000.

    

    The health and well-being of some 3 billion people are adversely impacted by the lack of clean cooking fuels. This is especially true for women and children  who are typically the main procurers and users of household energy. Sub-Saharan Africa  Oceania* and many parts of Asia have the largest populations using polluting fuels. In 2016  some 2.8 billion people still used solid fuels with inefficient stoves  leading to high levels of household air pollution. If current trends continue  2.3 billion people will continue to use traditional cooking methods in 2030. The solution lies in transitioning to cleaner fuels and technologies  like gas and electricity  and improvements in stove efficiency. Addressing issues of affordability  lack of consumer awareness about the benefits of clean cooking  and minimal financing for producers of clean cooking energy technologies are key to accelerating the rate of access to clean cooking.
