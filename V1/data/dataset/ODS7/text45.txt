Among its many benefits  electricity powers computers in schools  charges phones  keeps food cold and businesses and essential infrastructure functioning. In 2014  85.3 per cent of the global population had access to electricity  up from 77.6 per cent in 2000  with progress slowing in the last few years. While 96 per cent of urban residents had access to electricity in 2014  the share was only 73 per cent for those in rural areas.
    

      Globally  1.06 billion people still lived without this essential service  with 80 per cent of them concentrated in just 20 countries. More than half the people without electricity lived in sub-Saharan Africa. The region had the lowest electrification rate overall at 37 per cent  but the figure dropped to just 17 per cent in rural areas. A major challenge is providing electrification rapidly enough to outpace growing populations. While some 86 million people a year are able to access electricity for the first time  this progress has been offset in some areas by population growth.
