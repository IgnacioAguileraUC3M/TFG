Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable  reliable  sustainable and modern energy for all

    Access to affordable  reliable and sustainable energy is crucial to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals  from poverty eradication via advancements in health  education  water supply and industrialization to mitigating climate change. Energy access  however  varies widely across countries and the current rate of progress falls short of what will be required to achieve the Goal. Redoubled efforts will be needed  particularly for countries with large energy access deficits and high energy consumption.
  

  An increasing proportion of the population have gained access to electricity  but 1.1 billion people still live without it

      The proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased steadily  from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. Recent progress was driven largely by advancements in Southern Asia  South-Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Despite these improvements  1.1 billion people are still without this essential service. In particular  over 65 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa are living without electricity. Of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010  the vast majority (80 per cent) are urban dwellers.

  More than 40 per cent of the worlds people still rely on polluting and unhealthy fuels for cooking

      From 2005 to 2014  the proportion of the global population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking  such as gas and  lectricity  increased from 54 per cent to 58 per cent. Advancements have been slow in some regions  such as sub-Saharan Africa  where access remains very low. Limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas. As a result  the absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking has actually increased  reaching an estimated 3 billion people.

  Use of renewable energy is growing only modestly  but modern renewables comprise a large and expanding share

      The share of renewable energyderived from hydropower  solid and liquid biofuels  the wind  sun  biogas  geothermal and marine sources  and wastein the worlds total final energy consumption increased marginally  from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. However  modern renewables  which exclude solid biofuels  grew at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012. The contribution of renewables to the electricity sector has been growing significantly. Modern renewables accounted for 60 per cent of all new power-generating capacity in 2014. In absolute terms  about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions  mostly Eastern Asia.

  Global economic growth is being decoupled from energy use  but not quickly enough

      Energy intensitycalculated by dividing total primary energy supply by GDPreveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. Global energy intensity improved by 1.3 per cent per year from 2000 to 2012  falling from 6.7 megajoules per unit of GDP (2011 US dollars PPP) in 2000 to 5.7 in 2012. A contributing factor was the proportion of energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation  which almost doubled in the last decade (from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014). Still  progress is proceeding at only two-thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Among end-use sectors  industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity  followed closely by transportation. About 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions  with Eastern Asia as the largest contributor.
