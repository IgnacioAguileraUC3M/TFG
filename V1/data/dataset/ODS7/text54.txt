      Global energy intensitythe ratio of energy used per unit of GDPdecreased by 2.8 per cent in 2015  faster than in any year since 1990 and double the rate of improvement between 1990 and 2010. High-income countries showed consistent declines  but at a slower pace than low- and middle-income countries. Emerging economies in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa have now surpassed the global rate of improvement in energy intensity  but their intensity levels are higher than the world average. Among end-use sectors  industry made significant progress  reducing intensity by 4.2 per cent in 2015. To reach the SDG target  global energy intensity needs to improve at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent over the period 20162030  requiring sustained momentum and the systematic adoption of energy efficiency policies in countries that are falling behind.
