Between 2010 and 2020  the proportion of people with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased by 12 percentage points  reaching 69 per cent. This means that an estimated 2.4 billion people still relied on inefficient and polluting cooking systems in 2020. Much of the progress was concentrated in five countries: Brazil  China  India  Indonesia and Pakistan. Excluding those countries  the global access rate remained unchanged over this period. While more than half of those without access live in Asia  19 of the 20 countries with the lowest proportion of the population with access were LDCs in Africa. If current trends continue  only 76 per cent of the global population will have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2030. The adoption of clean cooking solutions can reduce health risks from household air pollution  support a green and healthy recovery and fuel economic growth in low- and middle-income countries.
