      Faster uptake of modern forms of renewable energy is needed to meet an ambitious SDG target
    

      The share of renewables in final energy consumption increased modestly  from 17.3 per cent in 2014 to 17.5 per cent in 2015. Only 55 per cent of the renewable share was derived from modern forms of renewable energy. The remainder represents traditional uses of biomass (such as fuelwood and charcoal)  of which a significant proportion is used by the 3 billion people still using polluting cookstoves. In absolute terms  renewable energy consumption grew by 18 per cent from 2000 to 2015. In 2015  electricity accounted for half of the increase (mostly from wind and solar energy); the other half was mostly bioenergy for heat and transport. Based on the current trend  the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption is projected to reach just 21 per cent by 2030  falling short of the substantial increase called for in the SDG target.
