Commitments rose to $9.9 billion in 2010 and to $18.6 billion by 2016  a tenfold increase from the early 2000s. Yearly financial flows fluctuated greatly  mainly due to the timing of large-scale hydropower investments. But overall  the share of hydropower in the total flow fell from 60 per cent between 2000 and 2009 to around 40 per cent between 2010 and 2016  while the shares of wind  geothermal and  especially  solar energy  increased. Average project size also grew from an average of $10 million per project between 2000 and 2009 to $19 million between 2014 and 2016.
