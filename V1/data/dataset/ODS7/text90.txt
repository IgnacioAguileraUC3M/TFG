The global electricity access rate increased from 83 per cent in 2010 to 91 per cent in 2020. Over this period  the number of people without electricity shrank from 1.2 billion to 733 million. However  the pace of progress has slowed in recent years  due to COVID-19 and the increasing complexity of reaching those hardest to reach. In 20182020  the electricity access rate rose by an average of 0.5 percentage points annually compared to 0.8 percentage points in 20102018.
In 2020  over three quarters (77 per cent) of the global population without electricity lived in sub-Saharan Africa  mainly in rural areas. Due to economic pressures imposed by the pandemic  up to 90 million people connected to electricity in Africa and developing countries in Asia could not afford to have an extended bundle of services that year. If current trends continue  only 92 per cent of the worlds population will have access to electricity in 2030  leaving 670 million people unserved. A major push is needed to reach those living in least developed and in fragile and conflict-affected countries.
