 The global electricity access rate improved from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent in 2019  with 1.1 billion people receiving electricity for the first time. However  759 million people were still without access in 2019  with three quarters of them in sub-Saharan Africa (97 million in urban areas and 471 million in rural areas). At the current pace  660 million people will still be without electricity in 2030  the vast majority of whom (555 million) will be in sub-Saharan Africa.
The COVID-19 pandemic could reverse progress in some countries. In Africa  the number of people without electricity increased in 2020 after declining over the previous six years. In developing countries in Africa and Asia  basic electricity services are now unaffordable for more than 25 million people who had previously gained access  due to population growth and increasing levels of poverty. An additional 85 million people  mainly in developing countries in Asia  may be forced to scale back to basic electricity access because of an inability to pay for an extended bundle of services.
