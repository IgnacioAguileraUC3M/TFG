 Improving energy efficiency  along with increasing renewable energy deployment  is central to the global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The 2030 target calls for a doubling of the historical annual improvement rate in energy intensity between 1990 and 2010. Global primary energy intensity  defined as total energy supply per unit of GDP  improved from 5.6 megajoules per dollar in 2010 to 4.8 in 2018  an annual rate of improvement of 2 per cent. This is well below the 2.6 per cent required to meet the target. As a result  progress in energy intensity up to 2030 will now need to average 3 per cent a year. This remains within reach only with significant investment in cost-effective energy efficiency improvements on a systematic scale. While early estimates for 2019 indicated an improvement rate of 2 per cent  the outlook for 2020 suggests a low level of progress at only 0.8 per cent. In the immediate term  energy efficiency improvements continue  thanks to ongoing investments.
