
The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption gradually increased to 17.1 per cent in 2018  up from 16.4 in 2010. The main contribution came from the electricity sector  where the share of renewables now exceeds 25 per cent. Nonetheless  electricity makes up only around 21 per cent of final energy use. The remaining portion is concentrated in the heat and transport sectors  where  in 2018  modern renewables penetrated 9.2 per cent and 3.4 per cent of the global market  respectively. Traditional uses of biomass  such as the burning of wood for heat  still account for almost 14 per cent of global heat consumption.
Excluding traditional uses of biomass  Latin America and the Caribbean shows the highest share of modern renewable energy in total final energy consumption. This is largely due to significant hydropower generation  and to the use of bioenergy in industrial processes and biofuels for transport. In 2018  more than a third of the global annual increase in modern renewable energy consumption took place in Eastern Asia  where wind- and solar-generated electricity dominated growth.
