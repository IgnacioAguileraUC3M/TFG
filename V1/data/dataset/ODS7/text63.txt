 Access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies has increased since 2010 at an annual rate of 0.5 percentage points  reaching 61 per cent of the global population in 2017. This is far too slow to meet the SDG target and still leaves nearly 3 billion people dependent on inefficient and highly polluting cooking systems  resulting in nearly 4 million premature deaths each year. The lack of cleaner fuels and technologies remains a major contributor to poor health and environmental degradation in low- and middle-income countries.
 In sub-Saharan Africa  advances in the use of clean fuels (such as liquefied petroleum gas  natural gas and electricity) and fuel-efficient stoves have not kept pace with population growth  in contrast to other regions. Tackling the problem will require concerted action on the part of policymakers to address key barriers  including availability  affordability  reliability  limited financing and consumer awareness.
