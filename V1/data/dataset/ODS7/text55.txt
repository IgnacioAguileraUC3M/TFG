This was the first time since 1990 that the absolute number of people living without electricity dipped below the symbolic threshold of one billion. Substantial gains in access rates were achieved in rural areas  in part due to slower population growth  but also aided by an upswing in off-grid solar electricity. Still  access rates to electricity in rural areas (at 76 per cent) are much lower than in urban areas (97 per cent)  and rural residents make up 87 per cent of the global deficit in access.
The largest deficits in electricity are found in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. However  both regions have made substantial progress. From 2000 to 2016  the electricity access rate increased from 60 per cent to 86 per cent in Southern Asia and from 26 per cent
to 43 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite these promising developments  the outlook for electrification shows that the world is not yet on track to achieve universal access by 2030. Some
40 countries have met the target since 2010; another 98 countries will need to intensify their efforts to do so.
