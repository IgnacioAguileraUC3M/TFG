Universal access to affordable  reliable and sustainable energy services requires expanding access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies  as well as improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy.

Increased financing and bolder policies are required  along with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much more ambitious scale.
