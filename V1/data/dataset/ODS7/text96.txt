The world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets. Nevertheless  the current pace of progress is insufficient to achieve Goal 7 by 2030. Improvements in energy efficiency  for example  will need to accelerate to reach the climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Hundreds of millions of people still lack access to electricity  and slow progress towards clean cooking solutions means that the health of 2.4 billion people is at risk. Huge disparities in access to modern sustainable energy persist  leaving the most vulnerable even further behind. In some countries  the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened or reversed advances already made. Rising commodity  energy and shipping prices have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaics modules  wind turbines and biofuels worldwide  adding uncertainty to a development trajectory that is already far below Goal 7 ambitions. Achieving energy and climate goals will require continued policy support and a massive mobilization of public and private capital for clean and renewable energy  especially in developing countries.
