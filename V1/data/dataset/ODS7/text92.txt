The share of renewables in total final energy consumption reached 17.7 per cent in 2019  1.6 percentage points higher than in 2010. However  total renewable energy consumption increased by a quarter over this period. The electricity sector continues to see the fastest progress: the share of renewables in that sector increased from 19.7 per cent in 2010 to 26.2 per cent in 2019. That said  the electricity sector represented only a fifth of global final energy consumption in 2019. The heat sector represents half of this global consumption  but progress there was negligible: the share of modern renewables totalled 10.1 per cent in 2019  a gain of less than 2 percentage points from 2010. Renewable energy used in transport reached 3.6 per cent in 2019  up from 2.6 per cent in 2010. Traditional uses of biomass  such as the burning of wood for heat  remained stable  still representing more than a third of total renewable energy use in 2019. Effective climate action will require
strengthening policy support in all sectors and implementing effective tools to further mobilize private capital  particularly for developing countries.
