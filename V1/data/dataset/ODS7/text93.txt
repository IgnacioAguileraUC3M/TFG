Improving energy efficiency is fundamental to meeting global climate goals. The 2030 target calls for an annual improvement in energy intensity of 2.6 per cent  a doubling of the rate observed between 1990 and 2010. Global primary energy intensity  defined as the ratio of total energy supply to GDP  improved from 5.6 megajoules per US dollar (2017 purchasing power parity) in 2010 to 4.7 in 2019  with an average annual improvement rate of 1.9 per cent. To meet the Coal 7 target  and make up for lost time  energy intensity improvements until 2030 will need to average 3.2 per cent a year. The target remains within reach  but only with significant investment in cost-effective energy efficiency improvements on a systematic scale. Regional progress varies due to differences in economic structure  energy supply and electrification. The only region that has reached the target so far is Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  with an annual average rate of 2.7 per cent in 20102019  driven by strong economic growth.
