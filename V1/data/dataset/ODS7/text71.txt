 The proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent in 2018  meaning that over 1 billion people acquired this essential service. Still  789 million people  85 per cent in rural areas  lacked electricity in 2018. Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia maintained strong progress  exceeding 98 per cent access by 2018. The deficit is increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa  affecting about 548 million people  or 53 per cent of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic spotlights the need for reliable and affordable electricity. A 2018 survey conducted in six African and Asian countries showed that one quarter of health facilities surveyed were not electrified  and another quarter experienced unscheduled outages  which affected their capacity for essential health services. Damage to equipment caused by poor connections and voltage fluctuations impacted 28 per cent of health centres. These deficits further weaken the response of health systems to the coronavirus crisis.
To meet the target of universal access to electricity by 2030  the annual rate of electrification has to rise from the current 0.82 percentage points to 0.87 for 2019 to 2030. At the current rate of progress  a projected 620 million people would still lack access to electricity in 2030. This estimate does not  however  take into account the disruptions caused by COVID-19.
