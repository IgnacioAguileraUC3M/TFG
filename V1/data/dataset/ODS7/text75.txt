This is 13 per cent more than in 2016 and double the level of 2010. Investment in hydropower projects represented 46 per cent of 2017 flows  followed by investments in solar (19 per cent)  wind (7 per cent) and geothermal energy (6 per cent). While the progress is encouraging  only 12 per cent of these financial flows reached the least developed countries  which are the farthest behind in reaching Goal 7 targets. Focused attention is needed to ensure that financing reaches countries most in need.
