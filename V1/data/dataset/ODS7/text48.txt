Globally  primary energy intensity declined by 2.1 per cent a year from 2012 to 2014. Over that period  three quarters of the worlds 20 largest energy-consuming countries reduced their energy intensity. The associated savings were equivalent to the total energy consumed by Brazil and Pakistan combined in 2014. However  progress is insufficient to double the global rate of improvements in energy efficiency as called for by the target.
    

      Industry and passenger transport sectors contributed to declining global energy intensity through greater efficiencies  with annual reductions of 2.2 per cent and 2.8 per cent  respectively  between 2012 and 2014. In transport  widespread diffusion of fuel-efficiency standards helped accelerate reductions in energy intensity  particularly for passenger transport. The residential sector  on the other hand  has become more energy intensive over time.
