Recent advances in sustainable energy are encouraging signs for ensuring access to affordable  reliable and modern energy for all. Access to electricity is outpacing population growth in many countries. In addition  energy efficiency continues to improve  which is offsetting carbon dioxide emissions  reducing energy demand and making energy more affordable. Although renewable energy in the electricity sector has advanced rapidly  accelerated progress is also needed in the areas of transport  heating and cooling. Despite some steps forward  41 per cent of the worlds population still lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Overall  progress on Goal 7 remains too slow to be on track to meet the global energy targets for 2030.
