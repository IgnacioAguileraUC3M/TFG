From 2000 to 2014  the proportion of the global population with access to such fuels and technologies (for instance gas and electricity) increased from 50 per cent to 57 per cent  progressing much more slowly than electrification. About 3 billion people  the majority in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  are still cooking without the benefit of clean fuels and technologies. Rural areas lagged behind urban areas  with 22 per cent access versus 78 per cent  a gap much larger than in the case of access to electricity.
    

      Although 80 million people globally gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies during 2012-2014  population growth offset this gain. Current progressa 0.46 percentage point increase annuallyis far lower than the annual 2.66 percentage point increase required for universal access by 2030.
