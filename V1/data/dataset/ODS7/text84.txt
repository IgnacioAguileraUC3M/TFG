Such annual fluctuations are mostly due to variations in large hydropower commitments. Hydropower  solar  geothermal and wind projects received 27 per cent  26 per cent  8 per cent and 5 per cent of 2018 flows  respectively. Public financial flows continue to be concentrated in a few countries. Argentina  India  Nigeria  Pakistan and Turkey  for instance  received 30 per cent of total commitments from 2010 to 2018. In contrast  the 46 least developed countries together received only 20 per cent of commitments over the same period. Most of the countries with the lowest levels of electricity access are LDCs (particularly in sub-Saharan Africa)  but many receive far less international public funding than the global average when measured on a per capita basis.
