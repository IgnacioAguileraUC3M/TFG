Global energy intensity improved by 1.3 per cent per year from 2000 to 2012  falling from 6.7 megajoules per unit of GDP (2011 US dollars PPP) in 2000 to 5.7 in 2012. A contributing factor was the proportion of energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation  which almost doubled in the last decade (from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014). Still  progress is proceeding at only two-thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Among end-use sectors  industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity  followed closely by transportation. About 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions  with Eastern Asia as the largest contributor.
