In the decade before the pandemic  the GDP generated by international tourism increased at a higher rate than the rest of the economy  representing 4.1 per cent of global GDP in 2019. However  as one of the sectors most affected by the pandemic  a reversal in this trend is expected for 2020 and the coming years. International tourist arrivals fell drastically from 2019 to 2020  from 1.5 billion to 381 million. This represents a 74 per cent decline  which takes tourism back to levels seen 30 years ago. It also translates into an estimated loss of $1.3 trillion in global inbound tourism expenditure (spending by non-resident visitors)  more than 11 times the loss experienced as a result of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. An estimated 100 million to 120 million tourism jobs have been put at risk due to the pandemic  disproportionally affecting women.
The massive drop in tourism affects all regions  with millions of livelihoods and businesses at risk  and jeopardizes progress towards the SDGs.  The impact is especially pronounced in small island developing States (SIDS)  since they are more reliant than other countries on tourism as a source of income and employment. Among those States with available data  inbound tourism expenditure represents 25 per cent of GDP on average  compared with 5 per cent among non-SIDS with data. Worldwide  many countries have been able to alleviate the impact of the crisis through the domestic tourism market. However  this is not a feasible alternative for SIDS in the short term  since they are heavily dependent on international tourism and have relatively small domestic markets. International tourism is not expected to return to 2019 levels for up to four years  leaving the poorest island States disadvantaged in terms of progress towards the SDGs.
