Sustained and inclusive economic growth drives development by providing more resources for education  health  personal consumption  and transport  water and energy infrastructure. Economic growth can also lead to new and better employment opportunities. Sustaining high real economic growth is not easy  however  and only a few LDCs have consistently closed in on the 7 per cent average annual growth target for real GDP. Moreover  economic growth is not necessarily sustainable when countries are depleting their natural resources for the sake of economic growth and thus shifting the burden of environmental degradation and damage to future generations.
