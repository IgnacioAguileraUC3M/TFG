
The global economy is slowly improving  although recovery remains fragile and uneven. Globally  real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by 1.4 per cent in 2019  then fell sharply in 2020  by 4.4 per cent  rebounding in 2021 at an estimated growth rate of 4.4 per cent. Before the Ukraine crisis  global real GDP per capita was projected to increase by 3.0 per cent in 2022  and 2.5 per cent in 2023. The war in that country is now likely to cut growth to 2.1 per cent in 2022. 
For LDCs  real GDP grew by 5.0 per cent in 2019  and showed zero growth in 2020 due to pandemic-related disruptions. Real GDP of LDCs is estimated to have increased by 1.4 per cent in 2021. It is projected to rise by 4.0 per cent in 2022  and 5.7 per cent in 2023 - still well below the 7 per cent target envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
