Growth in labour productivity in developing regions outpaced that of developed regions  especially in Asia. That said  the productivity of workers in the poorest regions is still only a small fraction of that of workers in the developed world. Workers in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  for example  are only about 5 per cent as productive as those in developed regions  when measured as a percentage of GDP. Even the developing region with the highest labour productivity  Western Asia  has only about 40 per cent of the labour productivity of developed regions  and this rate has declined slightly since 2000.
