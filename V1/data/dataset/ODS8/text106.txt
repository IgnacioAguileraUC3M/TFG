 Globally  real GDP per capita growth rate was 2.0 per cent in 2018  the same level as the average annual growth rate between 2010 and 2018. Sustained per capita growth during this period was driven mainly by strong progress in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and in Central and Southern Asia. In 2019  the growth rate dropped to 1.5 per cent and  in 2020  the coronavirus pandemic is pushing the world into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Real GDP per capita is expected to decline by 4.2 per cent in 2020 before increasing again in 2021 at a rate of 3.1 per cent. 
Real GDP growth rate for LDCs reached 4.5 per cent in 2018 and 4.8 per cent in 2019. Due to the pandemic  that rate is expected to weaken to 0.8 per cent in 2020 and is projected to increase again at a rate of 4.6 per cent in 2021. This means that LDCs are falling short of the SDG target of at least 7 per cent real GDP growth per year.
