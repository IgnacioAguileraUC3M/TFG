 The global economy grew by an average of about 2 per cent from 2014 to 2018. In 2019  real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by only 1.3 per cent globally and is estimated to have decreased by 4.6 per cent in 2020. With the roll-out of vaccines and government aid  a global economic recovery is under way  led by China and the United States. Global GDP per capita is projected to increase by 4.3 per cent in 2021 and 3.1 per cent in 2022. However  for many countries  economic growth is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022 or 2023. 
For LDCs  real GDP increased by 4.8 per cent in 2019 and is expected to have decreased by 0.3 per cent in 2020 due to pandemic disruption. In 2021 and 2022  real GDP growth in LDCs is projected to pick up again  reaching 4.0 and 5.0 per cent  respectively. However  it is expected to remain well below the 7 per cent target envisioned by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
