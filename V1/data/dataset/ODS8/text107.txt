 The global average output per worker  a measure of labour productivity  has steadily increased since 2000  with growth interrupted only briefly during the economic downturn of 2009. The growth rate in labour productivity reached 1.6 per cent in 2018 and 1.4 per cent in 2019. However  these levels varied considerably across regions: in 2019  while labour productivity declined in Latin America and the Caribbean  Northern Africa and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  it rose everywhere else and was especially fast in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and in Central and Southern Asia. Labour productivity growth in 2020 may be adversely affected by the global reduction in working hours and the economic decline caused by the coronavirus crisis.
