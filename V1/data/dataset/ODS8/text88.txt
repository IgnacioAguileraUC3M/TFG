Growth in labour productivitymeasured by GDP per workerslowed sharply after the financial crisis of 2008-2009  expanding at an average annual rate of 1.9 per cent between 2009 and 2016  compared to 2.9 per cent between 2000 and 2008. Nearly every region of the world with the exception of Oceania  excluding Australia and New Zealand  experienced a significant slowdown  most notably Northern Africa and Western Asia  sub-Saharan Africa  and Europe and Northern America. Growth in labour productivity drives sustainable increases in living standards and real wages. The slowdown therefore represents a negative development for the global economy and for many labour markets around the world.
