The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the worst economic crisis in decades and reversed progress towards decent work for all. Although the global economy began to rebound in 2021  bringing some improvement in unemployment  recovery remains elusive and fragile. Recovery patterns also vary significantly across regions  countries  sectors and labour market groups. Developed economies are experiencing a more robust recovery  while least developed countries (LDCs) continue to struggle with weak economic growth and labour market fallout due to workplace closures. Many small firms  particularly those in low- and lower-middle-income countries  are especially disadvantaged  with limited capacity to remain viable. Labour market groups most affected by the crisis - women  youth and persons with disabilities - are the last to recover. By the end of 2021  global economic recovery had been hampered by new waves of COVID-19 infections  rising inflationary pressures  major supply-chain disruptions  policy uncertainties and persistent labour market challenges. The conflict in Ukraine is expected to seriously set back global economic growth in 2022.
