 In 2019  the global unemployment rate stood at 5 per cent. Joblessness that year was particularly pervasive in Northern Africa and Western Asia  where 11 per cent of the labour force were unemployed  and the female unemployment rate was 9 percentage points higher than that of males. The unemployment rate was also considerably higher among young workers than among adults in all regions in 2019. Furthermore  in 40 out of the 59 countries with recent and comparable data  the unemployment rate was higher for persons with disabilities. 
 The pandemic is expected to have a devastating impact on global unemployment. According to estimates from the International Labour Organization  global working hours could drop by 14 per cent in the second quarter of 2020. This is equivalent to approximately 400 million full-time workers doing a 48-hour work week. The eventual increase in global unemployment over 2020 will depend on how effectively policy measures preserve existing jobs and boost labour demand once the recovery phase begins.
