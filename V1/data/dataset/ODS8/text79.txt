In the period 2010-2014  the global average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita was 1.6 per cent  slightly below the rate achieved over the period of 20002004. The growth rate of countries in developing regions was more than triple that of developed regions (4.1 per cent versus 1.3 per cent  respectively)  yet the rates for both regions were below their historical averages. This suggests that much work remains to achieve the goal of sustained and inclusive economic growth. The challenge is particularly steep for the least developed countries  whose per capita growth accelerated for a time  but has since slowed to only 2.6 per cent on average during 2010-2014  less than half the target rate of at least 7 per cent a year.
