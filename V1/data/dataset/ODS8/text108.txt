 In 2016  an alarming 61 per cent of workers globally were engaged in informal employment. Typically  informality has a negative impact on earnings  working time  occupational safety and health  and working conditions generally. In 2016  informal employment was much more widespread in the agricultural sector (94 per cent) than in the non-agricultural sector (51 per cent). Reliance on informal workers was also more prevalent in certain regions  including sub-Saharan Africa (89 per cent) and Central and Southern Asia (86 per cent). Due to unemployment and underemployment caused by the coronavirus crisis  some 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy  half of the global workforce  may be significantly affected. Globally  the income of informal workers is estimated to have dropped by 60 per cent in the first month of the crisis  and up to 81 per cent in some regions.
