The number of children (aged 5 to 17) in child labour globally declined from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012. Still  child labour remains a serious concern. Around 1 in 10 children worldwide were engaged in child labour in 2012; more than half of them (85 million) were exposed to hazardous forms of work. About 59 per cent of child labourers worked in the agricultural sector. From 2000 to 2012  the number of girls engaged in child labour declined by 40 per cent  versus a decline of 25 per cent for boys. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest incidence of child labour  involving more than one in five children (21.4 per cent  or 59 million).
