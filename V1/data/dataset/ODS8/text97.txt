 Real GDP per capitaa proxy for the average standard of living increased globally by 1.9 per cent in 2017  compared to by 1.3 per cent in 2016. That growth is expected to remain steady at about 2 per cent until 2020. In least developed countries (LDCs)  the SDG target aims for at least 7 per cent real GDP growth. In those countries  real GDP accelerated from an average annual rate of 5.8 per cent over the period 2000 to 2004  to 7.1 per cent over 2005 to 2009  before slowing to 4.8 per cent over 2010 to 2017. Growth in LDCs is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent in 2020 owing to favourable external economic conditions along with stable commodity prices that encourage financial flows and investment in natural resource projects and infrastructure. However  this still falls short of the target. Policies that promote economic diversification in those countries are needed to ensure long-term sustainability and more inclusive growth.
