In contrast  real GDP per capita growth slowed in LDCs  LLDCs and SIDS to an average of 2.5  3.4 and 2.2 per cent  respectively  in 2010-2015. Overall real GDP growth in LDCs averaged 4.9 per cent in 20102015  compared to 7.1 per cent in 2005-2009. Accelerated progress is needed if LDCs are to reach the target of at least 7 per cent annual growth in real GDP.
