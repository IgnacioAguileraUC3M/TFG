The global unemployment rate is projected to remain above its 2019 level of 5.4 per cent  at least until 2023. In 2021  unemployment declined slightly to 6.2 per cent  which still translates into 28 million more unemployed persons in 2021 than in 2019. Furthermore  the level of unemployment underestimates the full employment impact of the COVID-19 crisis  since many who left the labour force have not returned. It also does not reflect the reduction in working hours for those who remained employed. In 2021  4.3 per cent of global working hours were lost relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 - equivalent to a deficit of 125 million full-time jobs (based on a 48-hour work week). Labour market recovery has been inadequate and unequal. In 2021  the unemployment rate improved the most in high-income countries  but worsened in LDCs  landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). The groups that were disproportionately impacted since the onset of the pandemic  women  youth and persons with disabilities  are having the hardest time recovering.
