 After the global economic downturn in 2009  the world as a whole witnessed rising labour productivity and improved unemployment rates  despite large disparities across regions. Ten years later  in 2019  the global economy again slowed  with the lowest growth since 20082009. The coronavirus in 2020 has caused abrupt and profound changes  slowing the economy even further. It is having an adverse impact on the world's labour markets  particularly on workers in informal employment  the self-employed  daily wage earners and workers in sectors at the highest risk of disruption. In fact  we can expect the biggest increase in global unemployment since World War II. At the same time  the crisis poses a serious threat to the occupational safety and health of workers  and may increase the risk of child labour. Urgent policy measures are needed to support businesses  boost labour demand and preserve existing jobs  especially for the most vulnerable  to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men.
