The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented and volatile shifts in global labour productivity. In 2020  sharp declines were seen in both output and employment  and global output per worker dropped by 0.6 per cent - the first decline since 2009. However  since working hours plunged by 8.9 per cent  productivity measured on a per-hour basis surged by 4.9 per cent. Lower-productivity firms and sectors and lower-paid workers were disproportionately affected by the pandemic  while high-productivity enterprises and high earners saw far less damage. Many small firms are disadvantaged  with limited capacity to remain viable over an extended period. In 2021  global output per worker rebounded sharply  rising by 3.2 per cent; however  productivity in LDCs declined by 1.6 per cent. The average worker in a high-income country produced 13.6 times more output than the average worker in a low-income country in 2021.
