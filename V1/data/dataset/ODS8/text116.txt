 By 2020  the global unemployment rate reached 6.5 per cent  up 1.1 percentage points from the previous year. The number of people unemployed worldwide increased by 33 million  reaching 220 million. Another 81 million people left the labour market altogether. Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe and Northern America recorded increases in the unemployment rate of at least 2 percentage points. 
Youth and women were especially hard hit  with employment losses of 8.7 per cent and 5.0 per cent  respectively  in 2020  compared with 3.7 per cent for adults and 3.9 per cent for men. Before the pandemic  the unemployment rate of youth was already three times that of adults. During the crisis  women were more likely than men to drop out of the labour force in order to care for children. This further increased longstanding gender gaps in labour force participation rates.
