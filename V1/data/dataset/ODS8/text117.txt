Before the pandemic  informal employment represented 60.2 per cent of global employment. This means that 2 billion people worldwide worked in jobs characterized by lack of basic protection  including social protection coverage. The share is much higher in LDCs  where the proportion of informal employment in total employment was 88.7 per cent in 2019. Globally  the share of informal employment was 90.7 per cent in the agriculture sector  compared with 48.9 per cent in the non-agricultural sector. 
Estimates suggest that three quarters of informal economy workers (1.6 billion) were significantly affected by lockdown measures and/or were working in the hardest-hit sectors. Among them  women were overrepresented in so-called high-risk sectors: 42 per cent of women workers were engaged in those sectors  compared with 32 per cent of men. These workers face a high risk of falling into poverty and will experience greater challenges in regaining their livelihoods during the recovery.
