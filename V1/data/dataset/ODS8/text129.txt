 The proportion of the world's youth not engaged in either education  employment or training (NEET) increased from 21.8 per cent in 2015-2019 to 23.3 per cent in 2020  due to the pandemic. This represents an increase of almost 20 million women and men aged 15 to 24. Although youth represented only 13 per cent of total employment before the crisis  they made up 34.2 per cent of the 2020 decline in employment. Meanwhile  both technical and vocational education and on-the-job training suffered massive disruptions  forcing many young people to quit their studies. Globally  young women are much more likely than young men to find themselves unemployed and without education or some form of training programme to fall back on. In 2020  the NEET rate was 31.5 per cent for young women  compared to 15.7 per cent for young men. The development and implementation of national youth employment strategies is increasing across most regions. More than half of the 81 reporting countries in 2021 have operationalized such strategies  while slightly less than one third have developed one  but have not provided conclusive evidence on implementation.
