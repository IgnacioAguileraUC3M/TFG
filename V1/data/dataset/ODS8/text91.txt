Access to financial services enables individuals and firms to manage changes in income  deal with fluctuating cash flows  accumulate assets and make productive investments. Globally  access to automated teller machines (ATMs) increased by 55 per cent between 2010 and 2015. Commercial bank branches grew by 5 per cent over the same period  with the lower growth explained by increased digital access to financial services. There were 60 ATMs and 17 commercial bank branches per 100 000 adults in 2015. Compared to other regions  the availability and growth of both types of access are relatively low in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand). Between 2011 and 2014  700 million adults became new account holders  and the share of adults with an account at a financial institution increased from 51 per cent to 61 per cent. In Australia and New Zealand as well as in Europe and Northern America  access to ATMs has become almost universal while the number of commercial bank branches has declined.
