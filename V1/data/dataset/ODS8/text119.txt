 In 2019  22.3 per cent of the worlds youth were not engaged in either education  employment or training (NEET)  a share that has shown no reduction in over a decade. Moreover  quarterly figures indicate that the NEET rate worsened from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020 in 42 out of 49 countries with available data. This is not surprising  as young workers were more severely affected than older workers by employment losses in 2020. Both technical and vocational education and on-the-job training suffered massive disruption  forcing many to quit their studies. 
Worldwide  young women are twice as likely as young men to be jobless and not engaged in education or training. In 2019  the global NEET rate was 31.1 per cent for young women  compared with 14.0 per cent for young men. Since more women than men have been pushed out of the labour force during the pandemic  the crisis is likely to worsen the NEET gender gap.
