 Informal employment remains pervasive throughout the developing world. Based on the latest available data for 54 developing countries  in three quarters of countries  more than half of those with jobs in non-agricultural sectors are informally employed. In about 70 per cent of countries  the share of informal employment in non-agricultural sectors is higher for women than for men. These findings warrant urgent attention from policymakers given the adverse impact of informal employment on earnings  social protection  occupational safety  health and working conditions generally. Informal employment is linked to higher poverty rates and is a major challenge to the goal of decent work for all. 

  The continuing pay gap between women and men is a glaring reminder of gender inequality
 Women still earn less than men. An analysis of the latest available data for 62 countries found that mens median hourly pay is 12 per cent higher than that of women. Furthermore  men had a wage advantage in every major occupational category in 49 countries with relevant data. The median gender pay gap exceeded 20 per cent in managerial and professional occupations  and among craft and related trade workers and plant machine operators and assemblers. Gender pay gaps are rooted in rigid social norms and cultural expectations about womens roles in society. When combined with differences in employment opportunities and lower access to social protection  they can result in long-term income gaps and compromise gender equality now and in the future.
