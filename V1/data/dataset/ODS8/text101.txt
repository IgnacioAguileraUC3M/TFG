 In 2018  one fifth of the worlds youth were not engaged in either education  employment or training (NEET). In other words  they were neither gaining professional experience nor acquiring or developing skills through educational or vocational programmes during that formative stage of life. The situation is most serious in Central and Southern Asia and in Northern African and Western Asia  where more than one quarter of youth fall into this category. 
 Gender differences in this regard are pervasive. In 2018  young women were more than twice as likely as young men to be unemployed or outside the labour force and not in school or in a training programme (young women had a NEET rate of 30 per cent compared to 13 per cent for young men). In Central and Southern Asia  46 per cent of young women fell into this category compared to 10 per cent of young men.
