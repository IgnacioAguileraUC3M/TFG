 Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress  create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. Globally  real GDP per capita and labour productivity have increased  and unemployment has dropped back to pre-financial-crisis levels. However  sluggish growth overall has prompted a rethinking of economic and social policies to achieve the transformational objectives of Goal 8 so as to meet economic growth targets in least developed countries; increase employment opportunities  especially for young people; reduce inequalities across regions  age groups and genders; decrease informal employment; and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers.
