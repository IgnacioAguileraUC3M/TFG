Despite a pandemic-related economic slowdown  the climate crisis continues largely unabated. A temporary reduction in human activities resulted in a dip in emissions. However  concentrations of greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2020  reaching new record highs. It was one of the three warmest years on record  with the global average temperature about 1.2C above the 18501900 baseline.  The world remains woefully off track in meeting the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero carbon dioxide CO2 emissions globally by 2050.
In the face of looming catastrophe  climate action is gaining momentum. In June 2020  the Race to Zero campaign was launched to form a coalition of businesses  cities  regions and investors around net-zero carbon emission initiatives  and set out specific near-term tipping points for more than 20 sectors of the global economy. As of December 2020  over two thirds of the worlds GDP was being generated in places with actual or intended net zero by 2050 targets  covering over half of the worlds population and emissions.
The global pandemic has laid bare humanitys vulnerabilities. It has shown the world how much damage can be wreaked by a crisis that pales in comparison to a full-scale climate emergency. We must heed this wake-up call and seize the opportunity to rebuild in a way that will reduce emissions and increase resilience to climate change.
