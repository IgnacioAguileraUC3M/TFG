It is a continuous  progressive and iterative process with a country-driven  gender-sensitive  participatory and fully transparent approach. Implementation helps countries reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience  and by integrating climate change adaptation into development planning processes and strategies. As of 7 June 2017  seven countries had completed and submitted the first iteration of their NAP; the process in many other countries is under way. Progress is expected to accelerate with support from the Green Climate Fund  which is mandated to provide expedited support to LDCs and other developing countries in the formulation and implementation of NAPs.
