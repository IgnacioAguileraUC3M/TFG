
The world is on the brink of a climate catastrophe  and the window to avert it is closing rapidly. Increased heatwaves  droughts and floods caused by climate change are already affecting billions of people around the world and causing potentially irreversible changes in global ecosystems. To limit warming to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels  as set out in the Paris Agreement  global greenhouse gas emissions will need to peak before 2025. Then they must decline by 43 per cent by 2030  falling to net zero by 2050  according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  the United Nations body responsible for assessing the science related to climate change.
  In response  countries are articulating climate action plans to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts through nationally determined contributions. However  current national commitments are not sufficient to meet the 1.5 C target. Under these commitments  greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase by almost 14 per cent over the next decade. Immediate and deep reductions in emissions are needed across all sectors to move from a tipping point headed to climate calamity to a turning point for a sustainable future.
