
 National adaptation plans (NAPs) help countries achieve the global goal on adaptation under the Paris Agreement  namely  to enhance adaptive capacity  strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. In 2019  at least 120 of the 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement NAPs  an increase of 29 countries over the previous year. Eighteen countries  including five LDCs and four small island developing States  have completed and submitted their NAPs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat  while many others are at various stages in the process.
Funding for the formulation of NAPs is provided by the Green Climate Fund  through its Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme  and by the Least Developed Countries Fund. As of December 2019  81 countries had submitted 83 proposals totalling $203.8 million in requested support from the Green Climate Fund. Of these countries  29 (35 per cent) were LDCs. A total of 40 proposals had been approved  14 of them (35 per cent) from LDCs. Fewer proposals (12 as of 3 October) were submitted in 2019 than in previous years (22 in 2018 and 42 in 2017). Nine project proposals under the Least Developed Countries Fund were also approved to support the formulation and implementation of NAPs.
