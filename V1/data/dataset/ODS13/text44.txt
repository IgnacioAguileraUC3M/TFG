Climate change is already having a profound and alarming impact worldwide. Global temperatures continued to increase in 2016  setting a new record of about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period. The extent of global sea ice fell to 4.14 million square kilometres in 2016  the second lowest on record. Atmospheric CO2 levels reached 400 parts per million. Drought conditions predominated across much of the globe  influenced by the El Nio phenomenon. In addition to rising sea levels and global temperatures  extreme weather events are becoming more common and natural habitats such as coral reefs are declining. These changes affect people everywhere  but disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable. Concerted action is urgently needed to stem climate change and strengthen resilience to pervasive and ever-increasing climate-related hazards.
