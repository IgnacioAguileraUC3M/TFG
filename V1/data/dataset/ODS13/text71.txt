
Climate finance provided by developed to developing countries continues to increase  reflecting an ongoing commitment to support the global transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient future. Total climate finance reported by Annex I Parties to the Paris Agreement reached an annual average of $48.7 billion in 20172018. This represents an increase of 10 per cent over 20152016. While over half of all climate-specific financial support for 20172018 was targeted at mitigation  the share of adaptation support is growing  and many countries are prioritizing adaptation in their provision of financial support. 
Two thirds of financial support provided in 20172018 (equivalent to an annual average of $32.3 billion) flowed through bilateral  regional and other channels  while the remaining third was channelled through multilateral institutions and funds  such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Support for the formulation of national adaptation plans through the GCF Readiness Programme is steadily increasing in all regions and groups. Eleven developing countries have submitted 23 project proposals to the GCF  of which 7  totalling $464 million  have been approved.
In 20172018  climate-specific support constituted the largest share of total climate finance ($36.2 billion). The share of core/general support (financial support provided to multilateral and bilateral institutions that is not considered climate-specific) has been decreasing over time  from over 40 per cent of the total in 20112012 to roughly 25 per cent in 20172018.
