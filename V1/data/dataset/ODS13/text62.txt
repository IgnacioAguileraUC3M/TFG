The spurt in growth was largely due to high levels of new private investment in renewable energy  which represents the largest segment in total climate-related flows. However  investments in climate activities across sectors continued to be surpassed by those related to fossil fuels in the energy sector  which totalled $781 billion in 2016. To achieve a low-carbon  climate-resilient transition  a much greater scale of annual investment is required.
