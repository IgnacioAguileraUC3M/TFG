The period from 2011 to 2015 was the hottest on record  with sea ice reaching its lowest level in history and coral bleaching  resulting from increased sea surface temperatures  threatening the worlds coral reefs. The landmark Paris Agreement  signed in April 2016 by 175 Member States  attempts to mitigate climate change and accelerate and intensify actions and investments needed for a sustainable  low-carbon future. Central to the agreement is the need to strengthen the global response to keep global temperatures from rising no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue further efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement requires parties to identify their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). Progress on the Paris Agreement will be tracked every five years through a global stocktaking exercise.
