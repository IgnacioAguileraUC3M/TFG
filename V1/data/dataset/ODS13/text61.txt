
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change  the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible  with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030  and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 20002018. Meanwhile  the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020  189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement  and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition  17 long-term strategies  18 national adaptation plans  and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020  parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones  with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic  which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide  offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.
