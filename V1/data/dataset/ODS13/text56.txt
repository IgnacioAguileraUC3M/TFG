
 Many developing countries have launched a process to formulate and implement national adaptation plans (NAPs) to reduce their vulnerability to climate change and to integrate climate change adaptation into national development planning. Those plans will help countries achieve the global goal on adaptation under the Paris Agreementnamely  to enhance adaptive capacity  strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Thirteen countries  four of which are LDCs  have completed and submitted their NAPs to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  while many others are at various stages in the process. Since 2015  the number of countries that have launched or initiated NAPs has increased by 45 per cent.
 Funding for the formulation of NAPs is provided by the Green Climate Fund Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme and the Least Developed Countries Fund. As of May 2019  75 countries had sought a total of $191 million in support from the Green Climate Fund for NAPs and other adaptation planning processes. Of those  28 countries had accessed a total of $75 million  two thirds of which went to LDCs  small island developing States and countries in Africa. Another seven countries were in the final stage of approval for a total of $17 million in funding. Nine project proposals under the Least Developed Countries Fund were also approved to support the formulation and implementation of NAPs. Technical guidance and support to developing countries for NAPs is provided by the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and other constituted bodies under the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change. A total of 154 support activities have been reported since 2014.
