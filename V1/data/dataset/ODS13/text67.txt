Despite a pandemic-related economic slowdown  the climate crisis continues largely unabated. A temporary reduction in human activities resulted in a dip in emissions. However  concentrations of greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2020  reaching new record highs. It was one of the three warmest years on record  with the global average temperature about 1.2C above the 18501900 baseline.  The world remains woefully off track in meeting the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero carbon dioxide CO2 emissions globally by 2050.
In the face of looming catastrophe  climate action is gaining momentum. In June 2020  the Race to Zero campaign was launched to form a coalition of businesses  cities  regions and investors around net-zero carbon emission initiatives  and set out specific near-term tipping points for more than 20 sectors of the global economy. As of December 2020  over two thirds of the worlds GDP was being generated in places with actual or intended net zero by 2050 targets  covering over half of the worlds population and emissions.
The global pandemic has laid bare humanitys vulnerabilities. It has shown the world how much damage can be wreaked by a crisis that pales in comparison to a full-scale climate emergency. We must heed this wake-up call and seize the opportunity to rebuild in a way that will reduce emissions and increase resilience to climate change.

  Greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase without critical steps to shift economies towards carbon neutrality
In 2015  196 Parties to the Paris Agreement committed to transforming their development trajectories towards sustainability and called for limiting global warming to well below 2C  ideally 1.5C  above pre-industrial levels. To meet these goals  global carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels  and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs in 2020  with globally averaged mole fractions of CO2 exceeding 410 parts per million.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced human activities in 2020  leading to a temporary fall in CO2emissions. Developed countries saw the steepest declines  averaging drops of almost 10 per cent  while emissions from developing countries fell by 4 per cent relative to 2019. Despite the temporary reduction in emissions overall in 2020  real-time data from specific locations  including Mauna Loa  United States  and Cape Grim  Tasmania  indicate that concentration levels of CO2  methane and nitrous oxide continued to increase in 2020. By December 2020  emissions had fully rebounded and registered 2 per cent higher than the same month in 2019. As the world recovers from the pandemic  emissions are expected to rise further unless critical steps are taken to shift economies towards carbon neutrality.

  Notwithstanding a global pandemic  countries are advancing climate action  with a focus on adaptation
The voluntary efforts countries are making to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change are described in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Each Party to the Paris Agreement is requested to prepare  communicate and maintain successive NDCs that it intends to achieve. As of May 2021  192 Parties had submitted their first NDCs to the Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat. Moreover  as of December 2020  48 of them were submitted as new or updated NDCs  representing 75 Parties and accounting for 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. Adaptation information was included in 39 of these 48 new or updated NDCs. Countries are articulating more quantified targets and indicators for adaptation  and identifying links between adaptation  the Sustainable Development Goals and other frameworks. The highest-priority areas for adaptation identified in the NDCs are: food security and production  terrestrial and wetland ecosystems  freshwater resources  human health  and key economic sectors and services. 
An increasing number of countries are also prioritizing the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans to boost their efforts to adjust to a changing climate. These include building flood defences  setting up early warning systems for cyclones  or switching to drought-resistant crops. As of May 2021  125 of 154 developing countries were in the process of formulating and implementing national adaptation plans  and 22 countries have submitted their plans to the Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat. Developed countries are stepping up their efforts to provide technical guidance and support to LDCs  which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change to develop and carry out such plans.

  DespiThe global transition to a low-emission  climate-resilient future is backed up by increasing financial support
Climate finance provided by developed to developing countries continues to increase  reflecting an ongoing commitment to support the global transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient future. Total climate finance reported by Annex I Parties to the Paris Agreement reached an annual average of $48.7 billion in 20172018. This represents an increase of 10 per cent over 20152016. While over half of all climate-specific financial support for 20172018 was targeted at mitigation  the share of adaptation support is growing  and many countries are prioritizing adaptation in their provision of financial support. 
Two thirds of financial support provided in 20172018 (equivalent to an annual average of $32.3 billion) flowed through bilateral  regional and other channels  while the remaining third was channelled through multilateral institutions and funds  such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Support for the formulation of national adaptation plans through the GCF Readiness Programme is steadily increasing in all regions and groups. Eleven developing countries have submitted 23 project proposals to the GCF  of which 7  totalling $464 million  have been approved.
In 20172018  climate-specific support constituted the largest share of total climate finance ($36.2 billion). The share of core/general support (financial support provided to multilateral and bilateral institutions that is not considered climate-specific) has been decreasing over time  from over 40 per cent of the total in 20112012 to roughly 25 per cent in 20172018.
