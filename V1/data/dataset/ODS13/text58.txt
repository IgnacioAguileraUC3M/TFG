 As greenhouse gas levels continue to climb  climate change is occurring much faster than anticipated  and its effects are evident worldwide. The global mean temperature for 2018 was approximately 1C above the pre-industrial baseline  and the last four years have been the warmest on record. Sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate.
 Climate change is the defining issue of our time and the greatest challenge to sustainable development. Its compounding effects are speeding up its advance  leaving very little time to act if we want to prevent runaway climate change. Limiting global warming to 1.5C is necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and irreversible changes. That will require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy  land and urban infrastructure and industrial systems. 
 While countries have taken positive steps by preparing nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and increasing financing to combat climate change  far more ambitious plans and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society are required. Access to finance and the strengthening of resilience and adaptive capacity need to be scaled up at a much faster pace  particularly among LDCs and small island developing States.
