Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full commitment required for its reversal. The year 2019 was the second warmest on record and the end of the warmest decade (20102019)  bringing with it massive wildfires  hurricanes  droughts  floods and other climate disasters across continents. Global temperatures are on track to rise as much as 3.2C by the end of the century. To meet the 1.5C  or even the 2C  maximum target called for in the Paris Agreement  greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 per cent each year starting in 2020. However  despite the drastic reduction in human activity due to the COVID-19 crisis  the resulting 6 per cent drop in emissions projected for 2020 falls short of this target  and emissions are expected to rise as restrictions are lifted.
If the world does not act now  and forcefully  the catastrophic effects of climate change will be far greater than the current pandemic. Governments and businesses should use the lessons learned and opportunities arising from this crisis to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 20152030  redefine our relationship with the environment  and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to become low-greenhouse-gas emission and climate-resilient economies and societies.

  The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target  signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change  the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible  with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030  and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 20002018. Meanwhile  the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020  189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement  and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition  17 long-term strategies  18 national adaptation plans  and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020  parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones  with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic  which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide  offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.

  Financing for climate action has increased substantially  but it continues to be surpassed by investments in fossil fuels

      Global climate-related financial flows saw a 17 per cent rise from 20132014 to 20152016  from $584 billion to $681 billion. The spurt in growth was largely due to high levels of new private investment in renewable energy  which represents the largest segment in total climate-related flows. However  investments in climate activities across sectors continued to be surpassed by those related to fossil fuels in the energy sector  which totalled $781 billion in 2016. To achieve a low-carbon  climate-resilient transition  a much greater scale of annual investment is required.
    

      Climate-related financing provided by developed countries to developing countries increased by 14 per cent in 2016  reaching nearly $38 billion. Climate change mitigation remained the predominant focus  at $24.3 billion  followed by climate change adaptation ($5.6 billion) and cross-cutting issues ($5.1 billion).
    

  Most developing countries have begun to formulate plans to strengthen resilience and adapt to climate change
 National adaptation plans (NAPs) help countries achieve the global goal on adaptation under the Paris Agreement  namely  to enhance adaptive capacity  strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. In 2019  at least 120 of the 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement NAPs  an increase of 29 countries over the previous year. Eighteen countries  including five LDCs and four small island developing States  have completed and submitted their NAPs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat  while many others are at various stages in the process.
Funding for the formulation of NAPs is provided by the Green Climate Fund  through its Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme  and by the Least Developed Countries Fund. As of December 2019  81 countries had submitted 83 proposals totalling $203.8 million in requested support from the Green Climate Fund. Of these countries  29 (35 per cent) were LDCs. A total of 40 proposals had been approved  14 of them (35 per cent) from LDCs. Fewer proposals (12 as of 3 October) were submitted in 2019 than in previous years (22 in 2018 and 42 in 2017). Nine project proposals under the Least Developed Countries Fund were also approved to support the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

  Despite its glaring relevance  progress in meeting the 2020 disaster risk reduction target has been slow
Climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and severity of natural disasters  which affected more than 39 million people in 2018  resulting in deaths  disrupted livelihoods and economic losses. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 20152030 aims to reduce existing  and prevent new  disaster risk through clear targets and priorities for action  in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Target (e) of the Sendai Framework  which focuses on the establishment of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies  has a 2020 deadline. As of April 2020  85countries  slightly over 40 per cent  reportedthat they have national disaster risk reduction strategies aligned  to some extent  tothe Sendai Framework  with six of the countries reporting fully aligned national strategies. In 2018  55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had local disaster risk reduction strategies in line to some extent with national strategies. Countries are making vigorous efforts to address the risks of pandemics such as COVID-19 by integrating biohazard risk management into disaster risk reduction strategies at the national and local levels.
