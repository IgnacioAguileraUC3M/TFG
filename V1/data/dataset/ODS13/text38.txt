Of these  137 included an adaptation component. Some stressed that adaptation was their main priority  since they see the potential impacts of climate change as strongly linked to national development  sustainability and security. Parties referred to virtually every sector and area of the economy in the adaptation component of their INDCs. The top three priority areas were water  agriculture and health  which coincide with the top climate hazards that Parties identified  floods  drought and higher temperatures. Many parties also referred to vector- or water-borne diseases as a hazard that will require adaptation.
