The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full commitment required for its reversal. The year 2019 was the second warmest on record and the end of the warmest decade (20102019)  bringing with it massive wildfires  hurricanes  droughts  floods and other climate disasters across continents. Global temperatures are on track to rise as much as 3.2C by the end of the century. To meet the 1.5C  or even the 2C  maximum target called for in the Paris Agreement  greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 per cent each year starting in 2020. However  despite the drastic reduction in human activity due to the COVID-19 crisis  the resulting 6 per cent drop in emissions projected for 2020 falls short of this target  and emissions are expected to rise as restrictions are lifted.
If the world does not act now  and forcefully  the catastrophic effects of climate change will be far greater than the current pandemic. Governments and businesses should use the lessons learned and opportunities arising from this crisis to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 20152030  redefine our relationship with the environment  and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to become low-greenhouse-gas emission and climate-resilient economies and societies.
