In 2020  social and economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 lowered energy demand around the world. As a result  global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions declined by 5.2 per cent in 2020  the equivalent of almost 2 billion metric tons  the largest decline ever and almost five times greater than the 2009 drop following the global financial crisis. But it was only a temporary reprieve. With the phasing out of COVID-related restrictions  demand for coal  oil and gas increased. Consequently  energy-related CO2 emissions for 2021 rose by 6 per cent  reaching their highest level ever and completely wiping out the pandemic-related reduction seen in 2020.
