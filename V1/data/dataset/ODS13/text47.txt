Since mortality is often concentrated in very intensive disasters  it is difficult to perceive trends over relatively short periods of time. However  data on smaller-scale disasters show a statistically significant trend towards increasing mortality in events with fewer than 100 deaths. A similar study taking into consideration population growth also showed an upward trend. Disaster mortality reflects not only exposure to hazards  but also a confluence of other vulnerability factors  such as poor urban management  environmental degradation  lack of disaster preparedness  and poverty and inequality. Moreover  these underlying risk factors are responsible for most morbidity resulting from natural hazards  and tend to affect low-income households and communities and small businesses disproportionally. The data suggest that an increased focus on disaster risk reduction is a prudent investment for saving lives.
