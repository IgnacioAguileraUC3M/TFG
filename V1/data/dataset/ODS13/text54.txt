
In 2017  atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 405.5 parts per million (ppm) (up from 400.1 ppm in 2015)  representing 146 per cent of preindustrial levels. To limit global warming to 1.5C means that emissions will need to peak as soon as possible  followed by rapid reductions. Global carbon emissions need to fall by a staggering 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels and continue at a steep decline to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
 As of May 2019  186 Parties had ratified the Paris Agreement. Parties to the agreement are expected to prepare  communicate and maintain successive NDCs (including targets  policies and actions planned in response to climate change). As of that same date  183 Parties (182 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first NDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat  and one Party had communicated its second NDC. Parties have been requested to update their existing NDCs or communicate new ones by 2020. To achieve the 2030 objectives  countries will need to be far more ambitious in preparing their new NDCs for submission.
