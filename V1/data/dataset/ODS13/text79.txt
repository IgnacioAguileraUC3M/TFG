Developed countries have jointly committed to mobilizing $100 billion dollars per year by 2020  further extended to 2025  for climate action in developing countries. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  developed countries have likely fallen short of that promise. Climate finance provided and mobilized by developed countries totalled $79.6 billion in 2019  up from $78.3 billion in 2018. Forward-looking scenarios by the OECD estimate that the $100 billion target will not be met until 2023.
While the $100 billion annual commitment is considered the bedrock of international climate finance  it is far below estimates put forth by the IPCC. The IPCC has estimated that $1.6 trillion to $3.8 trillion will be needed each year through 2050 for the world to transition to a low-carbon future and avoid warming exceeding 1.5C.
