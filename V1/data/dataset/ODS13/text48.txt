Over the last decade  countries have made progress in managing the worst impacts of disasters  mainly by developing institutions and policies for disaster risk reduction and strengthening capacity for disaster preparedness  response and early warning. That said  progress has been limited in tackling the underlying drivers of disaster riskpoverty  poor urban planning and land use  weak environmental and resource management  and climate change. Countries have thus begun implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies that also address these risk factors. Of 96 countries that reported data  all used environmental impact assessments as a mechanism to address such factors. However  only 51 countries used payment for ecosystem services as a mechanism  which is known to promote better land management and the protection of ecological services.
