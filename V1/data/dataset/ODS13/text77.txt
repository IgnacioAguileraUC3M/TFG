In 2020  concentrations of global greenhouse gases reached new highs  and real-time data point to continued increases. As these concentrations rise  so does the Earths temperature. In 2021  the global mean temperature was about 1.11  0.13 C above the pre-industrial level (from 1850 to 1900)  making it one of the seven warmest years on record (2015 to 2021).
While variations in global temperatures from year on year are to be expected  the long-term trend is a warming climate. With rising temperatures  the world is experiencing more and more extreme weather events. This translates into melting ice caps and glaciers  intense heat and rainfall as well as sea-level rise and other potentially cataclysmic events  with adverse social and economic consequences. Such extremes could be seen on every continent in 2021: record-shattering temperatures in Canada  deadly flooding in Europe and Asia  and drought in parts of Africa and South America. The global annual mean temperature is projected to rise beyond 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels in at least one of the next five years  edging precipitously closer to the lower target of the Paris Agreement.
