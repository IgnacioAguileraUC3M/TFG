 An important development objective for many countries is easing inequality and addressing social inclusion. One indicator of relative poverty and inequality is the share of people living below 50 per cent of the median income level. An analysis of data from 110 high- and low-income countries showed that the median country had 14 per cent of the population with income levels below that threshold. The most unequal country had 26 per cent below that threshold  and the most equal country had 3 per cent. But both rich and poor countries have high and low levels of inequality. Income inequality is not strongly correlated with either poverty or affluence  suggesting that policies promoting equality and inclusivity have universal relevance. 

      Countries with a high proportion of non-performing loans need to attend to the health of their banking systems
    
 The stability of a countrys financial system is key to efficiently allocating resources  managing risks  and ensuring that macroeconomic objectives that benefit all are met. One measure of financial stability is the share of non-performing loans in relation to total loans to depositors in a banking system. An analysis of 138 countries from 2010 to 2017 showed that  in half of the countries  non-performing loans made up less than 5 per cent of total loans. In 2017  more than one quarter of the countries showed a higher percentage of non-performing loans (10 per cent or more)  and four countries showed a proportion higher than 30 per cent. A high proportion of non-performing loans usually affects profitability and undermines the broader business environment  which can have consequences for economic growth  unemployment and other factors affecting inequality.
