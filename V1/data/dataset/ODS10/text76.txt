Others have a more complex decision-making mechanism in place. For example  in both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation (both part of the World Bank Group)  the voting shares of developing countries remain far below their membership levels and have not increased much over the past 16 years. Other organizations  such as the International Monetary Fund (through its recent quota reform) and the Financial Stability Board  have increased the voting shares of developing countries during this period. However  more work needs to be done to ensure that the voices and participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making  norm-setting and global economic governance are broadened and strengthened.
