The spread of COVID-19 has intensified structural and systemic discrimination and pervasive inequalities  which harm millions of people and hold back every society. Addressing discrimination through evidence-based policies allows societies to transform into more inclusive  equal  resilient  just and sustainable systems anchored in human rights.
Roughly one in five people have experienced discrimination on at least one of the grounds prohibited under international human rights law  according to data from 49 countries and territories collected between 2017 and 2021. In countries where disaggregated data are available  women are more than twice as likely as men to experience discrimination on the grounds of sex. Moreover  women living in urban areas are slightly more likely to experience discrimination than their rural counterparts. Among persons with disabilities  it is pervasive  with about one third reporting personal experiences of discrimination.
