 Inequality within and among countries is a persistent cause for concern  despite progress in some areas. Income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world  even as the poorest 40 per cent of the population in most countries experience income growth. Greater focus is needed to reduce income and other inequalities  including those related to labour market access and trade. Specifically  additional efforts are needed to further increase zero-tariff access for exports from poorer countries  and to provide technical assistance to LDCs and small island developing States seeking to benefit from preferential trade status.
