 Even with mobility restrictions on borders around the world due to COVID-19  tens of thousands of people continue to leave their homes and embark on dangerous journeys across deserts and seas. In 2020  4 186 deaths and disappearances were recorded on migratory routes worldwide. Though this is fewer than in previous years  some routes saw an increase in fatalities. Most notably  at least 849 people died en route to the Canary Islands in 2020  compared with 210 recorded in 2019 and 45 in 2018. The true number of deaths globally may be higher  as the pandemic has increased the challenges to collecting this data. The latest figures show that  as of 2019  just 54 per cent of countries had a comprehensive set of policy measures to facilitate orderly  safe  regular and responsible migration and mobility of people  based on the 111 countries with available data. 

      Income inequality has been going down since the 2008 global financial crisis; the pandemic could reverse that trend
    
 The Gini index is one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It ranges between 0 and 100  where 0 indicates that income is shared equally among all people  and 100 indicates the extreme situation where one person accounts for all income. Prior to COVID-19  the average Gini index for emerging market and developing countries had been falling. However  the World Economic Outlook  October 2020 of the International Monetary Fund estimates that COVID-19 will increase the average Gini index for these countries by 2.6 points to 42.7 (a 6 per cent increase). This will reverse the fall in inequality since the global financial crisis in 2008. For low-income countries  the impact is projected to be even larger  despite the fact that those countries made less progress in reducing inequality since 2008.
