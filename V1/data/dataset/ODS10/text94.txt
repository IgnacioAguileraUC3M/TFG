
 Leaving no one behind means that those with lower incomes are able to benefit and participate in a countrys broader economic growth. Progress towards shared prosperity can be measured through the growth of household income (or consumption) of the poorest 40 per cent of a countrys population. In 73 of the 90 countries with comparable data during the period 2012 to 2017  this group experienced real income growth. Furthermore  in more than half of those countries (49)  the bottom 40 per cent experienced income growth higher than the overall national average  indicating lower levels of inequality. Still  in all countries with data  the bottom 40 per cent of the population received less than 25 per cent of the overall income  while the richest 10 per cent received at least 20 per cent of total income. 
Progress in shared prosperity has been strongest in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  with the bottom 40 per cent of the population growing annually by 4.9 per cent  on average. Growth in sub-Saharan African countries has been more limited  although comparison is challenging due to limited data (available for 15 countries only). The need for improved data collection is particularly pertinent now  so that countries are able to identify and take action if the poorest are disproportionately affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19.
