 Almost two in ten people reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one of the grounds established by international human rights law  according to data from 31 countries over the period 2014 to 2019. Moreover  women are more likely to be victims of discrimination than men. Among those with disabilities  3 in 10 personally experienced discrimination  with higher levels still among women with disabilities. The main grounds of discrimination mentioned by these women was not the disability itself  but religion  ethnicity and sex  pointing to the urgent need for measures to tackle multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic may further entrench existing patterns of discrimination and stigma  with reports emerging from many countries of discrimination against different groups. 

      Workers are receiving a smaller share of the output they helped produce
    
 In 2017  the labour income of the worlds workers represented an estimated 51 per cent of global GDP. The labour share of GDP takes into account the employment-related earnings of both employees and the self-employed  and provides an indication of whether higher national income will lead to increased material living standards for workers. The global labour income share has shown a downward trend since 2004  when it stood at 54 per cent  implying that workers are receiving a smaller proportion of the output they helped produce. 
The labour income share varies considerably from one region to the other. In 2017  the labour income of workers in Northern Africa and Western Asia accounted for a little over a third of the regions output (36 per cent). At the other end of the spectrum  the labour income share was close to 58 per cent in Europe and Northern America.
