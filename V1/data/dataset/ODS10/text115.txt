 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating global income inequality. As a result  the steady progress over the last two decades is now in jeopardy. Projections suggest that between-country inequality rose by 1.2 per cent between 2017 and 2021  the first such increase in a generation. Before the pandemic  inequality was expected to have fallen by 2.6 per cent over the same period. 
 Forecasts suggest that income inequality within countries will also have increased in emerging market and developing countries. Although the magnitude of this increase is expected to be relatively small  around 1 per cent  on average  it halts the steady decline in income inequality seen in these countries since the start of the millennium. Worse yet  this increase may become entrenched  since pandemic-induced disruptions to education and the disproportionate adverse effects on low-income households may worsen intergenerational mobility. Meanwhile  high inflation and surging public debt levels may hamper countries' ability to support these vulnerable groups.
