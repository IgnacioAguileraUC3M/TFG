 The share of national income that goes to labour is one indication of whether economic growth will translate into higher incomes for workers over time. Increased national income can lead to improved living standards  but that depends on its distribution across aspects of production  including labour  capital and land.
 Globally  the share of national income going to labour has shown a downward trend since 2004. That means that the share of national output used to remunerate workers has declined. The decrease was temporarily reversed during the global financial crisis of 20082009 due to a sudden contraction in GDP. Central and Southern Asia and Europe and Northern America were the main drivers of the declining global labour share. Between 2004 and 2017  the adjusted labour share of GDP decreased by more than 5 percentage points in Central and Southern Asia (from 51.2 to 45.8 per cent) and close to 2 percentage points in Europe and Northern America (from 59.6 to 57.6 per cent). Conversely  in Latin America and the Caribbean  the labour income share increased from 48.4 to 50.5 per cent during the same period.
