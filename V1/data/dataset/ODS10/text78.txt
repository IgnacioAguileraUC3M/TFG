In 2015  global total resource flows for development to developing countries totalled just over 319 billion current US dollars. The contraction in 2015 was largely due to a steep decline in private resource flows. Least developed and landlocked developing countries received more than 10 per cent of all total resource flows for development in 2015  a continuation of consistent increases over the last 15 years. The region that received the largest share of total resource flows was Latin America and the Caribbean (a little over 100 billion US dollars)  while flows to Eastern and South-Eastern Asia fell from about 80 billion US dollars in 2010 to about 50 billion US dollars in 2015.
