In most countries whose per capita income/consumption grew during this period  growth was faster for the bottom 40 per cent of the population. In contrast  in most countries with contractions in per capita income/consumption  the bottom 40 per cent fared worse than the overall population. This suggests that those in the bottom 40 per cent are particularly vulnerable to economic changes  and that sustained income growth overall is necessary to reduce inequality and ensure shared prosperity.
