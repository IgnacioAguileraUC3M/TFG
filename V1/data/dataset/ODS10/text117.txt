 Labour income data are key to understanding inequality. Measuring labour's contribution to GDP provides an indication of whether higher national income will lead to increased material living standards for workers. While employment is the main source of income for many workers  income derived from capital disproportionately benefits the affluent. Therefore  a decline in the labour share of income from 2014 to 2019  from 54.1 per cent to 52.6 per cent  represents upward pressure on inequality. This drop is consistent with other related evidence going back to the 1970s  suggesting that workers are losing relative earning power over the long term. 
As a region  Europe and Northern America is driving the decline in the labour income share  given its weight in overall global income. Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Central and Southern Asia have also experienced significant declines. On a more positive note  data from sub-Saharan Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean  and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia showed increases in the labour income share  though these increases are typically occurring from a lower starting point.
