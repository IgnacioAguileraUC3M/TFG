Progress in reducing inequality within and among countries has been mixed. Income inequality has declined in many of the countries that experienced sustained economic growth  while increasing in countries with negative growth.

And  while remittances can be a lifeline for families and communities in the home countries of international migrant workers  the high cost of transferring money continues to diminish the benefits.
