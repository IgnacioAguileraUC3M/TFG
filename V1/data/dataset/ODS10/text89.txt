 The majority of countries have policies that facilitate the orderly  safe  regular and responsible migration and mobility of people. Yet significant differences can be found across the six policy domains of this indicator. For each domain  more than half of the 105 countries with available data have a comprehensive set of policy measures  meaning that they reported having migration policy measures for 80 per cent or more of the subcategories of each domain. Migrant rights and socioeconomic well-being are the areas demonstrating the largest policy gaps  with over 40 per cent of countries lacking a comprehensive set of measures in those domains. Policies to promote cooperation and partnerships and to facilitate safe  orderly and regular migration are the most widespread  with more than three quarters of countries reporting a wide range of such measures.
