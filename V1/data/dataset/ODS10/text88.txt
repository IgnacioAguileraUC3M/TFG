 Duty-free access continued to increase for exports from LDCs  small island developing States and developing regions at large. LDCs saw the biggest benefits: coverage of duty-free treatment increased by 5.5 percentage points between 2016 and 2017  reaching 65.6 per cent of all products exported. About 51 per cent of exports from developing regions have now become eligible for duty-free treatment. 
 At the sector level  improvements in the treatment of LDCs were primarily due to growing duty-free access for agricultural and industrial products (increases of 7.3 and 5.4 percentage points  respectively). However  such access for LDCs and other developing countries is not automatic at customs checkpoints. Exporters need to comply with rules-of-origin certification processes to benefit from preferential treatment. Those procedures can be costly and time-consuming for small- and medium-sized enterprises  lowering their incentive to apply for preferential treatment.
