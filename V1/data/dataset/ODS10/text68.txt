Over this period  the labour share of GDP only increased in Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean  where it was at 48 and 52 per cent  respectively in 2015. Eastern Asia saw flat growth of labour share of GDP and continues to maintain the highest share in the world at 61.4 per cent of GDP. While the labour share of GDP fell from almost 58 per cent in 2000 to just over 55 per cent in 2015 for developed regions  developing regions experienced a slight improvement to 55 per cent. Stagnating wages across all regions contributed significantly to these results.
