The comparative advantage of LDCs in duty-free access varied depending on the product groups: almost all agricultural products from LDCs (98 per cent) were exempted from duties by developed countries versus 74 per cent of products from developing countries. The relative advantage for LDCs was even greater for textiles and clothing: rates for both product groups were around 70 per cent for LDCs; for developing countries  the rates were 41 per cent for textiles and 34 per cent for clothing.
