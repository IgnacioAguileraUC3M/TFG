In 56 out of 94 countries with data for the period 20072012  the per capita income of the poorest 40 per cent of households grew more rapidly than the national average. This was especially true in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Asia  where 88 per cent and 67 per cent of countries  respectively  saw gains for the poorest 40 per cent of households. That said  faster growth for the poorest does not necessarily imply greater prosperity  since nine of the 56 countries experienced negative income growth rates over this period.
