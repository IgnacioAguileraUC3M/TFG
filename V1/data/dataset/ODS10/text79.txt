On average  post offices and money transfer operators charge over 6 per cent of the amount remitted; commercial banks charge 11 per cent; and the global average cost of transferring money is just over 7 per cent  according to World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide. While the cost of sending money has declined gradually since 2008  all three of these remittance services providers charge significantly more than the 3 per cent target. New and improved technologies  such as prepaid cards and mobile operators  charge lower fees for sending money home (between 2 per cent and 4 per cent)  but are not yet widely available or used in many remittance corridors. These new technologies may help reduce the cost of sending remittances to some of the poorest countries  where costs tend to be highest. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa  where average costs absorb about 10 per cent of the amount sent.
