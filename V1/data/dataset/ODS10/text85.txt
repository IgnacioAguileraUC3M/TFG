 To gauge whether the poorest people in a country are participating in economic progress  it is useful to compare the growth of household income (or consumption) of the poorest 40 per cent with that of the population as a whole. That provides one indication of whether overall prosperity is being shared with the bottom 40 per cent of the income ladder in a country. 
 In 92 countries with comparable data over the period 2011 to 2016  the results were mixed. In 69 countries  the poorest 40 per cent saw their income grow  but with large variations among countries. In 50 of those 69 countries  income growth in the poorest 40 per cent of the population was faster than the national average. Notably  however  the bottom 40 per cent still received less than 25 per cent of overall income. In many countries  an increasing share of income goes to the top 1 per cent. 
 Data measuring household income for that analysis were limited. Only 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had data on income growth for the most recent period. That points to the ongoing need for improved data collection and statistical capacity-building  especially in the poorest countries.
