They also contribute to the development of their countries of origin and destination through their work and through the remittances they send home. Total remittances to developing countries increased slightly in 2015 to 431.6 billion US dollars (up 0.4 per cent from 2014)  but the cost of sending money across international borders remains high. Even though the cost declined from 2012 to 2015  it still averaged 7.5 per cent of the amount remitted in 2015  more than double the target rate of 3 per cent.
