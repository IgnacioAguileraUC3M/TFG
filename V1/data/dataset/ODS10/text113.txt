Large numbers of migrants lost their lives last year on sometimes treacherous migratory routes 
 Last year  5 895 people died fleeing their countries via various  sometimes dangerous  routes. This surpasses pre-pandemic figures and makes 2021 the deadliest year on record for migrants since 2017  according to the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project. The widespread impact of the pandemic forced many people seeking safety  reunification with family  decent work and better opportunities to take risky migratory routes. 
At least 3 411 people died on maritime and land routes to and through Europe in 2021 - the majority of migration-related fatalities recorded worldwide. On the overseas route in the Atlantic towards Spain's Canary Islands  nearly 1 180 deaths were recorded  the most fatalities on this route since data collection began in 2014. It was also the deadliest year on record for migrants along the border between the United States and Mexico  where at least 717 people died  51 per cent more than in 2020.
