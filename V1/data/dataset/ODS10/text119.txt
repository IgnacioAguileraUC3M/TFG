Before the COVID-19 crisis  encouraging signs across a number of indicators suggested that income inequality was narrowing. In many countries  for instance  the incomes of the poorest people rose faster than the national average  though inequalities in other areas persisted. Now  the effects of the pandemic appear to be reversing any positive trends. Those with relatively low incomes are at risk of falling behind. The pandemic has also intensified structural and systemic discrimination. Emerging markets and developing economies are experiencing slow recoveries  widening disparities in income between countries. The number of refugees worldwide reached the highest absolute number on record in 2021; sadly  that year also saw a record number of migrant deaths. Meanwhile  the war in Ukraine rages on  forcing even more people from their homes and creating one of the largest refugee crises in recent memory.
