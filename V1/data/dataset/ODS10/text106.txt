 Measuring the share of the population living below 50 per cent of the national median income is useful for monitoring the level and trends in social inclusion  relative poverty and inequality within a country. If the median grows over time  while the share of the population living below 50 per cent of the median increases  this means the poorest are falling behind in relative terms. The latest estimates show that in some countries  as much as 25 per cent of the population live on less than half the median income. On average  13 per cent of people experience relative low income across the 104 countries with available data  although considerable differences are observed among regions. In countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  almost one in five people live on less than half their national median income  on average  although some progress has been made in many countries since 2010. Around 9 per cent of people live on less than half the national median in countries in Central and Southern Asia  the lowest level among all regions.
