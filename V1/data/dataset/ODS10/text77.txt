From 2005 to 2015  the proportion of tariff lines globally with duty-free treatment for products originating in developing countries increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent; for products originating in the least developed countries  the proportion rose from 49 per cent to 65 per cent. These increases indicate that the international community is continuing its efforts to grant preferential treatment to countries with lower income levels.
