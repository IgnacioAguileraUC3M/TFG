 Health and care workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This has further constrained the delivery of essential health services  especially for countries with a limited health workforce. According to data from 20132019  the density of nursing and midwifery personnel in Northern America is over 150 per 10 000 people  over 15 times that of sub-Saharan Africa and 8 times that of Northern Africa and Southern Asia. The density of medical doctors in Northern America  Oceania and Central Asia is around 25 per 10 000 people  compared with 2 per 10 000 in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In performing their jobs  health and care workers are at risk of COVID-19 exposure: national COVID-19 surveillance data reported to WHO indicated that health and care workers comprised 10 per cent of all new COVID-19 cases in the earlier months of the pandemic. Health and care workers face challenging working and psychosocial conditions related to COVID-19  including  stigma and discrimination  lack of personal protective equipment  strike actions  quarantine and self-isolation.
