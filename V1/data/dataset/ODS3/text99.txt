      Mental disorders  including depression  can lead to suicide. Nearly 800 000 suicides occurred in 2015  representing an annual global rate of 11 per 100 000 people. Men are about two times more likely to die by suicide than women: men had a suicide mortality rate of 14 per 100 000 in 2015 versus 8 per 100 000 for women.
  

    Gender disparities in suicide extend across all regions  with the largest relative gap observed in Europe and Northern America as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean. In these regions  men are almost four times as likely to die by suicide as women. In contrast  the gender gap in in Central and Southern Asia as well as in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia is much smaller  owing to the significantly higher suicide rates among women in those two regions. Worldwide  suicide is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women between the ages of 15 and 29.
