COVID-19 is now a leading cause of death. The latest estimates suggest that 14.9 million people died as a direct result of COVID-19 or from the pandemics impact on health systems and society in 2020 and 2021.  This estimate is nearly triple as the 5.4 million officially reported COVID-19 deaths in the same period.  About 84 per cent of these excess deaths are concentrated in South-East Asia  Europe and the Americas (as defined by WHO)  and 68 per cent are in just 10 countries.
The pandemic has severely disrupted health systems and essential health services. Interruptions in essential health services were reported in 92 per cent of 129 countries surveyed at the end of 2021. These disruptions were found across all major areas of health  including maternal and child health  immunization  mental health programmes  and treatment of diseases such as HIV  hepatitis  TB and malaria. As a result  impressive strides in global life expectancy came to a sudden halt. In many parts of the world  life expectancy has fallen by one to two years.
To effectively curb the spread of COVID-19 and prevent tens of thousands of additional deaths  it is critical to ensure equitable access to safe and effective vaccines. WHO has called for 70 per cent of people in all countries to receive vaccinations by mid-2022. That said  global vaccine distribution is far from equitable. As of May 2022  only around 17 per cent of people in low-income countries had received at least one dose of a vaccine  compared with more than 80 per cent in high-income countries. For everyones health  it is imperative that all countries and relevant manufacturers suspend patents  prioritize vaccine supply to COVAX  and create the conditions necessary for the local production of tests  vaccines and treatments.
