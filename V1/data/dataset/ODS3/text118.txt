Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. Maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced  life expectancy continues to increase globally  and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady progress. In the case of other diseases  however  progress has slowed or stalled  including global efforts to eradicate malaria and tuberculosis. Far too many deaths occurred because trained health workers or routine interventions  such as immunizations  were not available. In fact  at least half the worlds population  many of whom suffer financial hardship  are still without access to essential health services. In rich and poor countries alike  a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty. 
Concerted efforts are required on these and other fronts to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases  including mental health; and tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health  such as air pollution and the lack of safely managed water and sanitation.
