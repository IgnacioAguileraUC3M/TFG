
 Inadequate water  sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent of the disease burden from diarrhoea  100 per cent of the burden from infection through soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms)  and 16 per cent of the burden owing to malnutrition (burden is understood as being the impact of a health problem as measured by financial cost  mortality  morbidity or other indicators). These three conditions led to a total of 870 000 deaths in 2016. This large disease burden could be significantly reduced if safely managed drinking water and sanitation services were universally available  and good hygiene practices were followed. 
 Both household and ambient air pollution increase the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases  and are major risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Exposure to household air pollution  mainly due to polluting fuels and technologies for cooking  led to around 4 million deaths in 2016. Health risks from this type of pollution are particularly high among women and children  who typically spend the most time around the stove. Ambient air pollution from traffic  industry  power-generation  waste-burning and residential fuel combustion resulted in around 4.2 million deaths in 2016.
