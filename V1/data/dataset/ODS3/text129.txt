
 In 2019  166 countries reported on their preparedness to detect  report on and respond to health emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic through the implementation of the International Health Regulations. Analysis shows steady progress since 2018 in almost every core capacity except for human resources  which is unchanged at 63 per cent. Although more work remains in most areas  the 2019 reports provided clear evidence of the strong political commitment to fulfil obligations under the International Health Regulations. They also showed that continuing efforts are needed to improve and maintain early warning systems and to mitigate and manage public-health risks within the national context. The current experience with the COVID-19 crisis has further highlighted the need for strengthening emergency preparedness as well as for rapidly scaling up response capacities and increasing multisectoral and international collaboration.
