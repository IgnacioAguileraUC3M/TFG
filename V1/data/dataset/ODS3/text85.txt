    Between 1990 and 2015  the global maternal mortality ratio declined by 44 per cent to an estimated 216 deaths per 100 000 live births  falling short of the MDGs and far from the target of 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births established in the 2030 Agenda. Almost all maternal deaths occur in low-resource settings and can be prevented  including by expanding access to appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. Globally in 2015  approximately three in four women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who were married or in a union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods. Only three in four births took place with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant.
    

    The global under-5 mortality rate declined by more than half to 43 per 1 000 live births from 1990 to 2015. This was short of the two-thirds reduction envisaged in the MDGs. In 2015  an estimated 5.9 million children under age 5 died; most of these deaths were preventable. Over this period  progress in child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result  a growing share of all under-5 deaths occurs in the first month of life (45 per cent in 2015).
