
After more than a decade of steady gains against malaria  progress has stalled. No significant advances were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide from 2015 to 2017. The incidence rate of malaria declined by 18 per cent between 2010 and 2015 from 72 cases per 1 000 people at risk to 59 and then remained unchanged from 2015 to 2017.
 In 2017  an estimated 219 million cases of malaria and 435 000 deaths from the disease were reported. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest burden  accounting for more than 90 per cent of global malaria cases  and the toll is rising. From 2016 to 2017  approximately 3.5 million more malaria cases were reported in the 10 most affected African countries. Children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable to the disease  and account for 61 per cent (266 000) of malaria deaths worldwide. Funding for malaria had been increasing since 2000  but recently stalled. Increased support directed to the most affected countries is urgently needed.
