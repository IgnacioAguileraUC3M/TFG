The probability of dying from any of the four main non-communicable diseases  cardiovascular disease  cancer  diabetes and chronic respiratory disease  between the ages of 30 and 70 declined from 22 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent in 2010 and to 18 per cent in 2016. Slow progress is mainly due to an overall shortage of services within and outside health systems to prevent and treat non-communicable diseases. In 2016  71 per cent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to non-communicable diseases; of these  85 per cent of the 15 million premature deaths (before age 70) occurred in low- and middle-income countries. People with pre-existing non-communicable diseases are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the coronavirus. However  prevention and treatment services for non-communicable diseases have been severely disrupted since the COVID-19 pandemic began  with low-income countries most affected. Many people are not receiving the health services and medicines they need. Key actions are therefore urgently required  including essential care for acute  life-threatening conditions.
