       COVID-19 and associated disruptions have caused more children to miss out on essential vaccines. From 2019 to 2020  coverage of infant immunization slipped from 86 to 83 per cent. This means that 22.7 million children missed out on vaccinations in 2020  3.7 million more than in 2019 and the highest number since 2005. In addition  17.1 million older children did not receive vaccines through the routine immunization programme in 2020  an increase from 13.6 million in 2019.

         The consequences could be devastasting. Measles  for example  is a highly contagious disease  and the current coverage levels of 70 per cent with two doses are insufficient to prevent illness  disability and death from measles outbreaks or complications associated with the disease. Whats more  COVID-19 responses and vaccinations have diverted health system resources away from other essential services. It is therefore likely that in 2021 and beyond  too many children will continue to miss out on immunization as well as other health-care services. Recovering these to pre-pandemic levels must be an urgent global priority.
