      Preventing unintended pregnancy through universal access to family planning is critical to further improvement in the health and well-being of women and children. Based on estimates  in 2017  78 per cent of girls and women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) worldwide who are married or in union have their need for family planning satisfied through modern contraceptive methods. This global average masks wide regional disparities: in 2017  an estimated half of women married or in union in sub-Saharan Africa and in Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand  who have need for family planning are not using modern contraceptive methods. In sub-Saharan Africa  at least  this still represents substantial progress: since 2000  an additional 19 per cent of women married or in union have had their need for family planning satisfied through modern methods.
