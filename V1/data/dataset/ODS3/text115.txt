
 Strengthening primary health care and achieving health for all requires an adequate workforce that is motivated  supported and available where needed. Sadly  this is far from the reality. Available data from 2013 to 2018 indicate that close to 40 per cent of all countries have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people  and around 58 per cent of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people. This is only a slight improvement from 2010 to 2015. 
 Evidence shows that health workers are unevenly distributed across the globe and even within countries. Not surprisingly  regions with the highest burden of disease have the lowest proportion of health workers to deliver services. All of the least developed countries have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people  and 98 per cent have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people. It is estimated that around 18 million additional health workers will be needed globally by 2030 to ensure healthy lives for all.
