      Halving the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase (90 per cent) in the number of vehicles registered between 2000 and 2013 worldwide. In 2013  1.25 million people died as a result of road traffic injuries  an increase of 13 per cent since 2000. This rise  which is small relative to the increase in the number of vehicles on the road  points to the effectiveness of interventions to improve global road safety.
  

    From 2000 to 2013  the rate of road traffic deaths decreased in Australia and New Zealand  Europe and Northern America as well as sub-Saharan Africa  and increased in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest rate  at 27 deaths per 100 000 people in 2013  compared to 17 deaths per 100 000 people globally. The road traffic mortality rate is lowest in Australia and New Zealand (5 deaths per 100 000 people)  followed by Europe and Northern America and Europe  at 9 deaths per 100 000 people.
