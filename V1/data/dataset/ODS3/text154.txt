COVID-19 continues to pose challenges to peoples health and well-being globally and is impeding progress in meeting Goal 3 targets. Before the pandemic  gains were evident in many areas of health  including reproductive  maternal and child health  immunization coverage and treatment of communicable diseases  though progress was marred by huge regional disparities. As of mid-2022  COVID-19 had infected more than 500 million people worldwide. The latest estimates show that global excess deaths directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19 could have been as high as 15 million by the end of 2021. The pandemic has severely disrupted essential health services  triggered an increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression  lowered global life expectancy  derailed progress towards ending HIV  tuberculosis (TB) and malaria  and halted two decades of work towards making health coverage universal. As a result  immunization coverage dropped for the first time in 10 years  and deaths from TB and malaria increased. Urgent and concerted action is needed to set the world back on a trajectory towards achieving Goal 3.
