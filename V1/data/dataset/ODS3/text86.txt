      The incidence of HIV  malaria and tuberculosis declined globally between 2000 and 2015  indicating that MDG 6 was achieved. Ending these epidemics  however  will require reinvigorated efforts. In 2015  the number of new HIV infections globally was 0.3 per 1 000 uninfected people  and an estimated 2.1 million people became newly infected that year. The incidence of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa  with 1.5 new cases per 1 000 uninfected people. In 2014  9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 per 100 000 people) were reported worldwide  with 58 per cent of them in South-Eastern Asia and the Western Pacific. Almost half of the worlds population is at risk of malaria and  in 2015  the incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1 000 people at risk  an estimated 214 million cases. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases worldwide  with an incidence rate of 235 per 1 000 people at risk.
