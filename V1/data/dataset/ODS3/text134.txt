
As of June 2021  total reported deaths from COVID-19 reached 3.7 million globally. Europe and Northern America experienced the largest loss at close to 1.7 million  followed by Latin America and the Caribbean at about 1.2 million  and Central and Southern Asia at slightly under half a million.
For those who survived the virus  COVID-19 may have lingering health effects  including long-term disability due to lung scarring and heart damage  along with mental health issues that could affect individuals for a prolonged period. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics during the pandemic could further increase antimicrobial resistance. Although it is still too early for existing data to reflect this impact  the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse years of progress towards improved worldwide health. Evidence from countries with reliable and timely vital statistics indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has sharply shortened life expectancy.
