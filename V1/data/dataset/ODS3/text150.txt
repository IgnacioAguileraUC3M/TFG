Globally  in 20152021  an estimated 84 per cent of births were assisted by skilled health professionals  including medical doctors  nurses and midwives. This was an increase from 77 per cent in 20082014. Still  coverage in sub-Saharan Africa was 20 percentage points lower than the global average.
Progress was also made in under-5 and neonatal mortality  though too many children are still dying. The global mortality rate of children under age 5 fell by 14 per cent from 2015 to 2020  from 43 to 37 deaths per 1 000 live births. Similarly  the mortality rate of children in their first 28 days of life  the neonatal period  fell by 12 per cent over that same period  from 19 to 17 deaths per 1 000 live births. Even with this progress  5 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday in 2020 alone  down from 5.9 million in 2015. Almost half of those deaths  2.4 million  occurred in the first month of life. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rate in the world at 74 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2020. This is 14 times higher than the risk for children in Europe and Northern America.
The adolescent birth rate also fell worldwide. From 2010 to 2020  the rate dropped from 47.9 births to 41.2 births per 1 000 adolescents aged 15 to 19. The largest declines occurred in Central and Southern Asia  from 43.6 births to 23.7 births over the same period.
Childbearing among girls aged 10 to 14 is much more common in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean than in other parts of the world. Most countries with measurable levels of early childbearing have recorded a reduction since 2000.
Although data to assess the total impact of COVID-19 on maternal and child health and adolescent fertility are not yet available  concern is mounting that the pandemic has inadvertently undermined achievement in those areas.
