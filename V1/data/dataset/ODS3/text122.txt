Ensuring that all births are assisted by a skilled attendant is part of a proven strategy for reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Globally  81 per cent of births were assisted by skilled health professionals during 20142019  up from 64 per cent in 20002005  with many regions achieving almost universal coverage. Despite this progress  only 60 per cent of all births were assisted by skilled attendants in sub-Saharan Africa and 77 per cent in Southern Asia. Moreover  sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see a 15 per cent rise in annual births between 2019 and 2030. Assuming current coverage stays the same  an estimated 17 million births in sub-Saharan Africa will not be attended by a skilled provider in 2030.
Meeting the demand for family planning with modern contraceptive methods also contributes to improving maternal and child health by preventing unintended and closely spaced pregnancies. Globally  the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods increased slightly  from 75.7 per cent in 2010 to 76.8 per cent in 2020. Despite progress in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade  only 55.5 per cent of the regions women who want to prevent pregnancy are using modern contraceptives. Globally  more than 250 million women have an unmet demand for modern contraceptives.
A steady decline has been observed worldwide in the adolescent birth rate. It fell from 48 births annually per 1 000 women aged 15 to 19 years in 2010 to 45 in 2015 and 41 in 2020. Contributing factors include efforts to promote healthy and responsible reproductive and sexual behaviour among adolescents  a reduction in the incidence of child marriage and increased access to modern contraception. Yet stark disparities persist across regions: in sub-Saharan Africa  the adolescent birth rate remains at 101 births annually per 1 000 women.
As COVID-19 continues to spread  many health facilities are closed or are providing only limited services. Whats more  many women and girls are choosing to skip important medical check-ups for fear of contracting the virus. In addition  global supply chain disruptions may lead to shortages of contraceptives. As a result  tens of millions of women may not be able to access contraceptive services  resulting in millions of unintended pregnancies.
