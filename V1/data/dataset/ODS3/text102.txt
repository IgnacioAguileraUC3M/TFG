      Achieving the ambitious Goal 3to promote health and well-being for all people at all agesplaces high demands on the global health workforce and requires substantive and strategic investments. Available data from 2005-2015 reveal that over 40 per cent of all countries have less than one physician per 1 000 people  and around half have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1 000 people.
  

      An estimated 18 million additional health workers will be needed by 2030 to attain high and effective coverage of the broad range of health services necessary to ensure healthy lives for all. Major shortages of these trained professionals represent a serious concern in almost all countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in more than 90 per cent of the LDCs  where fewer than one physician and three nurses or midwives serve 1 000 people on average. Without targeted interventions  the situation in some of those countries could be further exacerbated by increased labour migration of trained health personnel towards high-income countries with greater demand  thereby undermining already vulnerable health systems.

Note: A country with less than 1 physician and fewer than 3 nurses or midwives per 1 000 people is considered to have an insufficient number of health care professionals. All countries with data in the Europe and Northern America and Australia and New Zealand regions have at least 1 physician and at least 3 nurses or midwives per 1 000 people.
