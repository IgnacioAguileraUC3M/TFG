The incidence of HIV infections globally declined by 39 per cent between 2010 and 2020  far less than the 75 per cent target agreed to by the General Assembly in 2016. Measures to slow the spread of COVID-19  along with the added pressures on health systems  have disrupted HIV services.
In 2020  an estimated 10 million people worldwide fell ill with TB. That year  the notification rate of new and relapse cases in TB incidence fell to 59 per cent  down from 72 per cent in 2019. Disruptions associated with the pandemic globally caused a noticeable rise in the number of TB deaths  from 1.2 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2020 (excluding TB deaths in people with HIV). This is the first year-on-year increase in TB deaths since 2005  and it took the world back to the 2017 level. Progress in reducing TB incidence also slowed in 2020 to less than 2 per cent per year. This is much lower than the 4 to 5 per cent annual decline required to achieve the End TB Strategy (i.e.  an 80 per cent drop in new cases by 2030). Between 2018 and 2020  TB treatment reached 20 million people  only half of the global target. Due to the pandemic  TB incidence and mortality are expected to worsen  especially in 2021 and 2022.

An estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627 000 deaths from malaria were reported worldwide in 2020. This means that 14 million more people contracted malaria and 69 000 more people died from it than in 2019. About two thirds of the additional deaths were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria services during the pandemic. Even before COVID-19  global gains against the disease were levelling off  and the world was not on track to reach the targets set in WHOs Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 20162030. By 2020  the global malaria incidence rate was 59 cases per 1 000 people at risk against a target of 35. In other words  progress against malaria was off track by 40 per cent. 
Two scenarios of global progress in the malaria incidence rate: current trajectory maintained and Global Technical Strategy targets achieved  2010-2030 (new cases per 1 000 people at risk)
Progress towards preventing  controlling and eradicating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) continued in 2020  despite significant disruptions to health services. The number of people globally requiring NTD treatment and care declined from 2.19 billion in 2010 to 1.73 billion in 2020. Notably  in LDCs  48 per cent of the total population required treatment and care for NTDs in 2020  down from 79 per cent in 2010. This progress was largely due to the elimination of a number of NTDs. By the end of 2020  at least one NTD had been eliminated in 42 countries. Important declines were observed in the number of reported cases of diseases targeted for elimination and eradication  including African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in humans and dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease).
