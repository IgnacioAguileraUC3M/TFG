It means that all people have access to the health services they need  when and where they need them  without incurring financial hardship. It includes the full range of essential services  from health promotion to prevention  treatment  rehabilitation and palliative care.
    

      Improvements in coverage have been recorded in all regions and in all income groups: the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index increased from an average of 45 (out of 100) in 2000 to 66 in 2017. The most progress was made in sub-Saharan Africa  with the index almost doubling from 2000 to 2017  from 23 to 44. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic compounds the challenges faced by countries with weaker health systems.
  
To mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic  most countries have established policies  plans and mechanisms to support the maintenance of essential health services. A WHO survey shows that approximately 9 out of 10 responding countries have defined a core set of essential health services to be maintained. Nearly two thirds of countries have allocated additional funds to ensure the continuity of essential health services  and around 60 per cent have adopted approaches to provide vulnerable groups with access to care.
