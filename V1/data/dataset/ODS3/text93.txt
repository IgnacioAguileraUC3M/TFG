    Significant progress has been made in reducing child mortality. In 2015  the mortality rate for children under age 5 worldwide was 43 deaths per 1 000 live birthsa 44 per cent reduction since 2000. This translates to 5.9 million under-5 deaths in 2015  down from 9.8 million in 2000. But despite progress in every region  wide disparities persist. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the highest under-5 mortality rate  with 84 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2015about twice the global average.
    

    Children are most vulnerable in the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period). To reduce child deaths even further  greater attention must be focused on this crucial period  where progress has not been as rapid. In 2015  the global neonatal mortality rate was 19 deaths per 1 000 live births  a 37 per cent reduction since 2000. This means that  in 2015  about 2.7 million children died in the first month of life. Neonatal mortality remains highest in Central and Southern Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa: 29 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2015 in both regions.
    

    The share of newborn deaths in all under-5 deaths grew from 40 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2015  due to the slower pace of progress among newborns. It is estimated that 40 per cent of neonatal deaths could be prevented by providing high-quality care for both mother and baby around the time of birth.
