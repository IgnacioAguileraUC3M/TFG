
Progress has been made in maternal health. The maternal mortality ratio fell by 38 per cent between 2000 and 2017  from 342 deaths to 211 deaths per 100 000 live births worldwide. On average  the global maternal mortality ratio declined by 2.9 per cent each year over this period. Still  this is less than half of the 6.4 per cent annual rate needed to achieve the global target of 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030. Every day in 2017  approximately 810 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for about 86 per cent of maternal deaths globally.
The world has also made tremendous strides in reducing child mortality over the past two decades. The global under-5 mortality rate fell from 76 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2000 to 42 in 2015  and to 39 in 2018. The global neonatal mortality rate fell from 31 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2000 to 18 deaths per 1 000 in 2018. Despite this progress  some 5.3 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday in 2018 alone; almost half of those deaths  or 2.5 million  occurred within the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period). Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rate: in 2018  1 in 13 children died before reaching age 5. That is 16 times higher than the average in high-income countries. By 2018  121 countries had already met the SDG target on under-5 mortality  and 21 countries are expected to do so by 2030. However  progress will need to accelerate in 53 countries  two thirds of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.
As the COVID-19 epidemic continues to erode health systems  disrupt routine health services and constrain access to nutritious diets and essential nutrition services  hundreds of thousands of additional under-5 deaths are expected in 2020  along with tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths. According to a recent study  if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased  the increase in child and maternal deaths could be devastating: 118 low- and middle-income countries could see an increase of 9.8 to 44.8 per cent in under-5 deaths per month and an 8.3 to 38.6 per cent rise in maternal deaths per month  over a period of six months.
