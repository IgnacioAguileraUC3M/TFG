More than 700 000 suicides were reported globally in 2019  with men nearly twice as likely as women to kill themselves. Suicide is among the leading causes of mortality among people aged 15 to 29  constituting around 8 per cent of all deaths in this age group.

A World Health Organization (WHO) survey showed that 90 per cent of countries in early 2021 reported that mental health and psychosocial support were included in their COVID-19 response plans.
Increases in alcohol consumption during the pandemic could have an adverse impact on both physical and mental health. In 2019  an average of 5.8 litres of pure alcohol per person was consumed by people aged 15 and older. Europe has the highest per capita alcohol consumption in the world  at 11.0 litres per year.

During COVID-19 lockdowns  road traffic volume declined tremendously. Nevertheless  road injuries are the leading killer of men aged 15 to 29  contributing to 18 per cent of all deaths in this age group.
