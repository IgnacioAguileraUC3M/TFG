
Remarkable progress has been made in child survival worldwide  and millions of children under 5 years of age are more likely to survive today than in 2000. The under-5 mortality rate has fallen by 49 per centfrom 77 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2000 to 39 deaths in 2017. The total number of under-5 deaths dropped from 9.8 million in 2000 to 5.4 million in 2017. Half of those deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa  and another 30 per cent in Southern Asia. Almost half (2.5 million) of the total number of under-5 deaths took place in the first month of lifethe most crucial period for child survival. The global neonatal mortality rate fell from 31 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2000 to 18 deaths in 2017a 41-per cent reduction. 
Under-5 and neonatal mortality declined in all regions  with the fastest progress in regions where levels were highest. Yet stark disparities persist across regions and countries. In 2017  118 countries already had an under-5 mortality rate below the target of 25 deaths per 1 000 live births. However  progress will need to accelerate in about 50 countries  mostly in sub-Saharan Africa  to meet the target by 2030. If this is achieved  the lives of an additional 10 million children under 5 years of age will be saved. Many of these deaths could be prevented through interventions such as vaccinations  exclusive breastfeeding  proper nutrition  appropriate treatment of common childhood infections  as well as reductions in air pollution and access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation.
