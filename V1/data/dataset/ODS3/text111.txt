
Strong domestic and international commitment and funding for the AIDS response has fuelled an acceleration of evidenced-based programmes for prevention  testing and treatment. As a result  the incidence of HIV among adults (15 to 49 years of age) in sub-Saharan Africa declined by around 37 per cent from 2010 to 2017. This represents a drop from 3.39 infections per 1 000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.14 in 2017. Progress has been slower elsewhere  and some subregions have even seen an increase in HIV incidence  including Western Asia (53 per cent)  Central Asia (51 per cent) and Europe (22 per cent). 
Global HIV incidence among adults declined by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017  well short of the progress required to meet the 2020 and 2030 targets. The largest decline in incidence by age group was among children 0 to 14 years old (37 per cent from 2010 to 2017)  reflecting increased provision of antiretroviral medications to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission.
