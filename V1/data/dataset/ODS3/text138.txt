From 2000 to 2015  the incidence rate of malaria fell from 80 to 57 cases per 1 000 people at risk  and then plateaued from 2015 to 2019. In 2019  an estimated 229 million cases and 409 000 deaths due to malaria were reported worldwide. The Africa region carried a disproportionate share of the global malaria burden  with 94 per cent of malaria cases and deaths in 2019. Gaps in funding and access to life-saving tools are undermining global efforts to curb the disease  and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to set the fight back even further. In the first three months of 2021  between 30 and 40 per cent of malaria-endemic countries reported some level of disruption to services involving malaria diagnosis and treatment. A 10 per cent disruption in access to effective treatment in sub-Saharan Africa could lead to 19 000 additional deaths.
