      Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of poor health and death worldwide. An estimated 10 million people fell ill with the disease in 2017. It was the top killer from a single infectious agent that year (above HIV) and the tenth leading cause of death overall. Nevertheless  significant progress has been made. The incidence of tuberculosis declined by 21 per cent since 2000from 170 new and relapsed cases per 100 000 people that year to 140 in 2015 and 134 in 2017. The tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people fell by 42 per cent over the same period. However  large gaps in detection and treatment persist  and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending the epidemic by 2030. Moreover  drug-resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat. In 2017  there were 558 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin  the most effective first-line drug  of which 460 000 had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
    

      Neglected tropical diseases are slowly being vanquished  but remain a scourge in poorer countries
    

       Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of communicable diseases found in 149 tropical and subtropical countries. They affect billions of peopleparticularly those who live in poverty  lack adequate sanitation  and are in close contact with infectious vectors and domestic animalscosting developing economies billions of dollars each year. In 2017  1.58 billion people required mass or individual treatment and care for NTDs  down from 1.63 billion in 2015 and 2.03 billion in 2010. At least one NTD was eliminated in 34 countries in 2017. However  actual progress is likely even stronger  since improved surveillance is identifying more people requiring interventions against NTDs than in the past. In least developed countries  52 per cent of the population (522 million) required treatment and care for NTDs in 2017  down from 78 per cent in 2010. To effectively control and eliminate NTDs  current measures must be intensified and expanded.
