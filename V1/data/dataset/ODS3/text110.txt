
Immunization is widely recognized as one of the worlds most successful and cost-effective health interventions  saving millions of lives. In 2017  116.2 million children were immunized  the highest number ever reported. At the same time  pockets of low coverage have led to outbreaks of measles and diphtheria  resulting in many deathsa clear demonstration of the importance of reaching full coverage. 
 The proportion of children who have received the required three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3)-containing vaccine increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015  but remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 19.9 million children did not receive the vaccine during the first year of life  putting them at serious risk of potentially fatal diseases.
 Two doses of the measles-containing vaccine are required to prevent the disease and the illness  disability and death caused by associated complications. Coverage by the second dose (MCV2)  given during the second year of a childs life or upon school-entry age  increased from 15 per cent in 2000 to 59 per cent in 2015 and 67 per cent in 2017. This progress  while dramatic  is still insufficient to prevent measles outbreaks. 
 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has the potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under 5 years of age. Globally  coverage by PCV has made steady advances since it was introduced  but has yet to reach 50 per cent. Many countries  including middle-income countries that have limited access to international financial support  are lagging behind because their current health budgets may not be sufficient to cover the costs without external support.
