In spite of gains on many fronts  COVID-19-related service disruptions could cause hundreds of thousands of additional deaths from AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases.
HIV: Globally  HIV incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined by 18 per cent from 2010 to 2018. But advances have been negligible since 2015  putting the world off track in achieving the SDG target. In 2018  HIV incidence was 0.24 per 1 000 uninfected population  and new HIV infections were estimated at 1.7 million. Globally  persistent efforts to reach pregnant women living with HIV have resulted in a 44 per cent decline in incidence among young children between 2010 and 2018. The steepest decline (37 per cent) among adults over that period was seen in sub-Saharan Africa. Still  61 per cent of all new HIV infections occurred in that region in 2018. Efforts must be made to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services and supplies in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Models show that if no action is taken  a six-month complete disruption in HIV services  including antiretroviral therapy  could lead to more than 500 000 additional deaths in 20202021 in sub-Saharan Africa from AIDS-related illnesses  including tuberculosis. 
Malaria: After many years of impressive reductions in the global burden of malaria  progress has stalled. The malaria incidence rate fell by 30 per cent between 2000 and 2014  from 81 to 57 cases per 1 000 population  and then remained at a similarly low level through 2018. The world is not on a trajectory to achieve the SDG target of ending malaria. Worse yet  malaria prevention services could potentially be disrupted by the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic countries. Recent modelling shows that cancellation of prevention campaigns and severe disruptions in treatment in sub-Saharan Africa could lead to a 23 per cent increase in cases and a 100 per cent increase in deaths by the end of 2020 (compared with a 2018 baseline). This means that the projected 769 000 malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone could exceed the number of global malaria deaths in 2000  when the malaria epidemic was at its peak.
Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is the worlds top killer from a single infectious agent and the tenth leading cause of death overall. In 2018  an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (89 per cent were adults  63 per cent were male  and 8.6 per cent were people living with HIV). The incidence of tuberculosis declined from 172 new and relapse cases per 100 000 population in 2000 to 141 per 100 000 in 2015 and 132 in 2018. The tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2018 and 8 per cent between 2015 and 2018. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat: in 2018  there were 484 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin  the most effective first-line drug. Large gaps in detection and treatment persist  and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the SDG target of ending the epidemic by 2030. Modelling suggests that if the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a 25 per cent global reduction in expected tuberculosis detection for 3 months  a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption being observed in multiple countries  then a 13 per cent rise in tuberculosis deaths could be expected. This would bring the world back to the tuberculosis mortality levels of five years ago. 
Neglected tropical diseases: Progress in neglected tropical disease control  elimination and eradication was notable over the past decade. The total number of people who required treatment for neglected tropical diseases declined from 2.19 billion in 2010 to 1.80 billion in 2015 and 1.76 billion in 2018. Progress has been partly driven by the fact that at least one neglected tropical disease was eliminated in each of 40 countries. Nonetheless  52 per cent of the population of LDCs (530 million people) still require treatment and care; this represents a decline from 78 per cent in 2010. Temporary suspension of community-based activities and other disruptions due to COVID-19 may erode gains won by years of hard work and investment in neglected tropical diseases.
