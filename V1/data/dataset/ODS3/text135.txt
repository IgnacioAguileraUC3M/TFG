Substantial progress has been made towards ending preventable child deaths. The global under-5 mortality rate was halved from 2000 to 2019  falling from 76 to 38 deaths per 1 000 live births. Over the same period  the global neonatal mortality rate (death in the first 28 days of life) fell from 30 to 17 deaths per 1 000 live births. Still  5.2 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2019  with almost half of these deaths (2.4 million) occurring in the first month of life.
Globally  83 per cent of births were assisted by skilled health professionals  including medical doctors  nurses and midwives  according to data from 2014 to 2020. This represents a 17 per cent increase from 2007 to 2013. The global adolescent birth rate also showed progress  falling from 56.4 to 41.2 births per 1 000 adolescents aged 15 to 19 from 2000 to 2020. Declines varied considerably across regions  with the largest drops occurring in Central and Southern Asia  from 70.2 to 23.7 births per 1 000 adolescents over the same time period. Unfortunately  the proportion of women of reproductive age (1549 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has stagnated at around 77 per cent since 2015.
In 2020  35 per cent of countries reported interruptions in reproductive  maternal  newborn  child and adolescent health services  along with nutrition services. This magnitude of disruptions could stall or even reverse the progress highlighted above. Disruptions in health services due to the pandemic may have contributed to 228 000 additional child deaths and around 11 000 additional maternal deaths during 2020 in South Asia alone.
