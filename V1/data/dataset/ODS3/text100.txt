In 2012  household air pollution due to cooking with inefficient fuels and technologies led to an estimated 4.3 million deaths worldwide. Most parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest mortality rate owing to household pollution  at between 68 and 87 deaths per 100 000 people  compared to 60 globally. Exposure to household pollution is particularly high among women and young children  who tend to spend more time indoors and near the stove.
