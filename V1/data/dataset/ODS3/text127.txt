Based on global 20132018 data  women comprise over 76 per cent of medical doctors and nursing personnel combined  but the distribution varies considerably between the two occupations. Women represent just over 40 per cent of medical doctors but almost 90 per cent of nursing personnel. Recent studies show that  although women comprise the majority of the health and social sector workforce  they are often underrepresented at the senior management level.
    

      The pandemic is highlighting the existing shortage of health professionals in many countries  particularly in regions with the highest burden of disease. Over 40 per cent of all countries have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people; over 55 per cent of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people. An additional 18 million health workers are needed  primarily in low- and lower-middle income countries  to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.
