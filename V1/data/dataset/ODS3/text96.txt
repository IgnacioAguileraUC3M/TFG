      In 2015  an estimated 2.1 million people worldwide were newly infected with HIV. This translates to 0.3 new infections per 1 000 uninfected people  a reduction of 46 per cent since 2000. The rate of HIV new infections among children under age 15 declined by 72 per cent between 2000 and 2015 due to the rapid expansion in access to antiretroviral drugs for preventing mother-to-child transmission. In sub-Saharan Africa  the rate of new HIV infections has dropped by 62 per cent since 2000. However  this region continues to have the highest HIV incidence  at 1.5 new infections per 1 000 uninfected people in 2015.
  

    Targeted disease elimination and control programmes have also helped reduce the incidence of other communicable diseases. In 2015  there were 142 new tuberculosis cases per 100 000 people  a decline of 17 per cent since 2000. The global malaria incidence rate in 2015 was 94 per 1 000 people at risk  representing a 41 per cent decrease since 2000. In 2015  1.6 billion people required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases  a 21 per cent decline from 2010.
