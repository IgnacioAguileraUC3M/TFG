
 The International Health Regulations is a legally binding agreement that requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to the World Health Organization (WHO). Since 2010  all 196 States Parties have sent reports to WHO on their capacity to implement the Regulations  and on their preparedness to deal with health emergencies more generally. In 2018  190 States Parties submitted reports  compared to 167 in 2017.
 An analysis of 182 reports shows that  globally  progress has been made in all 13 of the Regulations core capacities. Almost all States Parties are performing better in detection (e.g.  surveillance and laboratory detection) than in emergency preparedness and response. Bigger gaps have been observed in capacity at points of entry (e.g.  ports  airports and ground crossings) and in chemical safety and radiation emergencies. Although more work remains  these reports are clear evidence of international commitment and effort to improve early warning systems  and reduce and manage public health risks.
