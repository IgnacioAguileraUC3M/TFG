    Around 1.25 million people died from road traffic accidents in 2013  an average of 3 400 each day. In addition  tens of millions of people are injured or disabled each year from traffic accidents  with children  pedestrians  cyclists and older people among the most vulnerable. Halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles  which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013.
