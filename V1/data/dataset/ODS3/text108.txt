
Despite significant progress in maternal health  in 2017  nearly 300 000 women died from complications relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Over 90 per cent of them lived in low- and middle-income countries. For every woman who died  countless others suffered acute and even lifelong consequences of maternal ill health.
 The majority of maternal deaths are preventable through appropriate management and care  including antenatal care by trained health providers  assistance during delivery by skilled health personnel  and care and support in the weeks after childbirth. However  progress has slowed in recent years. Continued investment and attention are needed to reach the global target of fewer than 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030  which could save more than one million lives over the course of a decade.
 Ensuring that all births are assisted by skilled health professionals is not only critical to reducing maternal morbidity and mortality  but also to reducing stillbirths  morbidity and death among newborns. Based on the latest data from 2013 to 2018  81 per cent of all births globally took place in the presence of skilled health personnel  a significant increase from 69 per cent from 2006 to 2012. In sub-Saharan Africa  where two thirds of the worlds maternal deaths occur  only 60 per cent of births were assisted by skilled attendants. Projections show that substantially more resources will be required just to maintain current coverage rates in Africa  due to population growth. 
Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries. The risk is highest for girls under 15 years of age. Globally  the adolescent fertility rate declined from 56 births per 1 000 adolescent girls in 2000 to 45 in 2015 and 44 in 2018. However  the adolescent fertility rate remained high in sub-Saharan Africa at 101 births per 1 000 adolescent girls in 2018.
