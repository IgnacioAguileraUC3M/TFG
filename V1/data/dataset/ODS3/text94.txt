      In 2015  an estimated 303 000 women worldwide died due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This translates into a global maternal mortality ratio of 216 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2015  a 37 per cent reduction since 2000. Achieving the global target of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030 requires a global annual rate of reduction of at least 7.5 per cent  more than double the rate achieved between 2000 and 2015.
    

      Most maternal deaths can be prevented by providing antenatal care during pregnancy and skilled care during childbirth  as well as care and support in the weeks after childbirth. In sub-Saharan Africa  only half of live births benefitted from skilled care during delivery in 2016.
