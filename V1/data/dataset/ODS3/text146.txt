Many health indicators were moving in the right direction before the threat of COVID-19 emerged. Maternal and child health had improved  immunization coverage had increased and communicable diseases had been reduced  although not fast enough to meet those 2030 targets. The pandemic has halted or reversed progress in health and poses major threats beyond the disease itself. About 90 per cent of countries are still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services  and available data from a few countries show that the pandemic has shortened life expectancy. Not surprisingly  the virus is disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.
The pandemic has demonstrated the importance of universal health coverage and multisectoral coordination for health emergency preparedness.  Moreover  to design effective pandemic policy interventions  Governments will need to improve and strengthen basic demographic and epidemiological data collection.
