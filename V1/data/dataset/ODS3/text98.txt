      In 2015  an estimated 30 million people worldwide died prematurely (before age 70). More than half of these deaths (56 per cent) were attributed to non-communicable diseases; of these  over three quarters (13 million) were caused by cardiovascular disease  cancer  diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. From 2000 to 2015  the risk of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 from one of these four diseases fell from 23 per cent to 19 per cent. While this represents significant progress  it fell short of the rate needed to meet the 2030 target of a one-third reduction in premature deaths from these four main non-communicable diseases.
  

    People in Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand are at greatest risk: they had a 34 per cent probability of dying prematurely from one of these four diseases in 2015. Many of these deaths could be prevented through reductions in tobacco use and harmful alcohol consumption  the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity  and universal health coverage.
