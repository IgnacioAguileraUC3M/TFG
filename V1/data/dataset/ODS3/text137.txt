Globally  HIV incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined by 24 per cent over the last decade. It fell from 0.48 infections per 1 000 uninfected people in 2010 to 0.37 in 2019  when 1.7 million new HIV infections were reported  still three times the global target of fewer than 500 000 by 2020. The main reasons targets were missed were inequalities in access to HIV prevention  testing and treatment services across regions  countries and subpopulations within countries. The pandemic has caused considerable disruptions to HIV services.
In 2019  an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB)  the leading killer from a single infectious agent. Between 2015 and 2019  the global TB incidence rate declined from 142 to 130 new and relapse cases per 100 000 people. This 8.5 per cent decline fell short of the target of a 20 per cent reduction between 2015 and 2020. An estimated 1.4 million fewer people received the necessary care for TB in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic  a reduction in treatment of 21 per cent. In India  Indonesia  the Philippines and South Africa  four countries that account for 44 per cent of global TB cases  there was a 25 to 30 per cent drop in the reported number of people diagnosed with TB between January and June 2020  compared with the same period in 2019.
