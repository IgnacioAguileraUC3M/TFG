      Untreated chronic viral hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications. Since 2000  the total number of deaths from hepatitis has increased by 22 per cent  contributing to an estimated 1.34 million deaths in 2015. About 900 000 of these deaths were attributed to hepatitis B virus infections. Greater access to hepatitis testing and treatment is essential to reversing the trend of increasing mortality. In 2015  only 9 per cent of an estimated 257 million persons infected with the hepatitis B virus were diagnosed  and 8 per cent of those diagnosed were on treatment.
  

    An early win in the global response to viral hepatitis was achieved through expanded vaccination coverage. In 2015  84 per cent of one-year-olds received vaccinations for hepatitis B  compared to 29 per cent in 2000. As a result  the global prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection among children under age 5 was 1.3 per cent in 2015  much lower than the 4.7 per cent found during the pre-vaccination period  which ranges from 1980s to early 2000s.
