Manufacturing output has increased in most regions of the world  and manufacturing value added (MVA) per capita increased globally by 22.6 per cent in real terms between 2005 and 2016. But while MVA per capita has increased globally  broader industrialization has been hampered by intense concentrations of production in some countries and regions. This has resulted in marked inequalities  with industrial productivity varying widely between richer and poorer regions. In 2016  MVA per capita was 100 US dollars a year in LDCs (although it had increased 59 per cent in real terms since 2005)  compared to 4 621 US dollars in Europe and Northern America. As manufacturing production shifts from higher-income regions in search of lower costs  countries that currently have low levels of MVA per capita stand to benefit.
