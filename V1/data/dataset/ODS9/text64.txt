Investing in infrastructure  promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization  and supporting technological development  research and innovation are three driving forces for economic growth and sustainable development. These drivers can help countries reduce poverty by creating job opportunities  stimulating growth  and encouraging the building and improvement of physical facilities that are essential to the functioning of business and society. In recent years  steady improvements have been made in all three of these areas of sustainable development. However  renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries (LDCs) to build infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industrys share of GDP in those countries by 2030.
