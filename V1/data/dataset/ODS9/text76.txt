
 Small-scale industries are the backbone of industrial development in developing countries. With a relatively small amount of capital investment and a predominantly local resource base  small-scale industries generate a substantial amount of employment and self-employment. However  one of the biggest challenges those industries face is access to loans or lines of credit for everyday business activities. Adequate financing is crucial for those industries to grow  since it allows them to innovate  improve efficiency  expand to new markets and create new job opportunities. While 31.5 per cent of small-scale industries (manufacturing and services) worldwide benefit from loans or lines of credit  regional differences stand out. For instance  more than half of all small-scale industries in Latin America and the Caribbean receive those types of financial services  compared to 20.7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
