The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of industrialization  techological innovation and resilient infrastructure in building back better and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Economies with a diversified industrial sector and strong infrastructure (e.g.  transport  Internet connectivity and utility services) sustained less damage and are experiencing faster recovery. In 2021  global manufacturing rebounded from the pandemic  although the recovery remains incomplete and uneven. In LDCs  recovery has been sluggish and remains uncertain; almost one in three manufacturing jobs was negatively impacted by the  crisis. Women  youth and low- and middle-skilled workers suffered the most losses. Overall  higher-technology industries performed better and recovered faster  providing a strong example of how important technological innovation is to achieving Goal 9.
