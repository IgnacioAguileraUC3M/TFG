The proportion of the worlds energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation has almost doubled over the last decade  from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014. More extensive deployment of clean technologies will increase the likelihood of achieving the proposed target of upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries to make them sustainable  with increasingly efficient use of resources and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes.
