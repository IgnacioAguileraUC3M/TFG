
 The growth of manufacturing in both developing and developed regions slowed in 2018  attributed largely to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrain investment and future expansion. Despite the slowdown  the global share of manufacturing value added (MVA) in GDP increased marginallyfrom 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 16.5 per cent in 2018  when it began to plateau. In LDCs  the share of manufacturing in total GDP increased 2.5 per cent annually between 2015 and 2018. However  that still falls short of the pace needed to achieve a doubling of the MVA share in GDP by 2030  and calls for accelerated action. The disparities in industrial productivity between rich and poor nations remain stark. For instance  MVA per capita was only $114 in LDCs compared to $4 938 in Europe and Northern America  in 2018.
