
The year 2020 was catastrophic for air travel demand. Air passengers dropped from 4.5 billion globally in 2019 to 1.8 billion in 2020  a 60 per cent decline. As a result  jobs supported by the air transport industry fell by 52.5 per cent over the course of 2020  from 87.7 million to 41.7 million. Airline financial losses are projected at $371 billion in 2020  with an extra $115 billion and $13 billion in losses for airports and air navigation services providers  respectively.
A constantly changing list of open- and closed-destination countries has added a level of uncertainty. Air transport is not projected to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. Governments should coordinate and do what they can to bolster the air transport industry to restore lost jobs and get the global economy back on track.
