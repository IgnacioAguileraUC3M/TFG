The number of airline passengers travelling internationally totalled 1.8 billion in 2020  a decline of 60 per cent from the previous year. Seat capacity dropped by half  bringing air traffic totals down to levels not seen since 2003. Financial losses for the airline industry totalled $370 billion in 2020  and airports and air navigation services providers lost a further $115 billion and $13 billion  respectively. Global air passenger traffic recovered modestly in 2021 with 2.3 billion passengers  compared with 4.5 billion in 2019  resulting in financial losses of $324 billion. In 2021  domestic air traffic reached 68 per cent of 2019 levels  while international traffic remained weak  at 28 per cent  mostly due to sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 variants and travel restrictions.
In contrast with passenger traffic  air cargo traffic exceeded pre-pandemic levels by the beginning of 2021 and is maintaining robust growth. This upturn has been driven by a resurgence of economic activity along with a roaring e-commerce industry during the pandemic.

      The lack of credit or other support has dealt a death blow to many small-scale industries
    
Small-scale enterprises were hit hard by the pandemic  and many collapsed. Due to their scale  limited financial resources and greater dependency on supply chains  these industries are more vulnerable to economic downturns than their larger-scale counterparts. The impact has been even more severe for small informal enterprises  partly because they have been unable to access formal lines of credit or COVID-19-related government support.
Government support plays a key role in helping small enterprises survive and thrive during and after a crisis. However  only about one in three small manufacturers are benefiting from a loan or line of credit  according to limited survey data collected in 20202021. Such stimulus is rarely available in low-income countries. Only 15.7 per cent of small-scale industries in Africa received those forms of credit  compared with 44.2 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean.
