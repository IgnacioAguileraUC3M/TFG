Higher-technology manufacturing industries fared better than lower-tech industries during the pandemic  and therefore recovered faster. Most industries using medium and high technology   such as computers  electronics and pharmaceuticals  have already returned to pre-pandemic production levels  except for motor vehicle and other transport equipment manufacturing. Production of motor vehicles is facing larger challenges worldwide due to supply chain disruptions of resources and intermediate goods. In comparison  lower-tech industries  such as textiles and clothing  or coke and refined petroleum products  remain below their pre-pandemic levels. The manufacture of basic consumer goods  such as food products  has seen a stable growth trajectory since the pandemic  with limited losses.
According to 2019 data  the share of medium- and high-tech manufacturing in total manufacturing in Europe and Northern America was 47.7 per cent compared with 21.4 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 10.5 per cent in LDCs.
