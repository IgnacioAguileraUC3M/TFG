
 Air transport is a driver of economic development. In 2016  the direct and indirect global economic impact of air transport was estimated at $2.7 trillion  which is equivalent to 3.6 per cent of the worlds GDP. The COVID-19 outbreak has hit the aviation industry hard. By April 2020  strict travel restrictions by governments and concerns among travelers had led to the grounding of about 90 per cent of fleets  with travel demand dropping to near zero. In the first five months of 2020  passenger numbers plunged by 51.1 per cent compared with the same period in 2019. According to 5 June 2020 estimates from the International Civil Aviation Organization  the pandemic may cause an overall reduction of 2.29 billion to 3.06 billion passengers in 2020  resulting in losses of between $302 billion and $400 billion in gross operating revenues for airlines compared with business-as-usual operations. A safe and sustainable recovery of the aviation industry  which will also accelerate recovery in other sectors including tourism and trade  will require a coordinated global effort.
