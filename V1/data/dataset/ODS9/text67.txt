Emissions levels have also been reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. Between 2000 and 2014  almost all regions showed a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from manufacturing per unit of MVA. Europe and Northern America reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent over this period  and all of the 10 largest manufacturing countries saw decreases. These promising trends are not reflected in the global emissions intensity level  however  since a significant share of global MVA has moved to countries with poorer emissions performance.
