People in previously unconnected areas have joined the global information society and  in 2015  95 per cent of people living in the LDCs were covered by a mobile-cellular signal. However  higher-speed Internet access through third-generation (3G) mobile-broadband networks is less widespread: Only 29 per cent of the rural population are covered. Increasingly  Internet access is a requirement for producers and entrepreneurs to remain competitive and greater efforts are needed to expand this type of coverage to rural and remote parts of the world.
