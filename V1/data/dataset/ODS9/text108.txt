
In most developing countries  mobile broadband (third generation (3G) or higher) is the main  and often  the only way to connect to the Internet. But in addition to connectivity  potential users need an Internet-enabled device and the skills to use it. The relatively high cost of such devices  along with the lack of literacy and digital skills  remain steep barriers to mobile Internet adoption and use.
Between 2015 and 2021  4G network coverage doubled  reaching 88 per cent of the worlds population. Although 2021 estimates show that 95 per cent of the worlds population are covered by a mobile-broadband network  the gap remains significant for LDCs and landlocked developing countries  where 17 per cent of the population are without coverage. This means that  SDG target 9.c  to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020  has not been met.
While virtually all urban areas of the world are covered by a mobile-broadband network  gaps persist in rural areas. In LDCs  14 per cent of the rural population have no mobile network coverage at all  while another 12 per cent have only 2G coverage.

are not covered by a more advanced technology.
