They are central to income-generation and the alleviation of poverty and will play a crucial role in the recovery of the global economy post-COVID-19. However  they are vulnerable due to their small size and limited resources. They do not have the capacity to deal with unexpected shocks  such as the current crisis  without help from governments.
Access to credit is particularly important to small-scale firms for increasing their competitiveness and enabling them to integrate into local and global value chains. In developing countries  34.7 per cent of small-scale industries (manufacturing and services) benefit from loans or lines of credit. However  only 22.9 per cent of small-scale industries in sub-Saharan Africa received loans or lines of credit  compared with almost half in Latin America and the Caribbean  according to recent data. Providing fiscal stimulus and access to financial services in support of small- and medium-sized enterprises is essential to enabling them to survive and thrive during and after the crisis.
