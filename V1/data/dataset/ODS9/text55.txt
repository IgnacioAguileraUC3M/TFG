However  inequalities in the value added in the manufacturing sector point to the steep challenges faced by the most disadvantaged countries  as well as their potential for growth. For example  in 2015  manufacturing value added (MVA) per capita was less than 100 US dollars a year in the least developed countries (LDCs) compared to 4 926 US dollars in developed regions. Significant investment is needed in the LDCs to boost technological progress and economic growth  and to achieve the target of doubling industrys share in the gross domestic product of these countries. Trends in MVA show steady increases in developing regions and a slight decline in developed regions  which is similar to trends in manufacturing jobs. The potential for growth in manufacturing employment is particularly high in the LDCs  because large segments of the population continue to work in agricultural and traditional sectors.
