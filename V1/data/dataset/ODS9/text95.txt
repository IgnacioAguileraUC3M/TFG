
The structural transition within manufacturing is best reflected in the shift towards more technologically complex products. Medium- and high-tech products dominate manufacturing in industrialized economies. In 2018  the share of medium- and high-tech manufacturing was 49.0 per cent in developed regions and 41.4 per cent in developing regions  compared with 8.9 per cent in LDCs.
In the first half of 2020  world manufacturing suffered a severe slump triggered by global lockdowns. However  by the third and fourth quarters of that year  most economies showed signs of recovery  led mainly by medium- and high-tech manufacturing. During the fourth quarter of 2020  these industries registered growth of nearly 4 per cent compared with the same period in 2019. This growth was fuelled by the rise in demand for computer electronics due to a global shift towards working from home  remote-learning and e-commerce. Global manufacturing of low-tech products saw negative growth in the last quarter of 2020 (-1.8 per cent).
