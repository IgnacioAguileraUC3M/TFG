The slowdown affected all regions and country groups. In LDCs  the share of manufacturing in GDP increased from 10.0 per cent in 2010 to 12.4 per cent in 2019. However  the rate of growth was too slow to reach the target of doubling industrys share in GDP by 2030. Moreover  manufacturing value added per capita in LDCs reached only $132 in 2019  lagging far behind Europe and Northern America  where it was $4 856.
Global manufacturing output growth saw a sharp decline of 6.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 due to economic lockdown measures. China  the worlds largest manufacturer  was walloped by COVID-19 in the first quarter of the year  registering an unprecedented drop of 14.1 per cent in manufacturing output. Since manufacturing is considered an engine of overall economic growth  the global slump in manufacturing production has had serious impacts on the global economy.
