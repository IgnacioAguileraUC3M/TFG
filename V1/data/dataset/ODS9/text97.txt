Small-scale industries have been severely affected by the pandemic  and many continue to face existential challenges. According to establishment-level surveys conducted from 2006 to 2020  almost one in three small industrial enterprises benefit from a loan or line of credit. Access to credit remains uneven across countries and regions of the world. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and LDCs suffer the most from a lack of credit: approximately one in six small-scale industries in these countries have a loan or line of credit  compared with almost half in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Although some Governments have responded to the pandemic with economic support measures  transferring cash to businesses  delaying loan payments or refinancing loans to more favourable terms  policymakers in LDCs and emerging economies have far less leverage to provide such measures. In a post-pandemic world  access to finance will play an essential role in economic recovery.
