 Inclusive and sustainable industrialization  together with innovation and infrastructure  can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies  facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources. However  the world still has a long way to go to fully tap this potential. LDCs  in particular  need to accelerate the development of their manufacturing sector if they are to meet the 2030 target  and scale up investment in scientific research and innovation. On a positive note  the carbon intensity of manufacturing industries declined at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent from 2010 and 2016  showing a general decoupling of CO2 emissions and GDP growth. Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017  an increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. Further  impressive gains have been made in mobile connectivity.
