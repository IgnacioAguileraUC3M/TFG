
The importance of investing in research and development (R&D) has never been more apparent. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrates the critical role of  innovation in unexpected crises. Global investment in R&D reached $2.2 trillion (purchasing power parity) in 2018  up from $1.4 trillion in 2010. As a result  the proportion of global GDP invested in R&D increased from 1.61 per cent in 2010 to 1.73 per cent in 2018. The number of researchers per million inhabitants worldwide jumped from 1 022 in 2010 to 1 235 in 2018.
The pandemic is not the only crisis the world is facing  and it will not be the last. Policy commitments towards financing for R&D  especially in developing economies  need to continue and be strengthened. Most developing regions fell short of the world average. Spending on R&D as a share of GDP ranged from 0.37 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa to 0.86 per cent in Northern Africa and Western Asia. For LDCs and landlocked developing countries  the average was 0.20 per cent. This is only a small fraction of the proportion spent in more developed regions.
