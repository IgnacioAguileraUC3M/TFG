To access the Internet  mobile connections provide flexibility  particularly in places where fixed-broadband service is unavailable or unaffordable. Coverage of mobile access has expanded rapidly. In 2019  almost the entire world population (97 per cent) lived within reach of a mobile cellular signal  and 93 per cent lived within reach of a mobile-broadband signal. Least developed countries have seen significant growth in coverage of mobile-broadband signals  from 51 per cent in 2015 to 79 per cent in 2019. However  just 54 per cent of the global population actually use the Internet. Most of the offline population live in LDCs  where only 19 per cent use the Internet  compared with 87 per cent in developed countries. Key reasons for this large gap are the cost of using the Internet and the lack of necessary skills.
