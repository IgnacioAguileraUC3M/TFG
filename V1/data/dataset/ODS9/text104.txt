After dropping 1.3 per cent in 2020  global manufacturing production grew by 7.2 per cent in 2021  surpassing its pre-pandemic level. However  recovery remains uneven among countries. High-income countries benefited from massive policy support to firms and households and the rapid roll-out of effective vaccines. In contrast  recovery in LDCs has been sluggish  due to subdued and volatile global demand  global trade disruption and tighter domestic economic policies.
The global share of manufacturing value added (MVA) in total GDP increased from 16.2 per cent in 2015 to 16.9 per cent in 2021. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia expanded its share from 25.5 to 26.1 per cent over the same period  due to strong global demand for manufacturing and exports in the region. However  the share in LDCs was only 12.5 per cent in 2021. The same disparities are reflected in MVA per capita. While Europe and Northern America reached an all-time high of $5 000 in 2021  MVA per capita in LDCs decreased to $135  comparable to 2018.
