This represented an average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. In relative terms  1.7 per cent of global GDP was devoted to R&D. However  this figure masks wide differences among regions: In Europe and Northern America  the average stood at 2.2 per cent of GDP  while in sub-Saharan Africa  the share was only 0.4 per cent. A large proportion of R&D expenditures go towards the wages and salaries of researchers  technicians and support staff  which is why the figures for researchers follow a similar pattern. Globally  there were almost 1 098 researchers per million inhabitants in 2014  ranging from a low of 63 in LDCs to a high of 3 500 in Europe and Northern America.
