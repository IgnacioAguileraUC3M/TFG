As a result of prolonged lockdowns and travel bans  nearly one in three jobs in manufacturing supply chains worldwide have likely been terminated  seen a reduction in working hours or pay  or been the target of other cutbacks. Globally  the share of manufacturing jobs in total employment declined from 13.7 per cent in 2019 to 13.1 per cent in 2020. The impact has been particularly pronounced in middle-income countries  which have long leveraged participation in production chains as a source of employment and growth. The decline in manufacturing employment in middle-income countries sank to 8.9 per cent in 2020  compared with 3.4 per cent in low-income and 3.9 per cent in high-income countries. Some of the worst effects were felt in garment supply chains  which employ large shares of women workers. Despite a rebound in 2021  the fragile and uneven nature of the recovery means that global manufacturing employment has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Fiscal stimulus and vaccination coverage were crucial factors in determining the strength of labour market recovery in 2021.
