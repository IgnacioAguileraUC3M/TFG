Rural road connectivity provides farmers and their families easy access to markets  along with health and education facilities. This helps reduce poverty by elevating agricultural productivity  business profitability and employment. Rural access index data  measuring the proportion of people within two kilometres of an all-season road  from 25 countries mostly developing countries for 2018 to 2019 indicate that almost 300 million out of 520 million rural dwellers lack good access to roads.
In 2020  almost the entire world population lived within range of mobile networks  with 85 per cent covered by a fourth-generation (4G) network. Between 2015 and 2020  global 4G coverage doubled. However  coverage does not necessarily mean usage: only 51 per cent of the population used the Internet in 2019  leaving 3.7 billion people without Internet access. In LDCs  only one in five people were online in 2020  failing to achieve the target of universal and affordable Internet access.
