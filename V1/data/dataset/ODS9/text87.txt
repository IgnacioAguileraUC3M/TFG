
 Globally  R&D has continued to grow at a brisk pace  reaching $2.2 trillion (purchasing power parity) in 2017  up from $1.4 trillion in 2010 and 741 billion in 2000. While Europe and Northern America leads in R&D  representing 47.6 per cent of global investments in 2017  Eastern and South-Eastern Asia is quickly catching up  increasing its share in R&D investment from 22.6 per cent in 2000 to 40.4 per cent in 2017. In relative terms  the proportion of global GDP invested in R&D increased from 1.62 per cent in 2010 to 1.72 per cent in 2017. Yet regional disparities are extreme  ranging from 2.25 per cent in Europe and Northern America to 0.38 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. For LDCs and landlocked developing countries  the proportion was around 0.20 per cent.
The importance of increased investment in R&D  perhaps at a faster rate  has been highlighted by COVID-19. More investment is needed in the pharmaceutical industry and in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence  which can assist in developing drugs and vaccines and in managing related services and resources.
