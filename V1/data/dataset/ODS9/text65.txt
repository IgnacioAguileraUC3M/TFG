In 2015  the global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was estimated at 2.7 trillion US dollars  or 3.5 per cent of global GDP. Road transport continues to be the predominant form of freight transport globally  accounting for 61 per cent of the total. Europe and Northern America  and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia account for most freight transport (all modes)  with Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand and sub-Saharan Africa accounting for only a small fraction of the global total. Passenger transport follows a similar pattern. The LDCs  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States represent far less air travel and freight volumes  with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total.
