
 The proportion of global GDP invested in research and development (R&D) increased from 1.52 per cent in 2000 to 1.68 per cent in 2016. In absolute terms  global R&D investment reached $2 trillion (purchasing power parity) in 2016  up from $739 billion in 2000. That represents an average annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent when adjusted for inflation. Wide disparities are found among regions. In Europe and Northern America  2.21 per cent of GDP was spent on R&D in 2016  compared to 0.42 per cent and 0.83 per cent  respectively  in sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia. Such disparities indicate the continued need for strong policy support for increased financing for R&D in developing regions.
