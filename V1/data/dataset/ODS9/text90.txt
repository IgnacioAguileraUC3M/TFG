 Promoting inclusive and sustainable industries and continuing to invest in physical infrastructure  innovation and research are vital to long-term economic development. Investment in research and development (R&D) globally  and financing for economic infrastructure in developing countries has increased. Whats more  the intensity of global CO2 emissions has declined  and impressive progress has been made in mobile connectivity. However  the growth of manufacturing has decelerated and industrialization in LDCs is still too slow. The pandemic has dealt a severe blow to manufacturing and transport industries  causing disruptions in global value chains and the supply of products as well as job losses and declining work hours in these sectors. In developing countries  manufacturing jobs are an essential source of income and are key to poverty reduction. The effects of COVID-19 have been so destabilizing that they threaten to halt or even reverse progress towards SDG 9 and other Goals.
