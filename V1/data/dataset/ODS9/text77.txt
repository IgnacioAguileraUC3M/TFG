
 Recent years have seen a steady shift away from resource-based  low-tech manufacturing activities towards those that are medium-high- to high-tech. Those higher-tech manufacturing sectors are often reliant on the latest technologies and produce a wide array of consumer goods  from computers  televisions and other communications devices to appliances and other household equipment. The demand for such products tends to increase as income levels rise. 
 The share of medium-high- and high-tech industries in total MVA increased from 40.5 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2016  with large differences across regions. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and in Europe and Northern America  for example  over 47 per cent of total MVA came from higher-tech sectors in 2016. In contrast  the shares in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and sub-Saharan Africa were only 1.9 per cent and 14.9 per cent  respectively. In sub-Saharan Africa  the proportion of medium-high- and high-tech MVA in total MVA actually fell between 2000 and 2016  but rose in all other regions.
