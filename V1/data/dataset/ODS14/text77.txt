Large urban populations and intensive agricultural production or livestock are often associated with coastal eutrophication. Of the 63 large marine ecosystems evaluated under the Transboundary Water Assessment Programme  16 per cent are in the high or highest risk categories for coastal eutrophication  particularly from sewage and agriculture. They are primarily located off the coasts of Western Europe and Southern and Eastern Asia  and in the Gulf of Mexico. Most major marine ecosystems are still considered in the lowest or low risk category. By 2050  however  it is estimated that coastal eutrophication will increase in 21 per cent of these large ecosystems. To tackle these risks  nutrient inputs need to be reduced through sewage treatment and initiatives addressing agricultural practices.
