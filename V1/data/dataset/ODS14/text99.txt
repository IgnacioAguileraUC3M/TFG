 Oceans are our planets life support and regulate the global climate system. They are the worlds largest ecosystem  home to nearly a million known species  containing vast untapped potential for scientific discovery. Oceans and fisheries continue to support the global populations economic  social and environmental needs. Despite the critical importance of conserving oceans  decades of irresponsible exploitation have led to an alarming level of degradation. Current efforts to protect key marine environments and small-scale fisheries  and to invest in ocean science are not but meeting the urgent need to safeguard this vast  yet fragile  resource. The drastic reduction in human activity brought about by the COVID-19 crisis  while rooted in tragedy  is a chance for oceans to recuperate. It is also an opportunity to chart a sustainable recovery path that will ensure livelihoods for decades to come in harmony with the natural environment.
