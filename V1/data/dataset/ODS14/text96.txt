 Small-scale fishers  who account for more than half of total fishery output in developing countries  continue to be among the most marginalized food producers. Moreover  evidence suggests that the COVID-19 crisis is already affecting their livelihoods adversely  as global demand for seafood dwindles and transportation restrictions prevent market access. At the same time  small-scale producers fulfil a critical role in providing food for local communities. It is more important than ever for countries to support small-scale fishers as key contributors to sustainable food systems. This can be achieved by adopting specific initiatives to implement the internationally agreed Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication.
