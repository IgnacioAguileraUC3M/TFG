Oceans cover almost three quarters of the planet  comprising the largest ecosystem on Earth. Large coastal populations in every region depend on them for their livelihoods and prosperity. Oceans also provide priceless environmental services: they generate half the oxygen we breathe  support a wealth of marine resources and act as a climate regulator. Yet despite their critical importance  the mounting impacts of climate change (including ocean acidification)  overfishing and marine pollution are jeopardizing progress in protecting the worlds oceans. Small island developing States are the most threatened. Due to the transboundary nature of oceans  marine resource management requires interventions at all levels (national  regional and global) to mitigate threats.
