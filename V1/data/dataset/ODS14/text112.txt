
The ocean absorbs around one quarter of the world's annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions  thereby mitigating climate change and alleviating its impacts. This critical service  however  comes at a price: it is altering the carbonate system and increasing the acidity of the ocean. Ocean acidification threatens organisms and ecosystem services  endangers fisheries and aquaculture  and affects coastal protection by weakening coral reefs. Further increases in acidification are expected to accelerate over the coming decades. As acidification worsens  the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere will diminish  limiting its role in moderating climate change.
Over the last two years  the number of observation stations reporting on ocean acidification has almost doubled  from 178 in 2021 to 308 in 2022. Gaps in reporting and data remain. Observation sites in the open ocean have indicated a continuous decline in pH over the past 20 to 30 years. Coastal observations  on the other hand  present a more varied picture due to multiple stressors.
