 Protected areas play a critical role in sustainable development if they are both effectively managed and located in areas important for biodiversity. As of December 2018  17 per cent of waters under national jurisdiction were covered by protected areas. This is a significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double the coverage level in 2010. The mean percentage of marine key biodiversity areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas also increased from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 45.7 per cent in 2018.
 Despite that progress  the rate at which KBAs are being protected has slowed and  if current trends continue  will flatten by 2030. Developing countries  in particular LDCs and small island developing States  are lagging behind. A redoubling of efforts is needed to establish new marine protected areas and to strengthen the management of existing ones.
