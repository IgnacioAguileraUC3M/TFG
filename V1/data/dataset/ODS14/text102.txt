The extent of marine protected areas has increased significantly  with 2020 coverage reaching 7.74 per cent of global coastal waters and oceans. The 10 per cent target set for 2020 may still be met  because several sites planned for designation in 2020 were delayed. Between 2000 and 2020  the mean percentage of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas grew from 28 per cent to 44 per cent. However  increases have plateaued  and coverage rose by only 1 percentage point over the last five years. On average  over half of each KBA remains outside of any form of protection.
Safeguarding KBAs remains crucial to the sustainability of oceans. A recent example from the South Atlantic used satellite tracking data for 14 species of seabirds and seals to pinpoint breeding grounds and feeding sites crucial to the preservation of these and other species. This information was used to revise the management of a marine protected area by extending the closure of fisheries by two months and expanding several permanent no-fishing zones  while allowing commercial fishing to occur in a regulated manner.
