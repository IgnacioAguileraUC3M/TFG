 To preserve the health and productivity of fisheries  fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable levels. Overfishing not only reduces food production  but also impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity  with negative repercussions for the economy and society. Worldwide  the proportion of marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 67 per cent in 2015. However  this decreasing trend appears to have stabilized since 2008an encouraging sign. 
 In 2015  the Mediterranean and Black Sea region had the lowest percentage of sustainable fish stocks (37.8 per cent)  followed closely by the Southeast Pacific region (38.5 per cent). In contrast  the Eastern Central Pacific and Northeast Pacific regions had the highest proportion of fish stocks at biologically sustainable levels (above 85 per cent). More focused efforts are needed to rebuild overfished stocks  particularly in severely depleted regions.
