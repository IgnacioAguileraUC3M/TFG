Conserve and sustainably use the oceans  seas and marine resources
The worlds oceans  their temperature  chemistry  currents and life  drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole  and to counter balance the effects of climate change.
Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However  today we are seeing 30 percent of the worlds fish stocks overexploited  well below a level at which they can produce sustainable yields.
Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans  and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution  an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources  is reaching alarming levels  with an average of 13 000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometer of ocean.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create a framework to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from land-based pollution  as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.
Protecting our oceans is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
