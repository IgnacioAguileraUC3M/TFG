 Marine research can be expensive and logistically challenging  requiring advanced technologies and equipment  research vessels and specially designed sensors and facilities. However  the proportion of gross domestic expenditure on research and development devoted to ocean science is decidedly smaller than that of other major fields of research and innovation. On average  only 1.2 per cent of national research budgets were allocated for ocean science between 2013 and 2017  with shares ranging from around 0.02 per cent to 9.5 per cent. This proportion is miniscule compared with the modestly estimated $1.5 trillion contribution of the ocean to the global economy in 2010. The United States of America reported the highest budget for ocean and coastal activities  a figure that includes ocean science  as well as other ocean and coastal government programmes ($12 billion)  followed by Japan ($600 million) and Australia ($511 million) in 2017.
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ocean science is still unknown. Immediate effects have included dramatic reductions in ocean observations with almost all research vessels called to home ports. Mooring arrays (buoys and moored systems with instruments and communication equipment) are at risk of failure  threatening long-lasting repercussions for international ocean research.
