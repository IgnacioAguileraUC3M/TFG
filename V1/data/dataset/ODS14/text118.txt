 Human activity is endangering the planet's largest ecosystem  its oceans and seas  and affecting the livelihoods of billions of people. Continuing ocean acidification and rising ocean temperatures are threatening marine species and negatively affecting marine ecosystem services. Between 2009 and 2018  for example  the world lost about 14 per cent of coral reefs  often called the  rainforests of the sea  because of the extraordinary biodiversity they support. The oceans are also under increasing stress from multiple sources of pollution  which is harmful to marine life and eventually makes its way into the food chain. The rapidly growing consumption of fish (an increase of 122 per cent between 1990 and 2018)  along with inadequate public policies for managing the sector  have led to depleting fish stocks. Combating the decline in ocean health requires intensified protection efforts and the adoption of solutions for a sustainable blue economy. This includes a  source-to-sea  approach that directly addresses the links between land  water  delta  estuary  coast  nearshore and ocean ecosystems in support of holistic natural resources management and economic development.
