 Life depends on oceans. They make up the planets largest ecosystem covering more than two thirds of the Earths surface and provide billions of people with food and livelihoods. Oceans produce about half the oxygen we breathe  and act as a climate regulator  absorbing atmospheric heat and more than one quarter of man-made CO2. However  decades of increasing carbon emissions have led to a build-up of heat in the oceans and changes in their chemical composition. The resulting adverse effects of ocean acidification  climate change (including sea-level rise)  extreme weather events and coastal erosion exacerbate ongoing threats to marine and coastal resources from overfishing  pollution and habitat degradation. Protected areas and policies and treaties that encourage responsible extraction of ocean resources are critical to confronting these threats.
