Global fish stocks are under increasing threat from overfishing and from illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing. More than a third (35.4 per cent) of global stocks were overfished in 2019  up from 34.2 per cent in 2017 and 10 per cent in 1974. However  the rate of decline has recently slowed. The Southeast Pacific now has the highest percentage of fish stocks at biologically unsustainable levels at 66.7 per cent  followed by the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea (63.3 per cent) and the Northwest Pacific (45 per cent). In contrast  the Eastern Central Pacific  Southwest Pacific  Northeast Pacific and Western Central Pacific had the lowest proportion (13 to 21 per cent) of stocks at unsustainable levels. Improved regulations  together with effective monitoring and surveillance  have been successful in reverting overfished stocks to biologically sustainable levels. However  the adoption of such measures has generally been slow  particularly in many developing countries  based on limited preliminary data collected in 2020.
