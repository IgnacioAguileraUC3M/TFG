In 2014  8.4 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under protection. Both developed and developing regions increased their protection of marine areas from 2000 to 2014. However  much of the increase was due to the establishment of large protected areas around a few countries and in sites not necessarily targeted for biodiversity. Consequently  marine protected areas are not evenly distributed  and the differences across regions are significant. In Oceania  the share of protected marine and coastal areas grew from 0.1 per cent in 2000 to 7.4 per cent in 2014the largest percentage among developing regions. To ensure that marine habitats and species are not lost  these protected areas need to be effectively managed and cover key biodiversity areas  which are sites significant for the global persistence of biodiversity. From 2000 to 2016  the share of marine key biodiversity areas that were completely covered by protected areas increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent.
