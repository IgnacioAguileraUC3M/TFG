
 More than 3 billion people rely on the ocean for their livelihoods  and over 80 per cent of world merchandise trade is carried out by sea. Oceans contribute to poverty eradication  sustained economic growth and food security. However  the benefits they provide are increasingly undermined by human activities. Rising CO2 emissions are driving ocean warming  acidification and deoxygenation  which threaten marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them  and are overwhelming the capacity of oceans to moderate climate change.
Overfishing depletes fish stocks  a third of which are already overexploited. Land-based pollutants  including plastic pollution and nutrient and sewage runoff  adversely affect coastal habitats and communities. These changes have long-term repercussions that require urgent scaling up of protection of marine environments  investment in ocean science  and support for small-scale fishing communities and the sustainable management of the oceans.
