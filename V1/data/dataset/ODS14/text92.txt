
 The ocean is the planets largest carbon sink  absorbing around 23 per cent of annual CO2 emissions generated by human activity and helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. However  the absorbed CO2 has caused seawater to become more acidic  evidenced by a 26 per cent drop in pH levels since pre-industrial times. Ocean acidification endangers coral reefs and other key species that are the base of the marine food chain  and has negative effects on marine ecosystem services  including fisheries and aquaculture  coastal protection  transportation and tourism. The more acidic the ocean becomes  the lower its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and to moderate climate change. Information drawn from a new ocean acidification data portal shows an increase in pH variability (up to 1030 per cent in the past five years) and in ocean acidity. By the end of this century  a 100150 per cent rise in acidity is projected  affecting half of all marine life.
