Since river basins  marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems  the effects of pollution are often felt far from their source. In many coastal communities  pollution and eutrophicationexcessive nutrients in water  frequently due to runoff from land  causing dense plant and algal growth and the death of animal life from lack of oxygenhave been key factors driving detrimental changes. According to the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme global comparative assessment in 2016  the five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication are the Bay of Bengal  East China Sea  Gulf of Mexico  North Brazil Shelf and South China Sea  areas which provided ecosystem services for coastal populations of 781 million in 2010.
