 Illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing threatens the social  economic and environmental sustainability of global fisheries; it also hinders countries ability to manage their fisheries effectively. Adopting and implementing relevant international instruments is key to curbing this destructive practice. As of 14 February 2020  the number of parties to the Agreement on Port State Measures  the first binding international agreement that specifically targets this type of fishing  increased to 66 (including the European Union)  up from 58 the year before.
 Based on their own reporting  countries have made good progress overall in carrying out the recommended measures to combat illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing. In 2020  close to 75 per cent scored high in their degree of implementation of relevant international instruments  compared with 70 per cent in 2018. But while impressive progress has been made  further concerted global action is required to ensure that illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing no longer represents a threat to the sustainability of fisheries worldwide.
