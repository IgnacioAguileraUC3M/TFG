 Marine protected areas are vital to the sustainable development of oceans. They safeguard vulnerable species and ecosystems  conserve biodiversity  and avert potential conflicts among users by delineating specific allowed activities. As of December 2019  over 17 per cent (or 24 million square kilometres) of waters under national jurisdiction (0 to 200 nautical miles from shore) were covered by protected areas. Coverage has increased significantly over the years  more than doubling since 2010. 
 Protected area networks must continue to expand to increase their coverage of key biodiversity areas (KBAs). The global mean percentage of each marine KBA covered by protected areas increased from 30.5 per cent in 2000 to 44.8 per cent in 2015 and 46.0 per cent in 2019. While this represents substantial progress  many KBAs have only partial or no protected area coverage. Least developed countries and small island developing States continue to lag behind at 25.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent  respectively.
