 The uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean changes the chemical composition of seawater  altering its carbonate chemistry and resulting in a decrease of pH (and growing ocean acidification). Observations of ocean pH over the past 30 years have shown a decrease in surface pH of 0.1 units. This is equivalent to a 26 per cent increase in acidity from pre-industrial times. At the current rate of CO2 emissions  an increase in acidity of 100 to 150 per cent by the end of this century is predicted. 
 Ocean acidification threatens organisms as well as ecosystem services  including food security  by endangering fisheries and aquaculture. It also impacts coastal protection (by weakening coral reefs  which shield the coastline)  transportation and tourism. As the acidity of the ocean rises  its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere decreases  hampering the oceans role in moderating climate change.
