 Coastal areas worldwide are affected by land-based pollutants  including sewage and nutrient runoff  leading to coastal eutrophication  degraded water quality and the impairment of coastal marine ecosystems. Analysis of the clean water indicator  a measurement of the degree of ocean pollution  shows that water quality challenges are widespread  but are most acute in some equatorial zones  especially in parts of Asia  Africa and Central America.
 Nearly all countries have room to improve their coastal water quality. Analysis of trends from 2012 to 2018 shows that positive change is indeed possible: 104 of 220 coastal regions improved their coastal water quality over that period. Such improvements require policy commitments at the country level to expand access to wastewater treatment and to reduce chemical and nutrient runoff from agricultural sources  along with global commitments to reduce plastic debris.
