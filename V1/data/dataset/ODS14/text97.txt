 The proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90.0 per cent in 1974 to 66.7 per cent in 2015 and 65.8 per cent in 2017. Despite this continued deterioration  the rate of decline has slowed in recent years. While encouraging  this will not be enough to prevent a medium-term collapse of certain global fisheries unless measures are more widely adopted to restore stocks to biologically sustainable levels. 
 In 2017  the Mediterranean and Black Sea continued to have the lowest percentage of stocks fished at sustainable levels (37.5 per cent)  followed by the Southeast Pacific (45.5 per cent) and Southwest Atlantic (46.7 per cent). In contrast  the Eastern Central Pacific  Southwest Pacific and Northeast Pacific had the highest proportion (above 83 per cent). Whereas the Southwest Pacific saw an improvement of 10.5 percentage points from 2015 levels  the Northwest Pacific and Northwest Atlantic experienced significant declines  of 17.3 and 17.7 percentage points  respectively.
