Sustainable fisheries play an important role in local economies and in food security. They accounted for about 0.10 per cent of global GDP in 2019  a share that has not changed significantly since 2011. In the small island developing States in Oceania and LDCs  this proportion rises to 1.5 per cent and 0.90 per cent of GDP  respectively  reflecting a greater dependence of the worlds poor on fishing. While some regions have seen the contribution of fisheries to GDP rise  other regions are facing human-induced external pressures on wild stocks. For instance  the declining sustainability of several stocks in the Pacific Ocean has led to a worsening trend overall for Eastern and South-Eastern Asia  where sustainable fisheries fell from 1.06 per cent of GDP in 2011 to 0.80 per cent in 2019. The sustainable management of fish stocks remains critical to ensuring that fisheries continue to generate economic growth and support equitable development into the future.
