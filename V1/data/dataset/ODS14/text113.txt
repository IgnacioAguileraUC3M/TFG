 The proliferation of plastic  nutrient run-off and other forms of waste is killing marine life  
 The main sources of marine pollution are land-based  leading to a seemingly unstoppable flow of litter  waste and run-off into the ocean. In 2021  a study estimated that more than 17 million metric tons of plastic entered the world's ocean  making up the bulk (85 per cent) of marine litter. The volume of plastic pollution entering the ocean each year is expected to double or triple by 2040  threatening all marine life. 
For coastal areas  eutrophication caused by nutrient pollution shows an increasing trend from 2016 to the present. This has resulted in a growing number of  dead zones  worldwide  from 400 in 2008 to around 700 in 2019. While COVID-19 may have reduced coastal pollution in some areas due to declining tourism and other activity  the pandemic does not appear to have eased coastal eutrophication globally. 
 Vast areas of the ocean are under protection  but more intensive efforts are still needed 
 Marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective  area-based measures to conserve biodiversity  including marine sanctuaries  parks and reserves  have seen substantial growth over the last decade. The global coverage of MPAs stood at 8 per cent  of global coastal waters and oceans in 2021. Recent designations of MPAs will raise this share  edging closer to the 10 per cent called for in the SDG and Aichi Biodiversity target. For example  a high-seas MPA that is vitally important for seabirds was recently designated in the North Atlantic  covering almost 600 000 square kilometres. 
It is important that protected areas are strategically located  in sites most critical to the conservation of nature  such as key biodiversity areas (KBAs). That said  more than half (55 per cent) of marine KBAs  on average  are still not safeguarded.
