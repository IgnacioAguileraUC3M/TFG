 Managing fish stocks sustainably is crucial to harnessing the benefits of fisheries and aquaculture to alleviate poverty  hunger and malnutrition  and to generate economic growth. In recent years  the contribution of sustainable fisheries to global GDP has hovered at around 0.1 per cent per year  reflecting the interplay of two opposing trends: the consistently rising value added of the fisheries and aquaculture sector  and the continued decline in the sustainability of global fish stocks. The contribution of sustainable marine capture fisheries to GDP has been markedly higher in small island developing States in Oceania and in LDCs  where fishing activities are vital for local communities and indigenous peoples. The share of sustainable fisheries in the GDP of these groups of countries averaged 1.55 per cent and 1.11 per cent  respectively  for the period 20112017.
