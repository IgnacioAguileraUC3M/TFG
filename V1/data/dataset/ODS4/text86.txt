
 Despite considerable progress in educational access and participation  262 million children and adolescents (6 to 17 years old) were still out of school in 2017. That represented nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group. Of that number  64 million were children of primary school age (about 6 to 11 years old)  61 million were adolescents of lower secondary school age (12 to 14 years old)  and 138 million were youth of upper secondary school age (15 to 17 years old).
 Girls still face barriers to education in most regions  particularly in Central Asia  Northern Africa and Western Asia  and sub-Saharan Africa. In those regions  girls of every age are more likely to be excluded from education than boys. For every 100 boys of primary-school age out of school in 2017  127 girls were denied the right to education in Central Asia  121 in sub-Saharan Africa  and 112 in Northern Africa and Western Asia. At the global level  118 girls were out of school for every 100 boys. Recent successes in reducing the number of children out of school and reducing the gender gap in the out-of-school rate need to be replicated worldwide to ensure all children  everywhere  are attending school.
