  Despite progress  the world failed to meet the MDG of  universal primary education by 2015. In 2013  the latest  year for which data are available  59 million children of primary school age and 65 million adolescents of lower secondary age were out of school. Most of them were girls. Survey data from 63 low- and middle-income countries between 2008 and 2012 show that children of primary school age from the poorest 20 per cent of households were more than four times as likely to be out of school as their richest peers. Children  especially girls  from households headed by someone with less than a primary education were more than four times as likely to be out of school as children from households headed by someone with a secondary or higher education.
