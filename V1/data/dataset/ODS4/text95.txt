
 During the COVID-19 pandemic  many schools are offering remote learning to students through virtual classrooms to mitigate the impact of school closures. While this is an option for some  it is out of reach for many. Lack of access to computers and the Internet at home  as well as a low level of computer-related skills  put many already marginalized students at a further disadvantage.
In 2019  around 87 per cent of households in Europe had Internet access at home  compared with 18 per cent of those in Africa. The digital divide is also reflected in computer ownership: 78 per cent of European households owned a computer in 2019 compared with 11 per cent in Africa.
Successful remote learning also depends on the computer skills of teachers and parents. In about half of the 86 countries for which data are available  less than half of the population possessed basic computer skills  such as copying an electronic file. For more complex skills  such as downloading and installing new software and writing a specialized computer program  the rates were even lower.
