
 One key to encouraging school enrolment and retention is ensuring adequate facilities and services. Yet  even basic school infrastructure is far from universal. In 2019-2020  about one quarter of primary schools worldwide lacked access to electricity  drinking water and basic sanitation facilities. Only half of primary schools had computers and Internet access or facilities that were fully accessible  including for children with disabilities. In all of these areas  LDCs lag furthest behind.
Recovering from the pandemic - and building back better - will require a significant investment in school infrastructure and services. According to a recent survey by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  about half of countries with data reported taking  significant additional measures  (as opposed to a  small-scale increase in measures ) in water  sanitation and hygiene services in schools after their reopening. This proportion remains similar across countries in various income groups. However  only 20 per cent of countries undertook significant measures to provide additional mental health and psychosocial support for students. This is disturbing considering the recent uptick in anxiety and depression among learners.
