
 Improving basic school infrastructure is critical for school reopening  a first step on the road to recovery from COVID-19. Data from 2016 to 2019 show that  globally  more than a fifth of primary schools lacked access to basic drinking water or single-sex toilets  more than a third lacked basic handwashing facilities  and one in four did not have electricity. Internet service and computers in schools are even more scarce. Schools in LDCs face the biggest challenges. Almost half of primary schools in LDCs lack single-sex toiletsan important factor in girls attendanceand more than two thirds are without electricity. The pandemic is spotlighting the importance of adequate sanitation facilities in keeping children safe at school and the need for ICT infrastructure to support remote learning. It is also highlighting additional infrastructure considerations  such as adequate classroom space  air filtration in school buildings  and access to the Internet and computers at home. The economic fallout of the crisis on education budgets and capital spending is likely to affect the ability of countries to make progress towards these ends  especially in the poorest countries.
