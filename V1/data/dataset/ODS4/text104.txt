
Pre-COVID-19 data for 20122020 drawn from 76 mostly low- and middle-income countries and territories show that around 7 in 10 children aged 3 and 4 years are developmentally on track. Participation in organized pre-primary learning (one year before the official age for primary school entry) rose steadily before the pandemic  from 65 per cent in 2010 to 73 per cent in 2019  with gender parity achieved in every region. However  considerable variation was found among regions. Participation in early learning in 2019 was 43 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa  compared with 96 per cent in Latin American and the Caribbean. This progress has been threatened since 2020  since childcare and early education facilities have closed in most countries. Many young children are now entirely reliant on their parents or other caregivers at home. Unsafe conditions  negative interactions with caregivers  and lack of adequate stimulation and learning opportunities during the early years can diminish childrens chances of success throughout their lives.
