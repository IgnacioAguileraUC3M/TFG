
For millions of children around the world  school is not only a place to learn. It is also a safe place  removed from violence  where they can receive free meals  and health and nutrition services such as vaccinations  deworming and iron supplementation. An estimated 379 million children missed out on school meals because of school closures during the pandemic. Without them  many children go hungry  which also threatens their immune systems and their capacity to cope with disease.
As studies from previous crises show  school closures and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 may also increase rates of violence against children  child labour  child marriage and early pregnancies. Children from poor families often work to compensate for lost family income. Moreover  the reduced productivity of working parents poses economic challenges to both the family and society.
The cost of fighting COVID-19 and the reduction in tax revenue caused by the economic downturn are likely to have a negative effect on education spending by governments and on global aid to education.
