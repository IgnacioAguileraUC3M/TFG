Of all regions  sub-Saharan Africa faces the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic resources. The situation is extreme at the primary and lower secondary levels  where less than one half of schools in sub-Saharan Africa have access to drinking water  electricity  computers and the Internet. At the upper secondary level  57 per cent of schools have electricity  but only 25 to 50 per cent have access to drinking water  handwashing facilities  computers and the Internet.
 Another important step towards the goal of good quality education for all is getting enough trained teachers into classrooms. Here again  sub-Saharan Africa lags behind. In 2017  that region had the lowest percentages of trained teachers in pre-primary (48 per cent)  primary (64 per cent) and secondary (50 per cent) education.
