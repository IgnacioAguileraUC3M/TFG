Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Nevertheless  millions of children are still out of school  and not all who do attend are learning. More than half of all children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. Disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes are found across regions  and sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and Southern Asia lag behind. As a result  many students are not fully prepared to participate in a highly complex global economy. That gap should provide the incentive for policymakers to refocus their efforts to ensure that the quality of education is improved  and that more people of all ages can access it.
