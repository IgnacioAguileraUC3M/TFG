
Lack of trained teachers and adequate facilities threaten quality education for all  especially in sub-Saharan Africa
In some regions  most notably sub-Saharan Africa  the lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools are jeopardising the goal of quality education for all. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of trained teachers in all three levels of schooling: 44 per cent in pre-primary  74 per cent in primary and 55 per cent in secondary education. Central Asia  in contrast  has the highest percentages (above 90 per cent) in all three levels of education.
In sub-Saharan Africa  schools often lack basic amenities long taken for granted in other parts of the world. Only around one quarter of schools in the region have electricity and less than half have access to basic drinking water. Although 69 per cent have toilets  many still lack separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys. Based on data from 65 developing countries  the median value of the percentage of schools  with access to computers and the Internet for pedagogical purposes is above 70 per cent in both primary and secondary education. However  the proportion drops below 40 per cent for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
