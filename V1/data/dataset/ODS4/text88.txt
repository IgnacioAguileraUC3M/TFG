
 Recent decades have seen improvements in basic reading and writing skills and a steady reduction in gender gaps  with womens literacy rates growing faster than mens literacy rates in all regions over the past 25 years. However  750 million adultstwo thirds of whom are womenremained illiterate in 2016. Adult literacy rates are lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Southern Asia alone is home to nearly half (49 per cent) of the global population who are illiterate.
 On a more positive note  youth literacy rates are generally higher than those of adults. This reflects increased access to schooling among younger generations  although many students with basic reading and writing skills still struggle to meet the higher standard of minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. The global literacy rate for adults (15 years of age and older) was 86 per cent in 2016  compared to 91 per cent for youth (15 to 24 years old). However  youth literacy remains low in several countries  most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
