Quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all are central to ensuring a full and productive life to all individuals and to the realization of sustainable development. Despite considerable progress in school enrolment  millions of children remain out of school  especially where educational systems struggle to keep up with population growth. Even when more children are enrolled  many do not acquire the basic skills. Quality education is hampered by the lack of trained teachers and adequate school facilities. Achieving this Goal will require intensified efforts  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia  targeted to vulnerable populations  specifically persons with disabilities  indigenous people  refugees and the rural poor.
