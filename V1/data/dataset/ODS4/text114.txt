
Over the years  education has become much more widely accessible. That said  inequalities in access persist among various socioeconomic groups. In 2020  for example  3 out of 4 children attended some form of organized learning one year before the official primary school age. Yet  participation was highly unequal: among countries with available data  disparities in attendance were found based on gender (39 per cent)  urban or rural location (76 per cent) and household wealth (86 per cent). The data showed that girls tend to score higher than boys in reading proficiency at the end of primary school. They also showed that children living in rural areas and in the poorest households are consistently more disadvantaged in term of educational participation and outcomes than their urban  wealthier peers.
School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have deepened inequality in education  with marginalized populations most affected. In the context of remote learning  for example  children from poorer backgrounds are less likely to have the devices and computer skills they need to get online  or a home environment conducive to learning. Ensuring a safe return to school and equity in education in the difficult transition period ahead needs to be a priority.
