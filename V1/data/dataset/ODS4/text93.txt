
Before the coronavirus crisis  the proportion of children and youth out of primary and secondary school had declined from 26 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent in 2010 and 17 per cent in 2018. Despite some progress  258 million children and youth were still out of school in 2018  of which three quarters lived in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Girls face more barriers than boys at the primary level. Globally  around 5.5 million more girls than boys of primary school age were out of school in 2018. The disadvantage girls face is more prominent in sub-Saharan Africa  where there were 128 girls for every 100 boys out of primary school that year. 
In 2020  as COVID-19 spreads across the globe  more than 190 countries have implemented nationwide school closures. About 90 per cent of all students (1.57 billion) were out of school. Although distance learning solutions are provided in four out of five countries with school closures  at least 500 million children and youth are currently excluded from these options. The sheer magnitude of school closures is likely to set back progress on access to education.
