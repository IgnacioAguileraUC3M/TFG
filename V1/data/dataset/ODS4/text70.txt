 Education for sustainable development and global citizenship addresses pressing and overarching requirements of society: living together and the relationship with nature. These are critical avenues for a sustainable and peaceful future for all.
Equitable access to TVET and higher education is also promoted. Although enrolments in TVET in upper secondary rose by one-third between 2000 and 2013  the share of TVET fell from 26 per cent to 22 per cent. Tertiary education has expanded rapidly over the same period with enrolments doubling globally and increasing by 2.5 times in developing regions with almost equal numbers of men and women enrolled. However  worldwide  in 2013  there were still 757 million adults unable to read and write  of whom two-thirds were women.
