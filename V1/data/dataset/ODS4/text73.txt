Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all are central to ensuring a full and productive life to all individuals and to the realization of sustainable development. Despite considerable progress in school enrolment  millions of children remain out of school  especially where educational systems struggle to keep up with population growth. Even when more children are enrolled  many do not acquire the basic skills. Quality education is hampered by the lack of trained teachers and adequate school facilities. Achieving this Goal will require intensified efforts  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia  targeted to vulnerable populations  specifically persons with disabilities  indigenous people  refugees and the rural poor.

  In the poorest countries  only 40 per cent of children participate in education one year before the start of primary school
   

  Early childhood is a critical period for a childs cognitive development. Organized learning before the official start of primary school has been shown to boost a childs social  emotional and intellectual development and support readiness for primary education and future learning. Pre-primary education is  in fact  considered an important part of a holistic and robust educational system. In 2014  two thirds of children worldwide participated in pre-primary or primary education in the year prior to the official entrance age to primary school. However  in sub-Saharan Africa  the least developed countries (LDCs) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs)  the rate was only 4 in 10 children  versus 9 in 10 children in Europe and Northern America  and Latin America and the Caribbean.

      Despite progress in enrolment  more than a quarter of a billion school-aged children  adolescents and youth are not in school
    
Despite considerable progress in primary school enrolment between 2000 and 2014  9 per cent of primary-school-aged children worldwide were still out of school in 2014. The rate has stagnated since 2008  reflecting pockets of exclusion and hard-to-reach populations. The out-of-school rates for lower and upper secondary-school-aged adolescents and youth decreased  but remain higher than for primary-school-aged children  reflecting the difficulty in keeping pupils in school and the fact that youth have fewer opportunities to enter school   in the first place.  
As a result  about 263 million children  adolescents and youth were out of school in 2014. Of these  61 million were children of primary school age  60 million were adolescents of lower secondary school age  and 142 million were youth of upper secondary school age. They largely resided in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia  where educational systems struggle to keep up with population growth. In fact  these two regions accounted for over 70 per cent of the global out-of-school population at every level.

      Poverty  gender and location of residence all influence reading proficiency
    

    Even though more children than ever are going to school  many do not acquire basic skills. For example  only about half of students at the end of primary education have attained minimum proficiency levels in reading or mathematics in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.
    

    Results of recent reading assessments show that inequity constitutes a major challenge. Parity indices from the assessments revealed that children and adolescents from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading than those from the poorest 20 per cent of households  and urban children scored higher than rural children. The indices also showed that while out-of-school rates are higher for school-aged girls than boys  girl students had better reading proficiency at the end of primary and lower secondary school than their male counterparts.

Lack of trained teachers and adequate facilities threaten quality education for all  especially in sub-Saharan Africa
In some regions  most notably sub-Saharan Africa  the lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools are jeopardising the goal of quality education for all. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of trained teachers in all three levels of schooling: 44 per cent in pre-primary  74 per cent in primary and 55 per cent in secondary education. Central Asia  in contrast  has the highest percentages (above 90 per cent) in all three levels of education.
In sub-Saharan Africa  schools often lack basic amenities long taken for granted in other parts of the world. Only around one quarter of schools in the region have electricity and less than half have access to basic drinking water. Although 69 per cent have toilets  many still lack separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys. Based on data from 65 developing countries  the median value of the percentage of schools  with access to computers and the Internet for pedagogical purposes is above 70 per cent in both primary and secondary education. However  the proportion drops below 40 per cent for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
