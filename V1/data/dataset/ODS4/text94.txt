
Goal 4 aims to keep children in school and ensure they complete their education. The global primary school completion rate was estimated at 85 per cent in 2019  up from 70 per cent in 2000. The lower and upper secondary school rates were 73 per cent and 49 per cent  respectively  with large disparities among population groups. For example  in low-income countries  the primary completion rate is 34 per cent for children from the poorest 20 per cent of households and 79 per cent for children from the richest 20 per cent of households. Similar disparities were found in completion rates for lower secondary and upper secondary schools.
Months of absence from school owing to COVID-19 are likely to impact education outcomes. In the longer term  prolonged absence from school is associated with lower retention and graduation rates and worse learning outcomes  in particular among segments of the population that are already disadvantaged  including members of poor households and students with disabilities.
