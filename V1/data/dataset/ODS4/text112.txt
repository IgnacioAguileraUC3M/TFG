
COVID-related school closures threaten to reverse years of progress aimed at keeping children in school. Before the pandemic  17 per cent of children and youth globally were out of primary and secondary school  compared to 26 per cent in 2000. From March 2020 through February 2022  schools worldwide were fully or partially closed for 41 weeks  on average. Latin America and the Caribbean experienced the longest school closures - more than 60 weeks in the past two years.
The longer children are out of school  the less likely they are to return. According to a 2020 report by the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  24 million learners from the pre-primary to university level are at risk of not returning to school. Students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are at higher risk due to socioeconomic factors such as the need to generate income  increased care responsibilities  and early and forced marriage. Those who were unable to access distance learning during confinement are also at higher risk of not returning to school.
