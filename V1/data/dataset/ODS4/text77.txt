    Even though more children than ever are going to school  many do not acquire basic skills. For example  only about half of students at the end of primary education have attained minimum proficiency levels in reading or mathematics in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.
    

    Results of recent reading assessments show that inequity constitutes a major challenge. Parity indices from the assessments revealed that children and adolescents from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading than those from the poorest 20 per cent of households  and urban children scored higher than rural children. The indices also showed that while out-of-school rates are higher for school-aged girls than boys  girl students had better reading proficiency at the end of primary and lower secondary school than their male counterparts.

      Note: Parity indices below 1 indicate  a comparative advantage for the sub-population shown in the lower segment of each graph (i.e.  boys  urban and richest 20 per cent). Parity is assumed to occur in the range 0.97-1.03.
