
Progress to ensure that all children complete primary and secondary school has been slow.  Between 2010 and 2019  the global primary and secondary school completion rates increased from 82 per cent to 85 per cent and from 46 per cent to 53 per cent  respectively. In sub-Saharan Africa  the primary completion rate rose from 57 per cent in 2010 to 64 per cent in 2019  while the secondary rate grew from 26 per cent to 29 per cent  leaving that region furthest behind. 
Large disparities among population groups remain pervasive. Almost half of countries with data did not reach gender parity in primary school completion. Disparities by location and wealth are even more stark: only a third of countries reached parity in primary school completion between rural and urban students  and just one sixth of countries reached parity between students in the poorest and richest households. The pandemic is expected to further slow or even reverse progress in education completion. Growing poverty and the shift to remote learning make children from the poorest households and other vulnerable groups less equipped to participate and more likely to drop out permanently or for extended periods.
