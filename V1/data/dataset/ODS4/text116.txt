Online schooling offers Ukrainian children a sense of normalcy in the chaos of war
The war in Ukraine is having a particularly damaging effect on its youngest citizens. As of May 2022  two-thirds of the country's children had been displaced from their homes  some 130 educational institutions had been destroyed and more than 1 500 schools damaged. In spite of these challenges  education in Ukraine goes on: remote learning  often interrupted by air-raid sirens  has been offered to millions. In April 2022  nearly 3 million children (the majority of school-aged students) showed up for online classes. Video lessons have also been broadcast on television. Remote schooling provides a safe  space  and a semblance of normalcy for children affected by war. It also serves as a lifeline  providing children with access to information on the risks of deadly explosive ordnance  for example  and connects them and their parents to essential health and psychosocial services.
Millions of children and youth worldwide are in similar situations as those in Ukraine whose learning has been interrupted - by war  disasters and other crises. Providing safe  inclusive and continuous education to those girls and boys is crucial in helping them cope with current and future crises. It is one of the soundest and most important investments that can be made in human and socioeconomic development.
