
 Lack of basic handwashing facilities in many schools around the world means that teachers and students do not enjoy a safe learning environment. In areas where schools are closed because of the pandemic  it also means that they will be unable to practice essential hygiene measures when they go back to school. According to the latest available data  only 65 per cent of primary schools worldwide have basic handwashing facilities. The proportion is slightly higher for lower secondary and upper secondary schools  at 71 per cent and 76 per cent  respectively. Of all regions  sub-Saharan Africa faces the biggest challenges  with basic handwashing facilities in only 38 per cent of primary schools and 43 per cent of upper secondary schools.
Many schools also lack other basic resources  such as electricity  clean drinking water  computers and Internet access. Globally  89 per cent of upper secondary schools have access to electricity  85 per cent to basic drinking water  74 per cent to computers and 61 per cent to the Internet. Those in sub-Saharan Africa are the most disadvantaged: only 57 per cent of upper secondary schools have access to electricity  55 per cent to drinking water  41 per cent to computers and 24 per cent to the Internet.
One important step towards the goal of quality education for all is getting enough trained teachers into classrooms. According to the latest available data  85 per cent of primary school teachers and 86 per cent of secondary school teachers worldwide received the minimum required training. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of trained teachers: 64 per cent at the primary level and 50 per cent at the secondary level.
