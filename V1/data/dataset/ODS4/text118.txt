The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened a crisis in education  with severe disruptions in education systems worldwide. School closures have had worrisome consequences for children's learning and well-being  particularly for girls and those who are disadvantaged  including children with disabilities  rural dwellers and ethnic minorities. An estimated 147 million children missed more than half of their in-person instruction over the past two years. As a result  this generation of children could lose a combined total of $17 trillion in lifetime earnings (in current value). Governments need to implement ambitious programmes to ensure that all children return to school  recover their learning losses  and have their psychosocial needs met.
