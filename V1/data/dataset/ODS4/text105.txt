Prior to the pandemic  the average participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education was only 25 per cent  with significant variation across the 73 countries with data. In nearly half of them  participation rates were below 10 per cent  but were 40 per cent and above among countries in Europe and Northern America. Gender parity in participation rates was achieved in less than a fifth of the countries.
With schools and workspaces transitioning online due to COVID-19  information and communication (ICT) skills have become critically important. However  available data from 20172019  indicate that less than 40 per cent of youth and adults reported performing one of the basic ICT skills in the last three months  such as sending an email with an attachment. Large differences in skill levels are found among various groups and occupations  but relatively smaller gender differences  especially at younger ages.
