COVID19 has wreaked havoc worldwide on childrens learning and well-being. Before the pandemic  progress in education was already too slow to achieve Goal 4 by 2030. One year into the crisis  two in three students were still affected by full or partial school closures. One hundred million more children than before fail to demonstrate basic reading skills. The poorest and most vulnerable children are bearing the brunt of the crisis  exacerbating longstanding inequalities. Many risk never returning to school; some are forced into child marriage or child labour. Special efforts are required to recover learning losses caused by COVID-19. However  an estimated 65 per cent of Governments in low- and lower-middle-income countries  and 35 per cent in upper-middle- and high-income countries have reduced funding for education since the onset of the pandemic.
