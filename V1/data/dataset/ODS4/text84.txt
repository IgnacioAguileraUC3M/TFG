
Globally  an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school agemore than 55 per cent of the global totallacked minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics in 2015. One third of those children and adolescents were out of school and urgently needed access to education. About two thirds of them attended school but did not become proficient  either because they dropped out or because they did not learn basic skills. Despite years of steady growth in enrolment rates  nonproficiency rates remain disturbingly high. They are highest in sub-Saharan Africa  where 88 per cent of children (202 million) of primary and lower secondary school age were not proficient in reading  and 84 per cent (193 million) were not proficient in mathematics in 2015. Central and Southern Asia was not faring significantly better. There  81 per cent of children (241 million) were not proficient in reading  and 76 per cent (228 million) lacked basic mathematical skills. 
Girls are more likely than boys to learn how to read. Globally  for every 100 boys who achieved minimum proficiency in reading in 2015  105 girls of primary school age and 109 adolescent women of lower secondary school age met at least the minimum standard.
The learning crisis not only threatens an individuals ability to climb out of poverty  it also jeopardizes the economic future of entire nations as they struggle to compete in a global marketplace with less-than-skilled human resources. The next decade provides an important window of opportunity for policymakers to ensure that all children are proficient in basic literacy and numeracy.
