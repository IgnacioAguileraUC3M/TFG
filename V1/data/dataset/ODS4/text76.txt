Despite considerable progress in primary school enrolment between 2000 and 2014  9 per cent of primary-school-aged children worldwide were still out of school in 2014. The rate has stagnated since 2008  reflecting pockets of exclusion and hard-to-reach populations. The out-of-school rates for lower and upper secondary-school-aged adolescents and youth decreased  but remain higher than for primary-school-aged children  reflecting the difficulty in keeping pupils in school and the fact that youth have fewer opportunities to enter school   in the first place.  
As a result  about 263 million children  adolescents and youth were out of school in 2014. Of these  61 million were children of primary school age  60 million were adolescents of lower secondary school age  and 142 million were youth of upper secondary school age. They largely resided in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia  where educational systems struggle to keep up with population growth. In fact  these two regions accounted for over 70 per cent of the global out-of-school population at every level.
