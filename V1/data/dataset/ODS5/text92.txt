The coronavirus pandemic lockdowns have confined many women and girls to their homes  sometimes with abusive partners  putting them at greater risk of domestic violence. Even before the pandemic  physical and sexual violence against women were all too common. According to surveys conducted between 2005 and 2017 in 106 countries  18 per cent of ever-partnered women and girls 15 to 49 years of age experienced such violence by a current or former intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey.
Already  data from several countries show an increase in reporting of domestic violence to helplines  womens refuges and shelters  and the police. When considering such data  it is important to keep in mind that less than 40 per cent of women who experience violence report this crime or seek help. Being confined at home with an abusive partner and  in some countries  lacking access to mobile phones or the Internet  makes it more difficult for women to safely reach out for help. According to data from 66 countries over the period 2016 to 2018  mobile phone ownership among women was 6.8 percentage points lower than for men  on average. Women are also more likely to have their phones monitored by abusive or controlling partners. In addition  because of service disruptions and closures  women experiencing violence have less access to support and may not seek or be able to receive medical care  if needed.
