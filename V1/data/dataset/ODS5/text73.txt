Target 3.7 calls for universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services (including family planning)  information and education  which should help to prevent adolescent childbearing and unintended pregnancies.

    Reducing the adolescent birth rate is integral to the health and well-being of adolescent girls and to their social and economic prospects. Globally  childbearing among adolescents declined by 21 per cent between 2000 and 2015. Central and Southern Asia made the greatest progress: the region reduced the adolescent birth rate by more than 50 per cent  largely due to advances in Southern Asia. Rates remain highest in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean  despite progress in both regions.
