 The world is a better place for women today than it was in the past. Fewer girls are forced into early marriage; more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership; and laws are being reformed to advance gender equality. Despite these gains  discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive  along with harmful practices and other forms of violence against women and girls. Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the globe  women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work. Moreover  they continue to face barriers with respect to their sexual and reproductive health and rights  including legal restrictions and lack of autonomy in decision-making. Among the most disadvantaged are women and girls who face the compounded effects of gender and other forms of discrimination. Achieving gender equality will require bold and sustainable actions that address the structural impediments and root causes of discrimination against women. Equally important  it will require laws and policies that advance gender equality  backed by adequate resources  as well as stronger accountability for commitments made to women's rights.
