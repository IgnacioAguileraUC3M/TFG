Owning rights to land  specifically agricultural land  reduces womens reliance on male partners and relatives. Yet  in 30 countries  less than half of women had ownership and/or secure tenure rights over agricultural land  according to 20092020 data from 36 countries. In 18 of these countries  the share of men having ownership was twice that of women. Gender-responsive policy and legal frameworks are essential to advancing womens rights to land. However  only 15 out of 52 reporting countries included sufficient provisions in their legal frameworks to offer women good protection in this regard. The most prominent areas in which positive results have been achieved are in succession rights and in protection from being disposed in land transactions.

      Accelerated progress is needed to align public financing with gender equality objectives
    
Building back better from COVID-19 means doing so in a way that advances gender equality and womens empowerment. Fundamental to this goal is ensuring that the allocation and spending of public financing takes gender equality into account. According to data reported by 105 countries and areas for the period 20182021  only 26 per cent of countries have comprehensive systems in place to track public allocations for gender equality  59 per cent have some features of such a system  and 15 per cent do not have the minimum elements of such a system. Accelerated action is needed to expand comprehensive implementation of gender-responsive budgeting and strengthen its monitoring and evaluation.
