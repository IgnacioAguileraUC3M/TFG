Discriminatory laws and legal gaps continue to prevent women from enjoying their full human rights  based on data collected in 95 countries across four areas of law in 2020. In the area of overarching legal frameworks and public life  more than half of the countries with data lacked quotas for women in national parliaments  and close to one fifth maintained discriminatory nationality laws. In the area of violence against women  83 per cent of countries included budgetary commitments to implement legislation addressing violence against women  but 63 per cent lacked rape laws based on the principle of consent. In the area of employment and economic benefits  over 90 per cent of countries mandated non-discrimination on the basis of gender in employment  but almost half of them continued to restrict women from working in certain jobs or industries. In the area of marriage and family  almost a quarter of countries failed to grant women equal rights with men to enter into marriage and initiate divorce  and three quarters of countries did not stipulate 18 years as the minimum age of marriage for women and men  with no exceptions.
