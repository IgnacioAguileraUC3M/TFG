 On average  women spend roughly triple the amount of time that men do each day in unpaid care and domestic work  according to the latest available data from around 90 countries. That work includes a variety of unpaid activities  such as taking care of children and the elderly  and domestic chores. Data also suggest that the gender gap widens when women are most likely to have young children at home. 
 Inadequate cookstoves  water  sanitation and transportation increase womens burdens  as do the lack of early childhood education and care  long-term care and access to social protection and services. That burden is compounded by traditional notions of womens roles in society. When women are engaged in caregiving and domestic chores  they have less time for paid work  education and leisure  further reinforcing their socioeconomic disadvantage.
