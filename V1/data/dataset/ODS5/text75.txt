The average amount of time women spend on unpaid domestic work and caregiving at home is almost triple that of men  according to survey data from 83 countries and areas.

    Data for a subset of countries (mainly from Latin American and European countries) suggest this disparity widens during periods when women are most likely to have young children at home. Women dedicate more time than men caring for family members  especially children. This activity often overlaps with domestic duties  making it difficult to capture accurately in time-use surveys.
Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work  women and men  2000-2016 (latest available) (percentage of time spent per day)
Note: The figure reflects available data for 83 countries and areas over the period 2000-2016. Data disaggregated by unpaid domestic work and unpaid care work are only available for 71 countries. The number of countries and areas represented in each type of unpaid work is indicated in parentheses.
