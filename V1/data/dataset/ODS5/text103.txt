On an average day  women spend about 2.5 times as many hours on unpaid domestic work and care work as men  according to data from 90 countries and areas collected between 2001 and 2019. Both women and men have increased their unpaid workloads during the crisis  but women are doing a disproportionate share. Moreover  more women than men are leaving the workforce to provide childcare. In a 16-country study  the amount of time spent on childcare has increased for both women (from 26 hours a week before the pandemic to 31 hours after) and men (from 20 hours a week to 24 hours). Evidence from Brazil  Chile  Costa Rica and Mexico shows that partnered women with children have experienced sharper drops in labour force participation than men  particularly women living with children under 6 years of age.
