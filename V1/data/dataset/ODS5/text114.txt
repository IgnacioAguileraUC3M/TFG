Only 57 per cent of women aged 15 to 49 who are married or in a union make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations  contraceptive use and reproductive health care  according to data from 64 countries for the period 20072021. Critical to this decision-making ability is the extent to which laws prevent or enable access to relevant health care and information. Among 115 countries with data  countries had in place an average of 76 per cent of the laws and regulations needed to guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely having a significant impact on womens ability to exercise their bodily autonomy. In the first year of the pandemic  an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies occurred in lower- and middle-income countries. This could be due to several factors. Women may have experienced financial hardships that prevented them from making their own decisions to seek health care and contraception. During lockdown periods  women may have found it harder to say no to sex due to increased tensions in the home related to health  finance and social isolation. Finally  disruption or suspension of sexual and reproductive health care may have made these essential services inaccessible to women.
