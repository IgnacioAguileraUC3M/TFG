The pandemic has exacerbated gender inequalities and threatens to undermine progress on womens empowerment. More than ever  women are needed as equal partners in crafting gender-responsive laws  policies and budgets to build back better and ensure a gender transformative agenda in both private and public spheres. However  as of 1 January 2021  womens representation was far from parity: the global average of women in single or lower chambers of national parliaments was only 25.6 per cent  and 36.3 per cent in local deliberative bodies  continuing a slow upward trend. At the current rate  it will take no fewer than 40 years to achieve gender parity in national parliaments. Only 23 countries have at least 40 per cent female representation in their lower or single chambers of parliament; 22 countries in local government. Most achieved such progress through the use of gender quotas. In 2020  the share of parliamentary seats won by women in countries with legislated quotas was 27.4 per cent  compared with 15.6 per cent in countries with no quota systems. At the local level  use of legislated quotas increased a countrys representation of women by 7 percentage points.
Though women accounted for nearly 39 per cent of the global labour force in 2019  they occupied only 28.2 per cent of managerial positions  only 3 percentage points higher than in 2000. The pandemics disproportional impact on women in the workforce  and especially on women entrepreneurs  threatens to roll back the little progress that has been made in reducing the global gender gap in managerial positions.
