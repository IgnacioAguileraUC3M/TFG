Womens ownership or control of land is critical to their economic empowerment. Land ownership gives rise to a host of benefits for women through an increase in their bargaining power within households and the economy. These benefits are not limited to women. Studies suggest that if women had equal access to land  poverty and food insecurity would be significantly reduced around the world.
That vision is far from realized. In most countries  less than 50 per cent of women and men engaged in agriculture have ownership or secure tenure rights over agricultural land. In 9 of the 10 countries assessed  relatively few women have such rights compared to men. It is not always the case that landowners who are men outnumber landowners who are women  but this is by far the most common situation  found in 7 out of the 10 countries for which data are available. In five of these countries  men outnumber women in land ownership by at least two to one.
