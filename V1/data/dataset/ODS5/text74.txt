  where it persists as a social norm. The practice can cause severe pain  excessive bleeding  infections (including HIV)  infertility 
  complications during childbirth and sometimes death. The exact number of girls and women affected globally is unknown  but at least
  200 million have been subjected to FGM in the 30 countries (half of them in Western Africa) where the practice is concentrated and that
  have nationally representative prevalence data.

    Prevalence rates for this harmful practice have declined by 24 per cent since around 2000  with some countries making rapid progress. FGM remains widespread in other countries with data. On average  more than one in three girls aged 15 to 19 have been subjected to FGM in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated  compared to nearly one in two around 2000.
