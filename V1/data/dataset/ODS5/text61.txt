Globally  the proportion of women aged 20 to 24 who reported that they were married before their eighteenth birthdays dropped from 32 per cent around 1990 to 26 per cent around 2015. Child marriage is most common in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  with rates of 44 per cent and 37 per cent  respectively. In fact  the 10 countries with the highest rates in the world are found in these two regions. Marriage rates for girls under age 15 are also highest in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  at 16 per cent and 11 per cent  respectively. But social norms can and do change: the marriage of girls under age 15 declined globally from 12 per cent in 1990 to 7 per cent today  although disparities persist across regions and even countries. The fastest progress in reducing child marriage overall has been recorded in Northern Africa  where the share of child brides dropped by more than half over the last 25 years  from 29 per cent to 13 per cent.
