 As of 1 January 2019  womens representation in national parliaments ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent  averaging 24.3 per cent. This is an increase of 5 percentage points since 2010. In 103 countries and areas with relevant data  womens representation in elected local deliberative bodies varied from less than 1 per cent to close to parity  at 50 per cent  with a median of 26 per cent. Womens representation in local government is 40 per cent or higher in only 15 countries and areas. When legislated gender quotas are adopted  significantly higher proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels. Countries with higher representation of women in local government tend to have higher representation in parliament. 
 In the economic sphere  the world has seen an upward trend in the proportion of women in managerial positions. Since 2000  that share has increased in all regions and country groupings  except in least developed countries. However  it remains disproportionately low. Women comprised 39 per cent of the workforce in 2018  but held only 27 per cent of managerial positions.
 That lack of decision-making power is reflected in the home as well. According to data from 51 countries  only 57 per cent of women 15 to 49 years old who are married or in a union make their own decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and reproductive health services. Womens and girls capacity to make those crucial decisions for themselvesand to be able to act on themis essential to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights.
