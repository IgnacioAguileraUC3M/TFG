 Over the past 25 years  progress has been made in gender equality through the creation of new legislation and the reform of existing laws. Still  troublesome gaps remain. This was the conclusion of a study of data collected in 2018 and covering four areas of law in 53 countries. In almost one third of the countries studied  gaps were found in overarching legal frameworks and areas of public life. For example  nearly two thirds of those countries lacked laws that covered both direct and indirect discrimination against women. In the area of violence against women  legal gaps were found in over one quarter of the countries studied. Of those countries  68 per cent lacked rape laws based on the principle of consent. In the areas of employment and economic benefits  and of marriage and family  29 per cent and 24 per cent of countries  respectively  had legal gaps. For example  in more than half of the countries  no laws were in place to mandate equal pay for work of equal value. Less than one third of the countries had laws stipulating 18 years as the minimum age of marriage for women and men  with no exceptions.
