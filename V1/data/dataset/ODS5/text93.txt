Marriage before the age of 18 is a human rights violation  mostly affecting girls  and can lead to a lifetime of disadvantage and deprivation. One in five women (20.2 per cent) between the ages of 20 and 24 was married before the age of 18 around 2019  compared with about one in four (23.8 per cent) 10 years earlier. Southern Asia has seen the greatest decline over this period. Today  the risk of child marriage is highest in sub-Saharan Africa  where more than one in three women (34.5 per cent) between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before the age of 18. School closures and widening poverty as a result of the pandemic could put more girls at risk.
FGM is another blatant violation of human rights. At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM in 31 countries where the practice is concentrated; half of these countries are in Western Africa. Although this harmful practice has been declining  there are still countries where FGM is almost universal  where at least 9 in 10 girls and women aged 15 to 49 years have been cut. Even in countries where the practice has become less common  progress would need to accelerate by a factor of 10 to meet the global target of elimination by 2030  owing to population growth. COVID-19 is interrupting programmes to end FGM  which could threaten progress.
