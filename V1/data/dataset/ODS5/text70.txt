When perpetrated by an intimate partner  violence can be especially traumatic and debilitating. According to surveys undertaken between 2005 and 2016 in 87 countries (including 30 from developed regions)  19 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 said they experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey.

    The prevalence of violence against women varies within and among regions. Levels of intimate partner violence are highest in Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand  ranging from 19 to 44 per cent in countries with data. Prevalence is lower overall in Europe  with levels of less than 10 per cent in most of the 29 countries with available data.

    In the most extreme cases  violence against women and girls can result in death. In 2012  almost half of all women who were victims of intentional homicide worldwide were killed by an intimate partner or family member  compared to 6 per cent of male victims.

    Social acceptability and widespread impunity for perpetrators are among the main challenges contributing to violence against women. In 37 countries  for example  perpetrators of rape are exempted from prosecution if they are married to or subsequently marry the victim.
