 The world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030  and the social and economic fallout from the pandemic has made the situation even bleaker. Progress in many areas  including time spent on unpaid care and domestic work  decision-making regarding sexual and reproductive health  and gender-responsive budgeting  is falling behind. Womens health services  already poorly funded  have faced major disruptions. Violence against women remains endemic. And despite womens leadership in responding to COVID-19  they still trail men in securing the decision-making positions they deserve. Commitment and bold action are needed to accelerate progress  including through the promotion of laws  policies  budgets and institutions that advance gender equality. Greater investment in gender statistics is vital  since less than half of the data required to monitor Goal 5 are currently available.
