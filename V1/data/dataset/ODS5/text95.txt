As of 1 January 2020  womens representation in national parliaments (lower chamber and unicameral parliaments) had reached 24.9 per cent  up from 22.3 per cent in 2015. The share of female representation ranged from more than 30 per cent in Australia and New Zealand  Latin America and the Caribbean  and Europe to only 6.2 per cent in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand). Data from 133 countries and areas show that women now have better access to decision-making positions at the local level  holding 36.3 per cent of elected seats in local deliberative bodies. Only 13 per cent and 15 per cent of countries  respectively  have reached gender balance (40 per cent or more) in legislative bodies in national parliaments and in local government. This progress is largely attributed to legislated gender quotas.
In 2019  women represented 39 per cent of the worlds workers and half of the worlds working-age population  but only 28 per cent of managerial positions (up from 25 per cent in 2000). Women face higher barriers than men in accessing employment. And when they do get a job  they are often excluded from decision-making positions. In 2019  women accounted for 41 per cent of managerial positions in South-Eastern Asia and 40 per cent in Northern America  but only 8 per cent in Northern Africa.
In the context of COVID-19  it is critical that women are fairly represented in leadership positions related to the pandemic. This will help to avoid deepening existing inequalities. It will also ensure that gender dimensions and investments in gender equality are included in response and recovery legislation  economic packages and budgets during and after the pandemic.
