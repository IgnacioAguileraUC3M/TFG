Nearly one in three women (736 million) have been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence at least once since the age of 15  usually by an intimate partner. Intimate partner violence starts early. Among girls and women who have ever been married or had a partner  nearly 24 per cent of those aged 15 to 19 years have been subjected to such violence  as have 26 per cent of those aged 20 to 24.
Disparities in intimate partner violence are found across regions  with consistently higher prevalence in low- and lower-middle-income regions compared with high-income regions. These variations are likely to reflect the challenges that women often face in leaving abusive relationships  such as insufficient economic resources  limited availability and access to formal support services  weak social support networks  and fear of repercussions associated with social stigma. The current pandemic has heightened the challenges of women in abusive relationships.
