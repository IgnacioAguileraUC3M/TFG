In an average day  women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men  according to the latest data from 89 countries and areas between 2001 and 2018. Time spent in these activities tends to be even higher for women with young children at home. In roughly 75 per cent of countries with trend data  a small decrease has been observed in the time spent by women on unpaid domestic and care work compared with that spent by men.
The COVID-19 crisis is radically changing how people  particularly women  spend their time  often with a negative impact on their well-being. A poll conducted in 17 countries shows that both women and men are taking more responsibility for household chores and the care of children and family during the lockdown  but the majority of work continues to fall on women and girls  reflecting a pre-pandemic pattern.
