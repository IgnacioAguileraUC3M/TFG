
 Gender budgeting aims to link policy and legal requirements for gender equality with resource allocation. Although progress has been made in implementing gender budgeting globally  significant gaps remain. For example  many countries have yet to establish a comprehensive system to track allocations for gender equality and to make data publicly available. An analysis of 2018 data from 69 countries and areas found that 13 countries (19 per cent) fully met those criteria  and 41 countries (59 per cent) approached the requirements. More often  countries issue directives on gender budgeting  use sex-disaggregated data to inform budget decisions  and conduct ex-post-impact assessments. The data also revealed a gap in policy implementation. Among the same set of countries  90 per cent had policies and programmes in place to address gender gaps  but only 43 per cent reported adequate resource allocations to implement them.
