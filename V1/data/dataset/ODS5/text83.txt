 Women and girls around the world continue to experience violence and cruel practices that strip them of their dignity and erode their well-being. Intimate partner violence affects women of all ages and ethnicities  regardless of their socioeconomic status and educational level  in all countries. According to the latest available data from 106 countries  18 per cent of ever-partnered women and girls 15 to 49 years old experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. 
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a deeply troubling human-rights violation that affects at least 200 million women in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated (half of them in West Africa). On average  the prevalence of FGM has declined by one quarter since around 2000. Still  on average  about one in three girls 15 to 19 years old in those countries have been subjected to FGM  compared to nearly one in two in 2000.
 Child marriageanother harmful practicehas continued to decline around the world  largely driven by progress in Southern Asia. There  a girls risk of marrying in childhood has decreased by over 40 per cent since 2000. Increasingly  the global burden of child marriage is shifting from Southern Asia to sub-Saharan Africa  where levels of child marriage have declined at a more modest rate.
