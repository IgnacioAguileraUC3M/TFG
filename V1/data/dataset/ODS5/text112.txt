Violence against women and girls is found in all countries and affects women of all ages. Globally  26 per cent of ever-partnered women aged 15 and older (641 million) have been subjected to physical and/ or sexual violence by a husband or intimate partner at least once in their lifetime. Limited evidence points to an intensification of violence against women during the pandemic. A 2021 rapid gender assessment survey in 13 countries  undertaken by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women)  found that 45 per cent of women reported that they or a woman they know has experienced some form of violence since COVID-19.
Global awareness of violence against older women specifically is growing  but data on the subject are limited  and the nature  scale  severity and complexity of such violence may be underestimated. Less than 10 per cent of eligible data on intimate partner violence capture the prevalence of such violence among women aged 50 and older. Limited evidence from 20002018 found that 4 per cent and 7 per cent of women in this age group experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the last 12 months. Older women  however  may be vulnerable to specific forms of violence not usually measured in surveys on violence against women  such as economic exploitation  or being ostracized or neglected.
Perpetrators of such violence  aside from intimate partners  can include adult children and other relatives  strangers  caregivers and neighbours.
