Over the past decade  the practice of child marriage has declined significantly  with the global proportion of young women who were married as children decreasing by 15 per cent  from nearly one in four to one in five. As a result  the marriages of some 25 million girls have been averted. However  the profound effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are putting girls at higher risk of early marriage due to a combination of economic shocks  school closures and interruptions in reproductive health services. Over the next decade  up to 10 million more girls will be at risk of child marriage as a result of the pandemic  in addition to the 100 million who were projected to become child brides before. Most child marriages due to the pandemic are expected to occur in the near term  though the impact is likely to be felt for at least the next decade.
