Typically  child brides have limited opportunities for education and employment  are at increased risk of domestic violence and other assaults to their physical and mental health  and have little decision-making power within the household  especially when married to older men.

    The practice of child marriage has been slowly declining. Around 2015  just over one in four women between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before the age of 18; around 2000  the ratio was one in three. Faster progress has been made in delaying the marriage of girls under age 15  which declined from 11 per cent around 2000 to 8 per cent around 2015. That said  progress has been uneven across regions and countries.

    In Southern Asia  the proportion of women married before age 18 dropped by about 27 per cent; the proportion married before age 15 declined by about 44 per cent. In sub-Saharan Africa  the proportions dropped 13 per cent and 24 per cent  respectively. Nevertheless  early marriage in these regions remains commonplace  with more than one in three women reportedly married before age 18. Indeed  the 10 countries with the highest rates of child marriage are found in these two regions.
