At least 200 million have been cut in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated and that have representative prevalence data. Rates of FGM overall have declined by more than 25 per cent over the last three decades. However  not all countries have made progress  and the pace of decline has been uneven. Today  in these 30 countries  more than one in three girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the procedure versus one in two in the mid-1980s.

    Different forms of violence  including physical  sexual  psychological and economic  as well as trafficking and other forms of sexual exploitation affect millions of women and girls worldwide. This not only constitutes a grave violation of human rights  but also hinders the process of development. Available comparable data from 52 countries (including only one country from the developed regions) indicate that 21 per cent of girls and women interviewed aged 15 to 49 years experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the previous 12 months.
