Gender equality and womens empowerment have advanced in recent decades. Progress in enrolment at all education levels has been observed  yet wide gender disparities exist in some regions and countries at higher education levels. Maternal mortality has declined and skilled care during delivery has increased. Progress has been made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Childbearing among adolescents has decreased. However  gender inequality persists worldwide  depriving women and girls of their basic rights and opportunities. Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will require more vigorous efforts  including legal frameworks  to counter deeply rooted gender-based discrimination that often results from patriarchal attitudes and related social norms.
