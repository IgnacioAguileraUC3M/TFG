Slightly more than half of all women (55 per cent) make their own decisions when it comes to sexual and reproductive health and rights  based on 20072018 data from 57 countries on women aged 15 to 49 who are either married or in union. The analysis also found that women have the most autonomy in deciding on the use of contraception (91 per cent). However  only three in four women are making their own decisions regarding health care or on whether or not to have sex.
Progress on other fronts is encouraging: in 2019  countries had established 73 per cent of the laws and regulations needed to guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights  according to data from 75 countries. The findings were particularly heartening when it comes to HIV. On average  countries had set in place 87 per cent of laws and regulations needed for HIV counselling and testing services; 91 per cent of those needed for HIV treatment and care services; and 96 per cent for HIV confidentiality. Meanwhile  countries had instituted 79 per cent of relevant laws and regulations that stipulate full  free and informed consent of individuals before they receive contraceptive services  including sterilization.
