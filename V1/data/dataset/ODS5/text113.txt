During the pandemic  women leaders have acted decisively and effectively to implement and manage response and recovery efforts  prioritizing measures that address the most vulnerable groups. Despite this widely acknowledged success  the pace of progress on womens representation in decision-making positions is discouraging. As of 1 January 2022  the global share of women in lower and single houses of national parliaments reached 26.2 per cent  up from 22.4 per cent in 2015. Womens share is slightly over one third in local governments. At this pace  it would take another 40 years for women and men to be represented equally in national parliaments.
Working women  including those in managerial positions  have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have had their hours reduced or left the workforce altogether due to increased unpaid care work at home. In 2019  before the pandemic  women accounted for 39.4 per cent of total employment. In 2020  women represented nearly 45 per cent of global employment losses. The share of women in managerial positions worldwide saw only slight improvement from 2015 to 2019  increasing from 27.2 to 28.3 per cent. That share remained unchanged from 2019 to 2020  which is the first year without an increase since 2013.
