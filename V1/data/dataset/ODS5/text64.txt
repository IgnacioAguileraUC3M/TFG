Women report that on average they spend 19 per cent of their time each day on unpaid labour versus 8 per cent for men. The responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work  combined with paid labour  mean that women and girls work longer hours than men and boys and have less time for rest  self-care  learning and other activities.
