 International commitments to advance gender equality have brought about improvements in some areas: child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) have declined in recent years  and womens representation in the political arena is higher than ever before. But the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality  and where all legal  social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed  remains unfulfilled. In fact  that goal is probably even more distant than before  since women and girls are being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis is creating circumstances that have already contributed to a surge in reports of violence against women and girls  and may increase child marriage and FGM. Moreover  women are likely to take on most additional care work owing to the closure of schools and day-care centres. They are also on the front lines in fighting the coronavirus  since women account for nearly 70 per cent of health and social workers globally.
