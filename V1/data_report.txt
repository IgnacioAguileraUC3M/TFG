 Reduce inequality within and among countries It is well documented that
income inequality is on the rise with the richest 10 percent earning up to
40 percent of total global income. The poorest 10 percent earn only
between 2 and 7 percent of total global income. In developing countries
inequality has increased by 11 percent if we take into account the growth
of population. These widening disparities are a call for action that
require the adoption of sound policies to empower the bottom percentile of
income earners and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of sex
race or ethnicity. Income inequality is a global problem that requires
global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of
financial markets and institutions encouraging development assistance and
foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest.
Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to
bridging the widening divide. Reducing inequalities is one of 17 Global
Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An
integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.

 Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for
all Between 1990 and 2010 the number of people with access to electricity
has increased by 1.7 billion and as the global population continues to
rise so will the demand for cheap energy. A global economy reliant on
fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions is creating
drastic changes to our climate system. This is having a visible impact on
every continent. However there has been a new drive to encourage
alternative energy sources and in 2011 renewable energy accounted for more
than 20 percent of global power generated. Still one in five people lack
access to electricity and as the demand continues to rise there needs to
be a substantial increase in the production of renewable energy across the
world. Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means
investing in clean energy sources such as solar wind and thermal. Adopting
cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also
reduce the global electricity consumption by buildings and industry by 14
percent. This means avoiding roughly 1300 mid-size power plants. Expanding
infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy sources in
all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth
and help the environment. Sustainable energy is one of 17 Global Goals
that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated
approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more
