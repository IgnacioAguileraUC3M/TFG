Promote just peaceful and inclusive societies Peace stability human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law are important conduits for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace security and prosperity while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed. High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a countryâ€™s development affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities that can last for generations. Sexual violence crime exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence and work with governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity. Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights is key to this process as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance. Promoting peace and justice is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
