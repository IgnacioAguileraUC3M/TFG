Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth employment and decent work for all Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically despite the long-lasting impact of the economic crisis of 2008/2009. In developing countries the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015. However as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth widening inequalities and employment that is not expanding fast enough to keep up with the growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization more than 204 million people are unemployed in 2015. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to encourage sustained economic growth by achieving higher levels of productivity and through technological innovation. Promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind the goal is to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030. Decent work is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
