Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts There is no country in the world that is not seeing first-hand the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and are now more than 50 percent higher than their 1990 level. Further global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not take action now. The annual average losses from just earthquakes tsunamis tropical cyclones and flooding count in the hundreds of billions of dollars requiring an investment of US$ 6 billion annually in disaster risk management alone. The goal aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries and help mitigate climate-related disasters. Strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of more vulnerable regions such as land locked countries and island states must go hand in hand with efforts to raise awareness and integrate measures into national policies and strategies. It is still possible with the political will and a wide array of technological measures to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This requires urgent collective action. Addressing climate change is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 13.
