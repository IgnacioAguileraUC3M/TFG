End poverty in all its forms everywhere Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half – from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015 – too many people are still struggling to meet the most basic human needs. Globally more than 800 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day; many lack access to adequate food clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid economic growth in countries like China and India has lifted millions out of poverty but progress has been uneven. Women are disproportionately affected; they are more likely to live in poverty due to unequal access to paid work education and property. Progress has also been limited in other regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa which account for 80 percent of the people living in extreme poverty. This rate is expected to rise due to new threats brought on by climate change conflict and food insecurity. TheSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a bold commitment to finish what we started and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. In order to achieve the SDGs we must target those living in vulnerable situations increasing access to basic resources and services and support communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. Ending poverty is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 1. ,1
 By 2030 eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day ,1
 By 2030 reduce at least by half the proportion of men women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions ,1

End hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity over the past two decades has seen the proportion of undernourished people drop by almost half. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of the most vulnerable. Central and East Asia Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger. These are all significant achievements in reaching the targets set out by the first Millennium Development Goals. Unfortunately extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. 795 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2014 often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation drought and loss of biodiversity. Over 90 million children under the age of five are dangerously underweight. And one person in every four still goes hungry in Africa. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030 making sure all people – especially children and the more vulnerable – have access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural practices: improving the livelihoods and capacities of small scale famers allowing equal access to land technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity. Together with the other goals set out here we can end hunger by 2030. Zero Hunger is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 2. ,2

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all Since the creation of the Millennium Development Goals there have been historic achievements in reducing child mortality improving maternal health and tackling HIV/AIDS tuberculosis malaria and other diseases. In 15 years the number of people newly infected by HIV each year has dropped from 3.1 million to 2 million and over 6.2 million lives were saved from malaria. Since 1990 maternal mortality fell by 45 percent and worldwide there has been an over 50 percent decline in preventable child deaths globally.  Despite this incredible progress AIDS is the leading cause of death among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa and 22 million people living with HIV are not accessing life-saving antiretroviral therapy. New HIV infections continue to rise in some locations and in populations that are typically excluded or marginalised. Chronic and catastrophic disease remains one of the main factors that push households from poverty into deprivation. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) impose a large burden on human health worldwide. Currently 63% of all deaths worldwide stem from NCDs – chiefly cardiovascular diseases cancers chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. The cumulative economic losses to low- and middle-income countries from the four diseases are estimated to surpass US$ 7 trillion by 2025. Additionally there continues to be underinvestment in the social circumstances and environmental factors affecting health. The job on HIV and health is far from done. Recognizing the interdependence of health and development theSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an ambitious comprehensiveplan of action for people planet and prosperity and for ending the injustices that underpin poor health and development outcomes. SDG 3 aspires to ensure health and well-being for all including a bold commitment to end the epidemics of AIDS tuberculosis malaria and othercommunicable diseases by 2030. It also aims to achieve universal health coverage and provide access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as well as expanding access to affordable medicines. Promoting health and well-being is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 3. ,3

 Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment development training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries especially in least developed countries and small island developing States ,3
 Strengthen the capacity of all countries in particular developing countries for early warning risk reduction and management of national and global health risks ,3
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Since 2000 there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015 and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable successes. Progress has also faced tough challenges in developing regions due to high levels of poverty armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North Africa ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the proportion of children out of school. This is a worrying trend. While sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment among all developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990 up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest households are four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high. Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training and to eliminate gender and wealth disparities with the aim of achieving universal access to a quality higher education. Quality education is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. ,4
 By 2030 ensure that all girls and boys complete free equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes ,4

 By 2030 substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries especially least developed countries and small island developing states ,4
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Empowering women and promoting gender equality is crucial to accelerating sustainable development. Ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right but it also has a multiplier effect across all other development areas. Since 2000 UNDP together with our UN partners and the rest of the global community has made gender equality central to our work and we have seen some remarkable successes. More girls are now in school compared to 15 years ago and most regions have reached gender parity in primary education. Women now make up to 41 percent of paid workers outside of agriculture compared to 35 percent in 1990. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to build on these achievements to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere. There are still gross inequalities in access to paid employment in some regions and significant gaps between men and women in the labour market. Sexual violence and exploitation the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work and discrimination in public decision making all remain huge barriers. Ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and affording women equal rights to economic resources such as land and property are vital targets to realizing this goal. There are now more women in public office than ever before but encouraging more women leaders across all regions will help strengthen policies and legislation for greater gender equality. Gender equality is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. ,5

Ensure access to water and sanitation for all Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a consequence of climate change. Although 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved water sanitation since 1990 dwindling supplies of safe drinking water is a major problem impacting every continent. In 2011 41 countries experienced water stress; ten of them are close to depleting their supply of renewable freshwater and must now rely on non-conventional sources. Increasing drought and desertification is already exacerbating these trends. By 2050 it is projected that at least one in four people are likely to be affected by recurring water shortages. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure provide sanitation facilities and encourage hygiene at every level. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems such as forests mountains wetlands and rivers is essential if we are to mitigate water scarcity. More international cooperation is also needed to encourage water efficiency and support treatment technologies in developing countries.  Universal access to clean water and sanitation is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 6. ,6
 By 2030 achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all ,6

Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all Between 1990 and 2010 the number of people with access to electricity has increased by 1.7 billion and as the global population continues to rise so will the demand for cheap energy. A global economy reliant on fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions is creating drastic changes to our climate system. This is having a visible impact on every continent. However there has been a new drive to encourage alternative energy sources and in 2011 renewable energy accounted for more than 20 percent of global power generated. Still one in five people lack access to electricity and as the demand continues to rise there needs to be a substantial increase in the production of renewable energy across the world. Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar wind and thermal. Adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also reduce the global electricity consumption by buildings and industry by 14 percent. This means avoiding roughly 1300 mid-size power plants. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy sources in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment. Sustainable energy is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 7. ,7
 By 2030 ensure universal access to affordable reliable and modern energy services ,7
 By 2030 increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix ,7
 By 2030 double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency ,7

 By 2030 expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries in particular least developed countries small island developing States and land-locked developing countries in accordance with their respective programmes of support ,7
Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth employment and decent work for all Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically despite the long-lasting impact of the economic crisis of 2008/2009. In developing countries the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015. However as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth widening inequalities and employment that is not expanding fast enough to keep up with the growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization more than 204 million people are unemployed in 2015. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to encourage sustained economic growth by achieving higher levels of productivity and through technological innovation. Promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind the goal is to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030. Decent work is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 8. ,8

Build resilient infrastructure promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Sustained investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies. Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries and investing in scientific research and innovation are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge and as a consequence foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Investment in infrastructure and innovation is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 9. ,9

 Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020 ,9
Reduce inequality within and among countries It is well documented that income inequality is on the rise with the richest 10 percent earning up to 40 percent of total global income. The poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 and 7 percent of total global income. In developing countries inequality has increased by 11 percent if we take into account the growth of population. These widening disparities are a call for action that require the adoption of sound policies to empower the bottom percentile of income earners and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of sex race or ethnicity. Income inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide. Reducing inequalities is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 10. ,10
 By 2030 progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average ,10

 By 2030 reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent ,10
Make cities inclusive safe resilient and sustainable More than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas. By 2050 that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people – two-thirds of humanity. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. The rapid growth of cities in the developing world coupled with increasing rural to urban migration has led to a boom in mega-cities. In 1990 there were ten mega-cities with 10 million inhabitants or more. In 2014 there are 28 mega-cities home to a total 453 million people. Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas. Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing and upgrading slum settlements. It also involves investment in public transport creating green public spaces and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive. Sustainable city life is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 11. ,11
 By 2030 ensure access for all to adequate safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums ,11

 Support least developed countries including through financial and technical assistance in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials ,11
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater appropriated for human use. The efficient management of our shared natural resources and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030. A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving per capita global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy. Responsible production and consumption is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 12. ,12
 Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production all countries taking action with developed countries taking the lead taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries ,12
 By 2030 achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources ,12

Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts There is no country in the world that is not seeing first-hand the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and are now more than 50 percent higher than their 1990 level. Further global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not take action now. The annual average losses from just earthquakes tsunamis tropical cyclones and flooding count in the hundreds of billions of dollars requiring an investment of US$ 6 billion annually in disaster risk management alone. The goal aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries and help mitigate climate-related disasters. Strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of more vulnerable regions such as land locked countries and island states must go hand in hand with efforts to raise awareness and integrate measures into national policies and strategies. It is still possible with the political will and a wide array of technological measures to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This requires urgent collective action. Addressing climate change is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 13. ,13

Conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources The world’s oceans – their temperature chemistry currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole and to counter balance the effects of climate change. Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However today we are seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited well below a level at which they can produce sustainable yields. Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources is reaching alarming levels with an average of 13000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometer of ocean. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create a framework to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from land-based pollution as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans. Protecting our oceans is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals. Learn more about the targets for Goal 14. ,14

Sustainably manage forests combat desertification halt and reverse land degradation halt biodiversity loss Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihood. Plant life provides 80 percent of our human diet and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earth’s surface providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as well as being crucial for combating climate change. Today we are seeing unprecedented land degradation and the loss of arable land at 30 to 35 times the historical rate. Drought and desertification is also on the rise each year amounting to the loss of 12 million hectares and affects poor communities globally. Of the 8300 animal breeds known 8 percent are extinct and 22 percent are at risk of extinction. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests wetlands drylands and mountains by 2020. Promoting the sustainable management of forests and halting deforestations is also vital to mitigating the impact of climate change. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage. Conserving forests and other ecosystems is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.

Promote just peaceful and inclusive societies Peace stability human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law are important conduits for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace security and prosperity while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed. High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities that can last for generations. Sexual violence crime exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence and work with governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity. Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights is key to this process as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance. Promoting peace and justice is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.

Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and cooperation. While official development assistance from developed countries increased by 66 percent between 2000 and 2014 humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to demand financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade. The world today is more interconnected than ever before. Improving access to technology and knowledge is an important way to share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing countries manage their debt as well as promoting investment for the least developed is vital to achieve sustainable growth and development. The goals aim to enhance North-South and South-South cooperation by supporting national plans to achieve all the targets. Promoting international trade and helping developing countries increase their exports is all part of achieving a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open and benefits all. Strengthening global solidarity is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
