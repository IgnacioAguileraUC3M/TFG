"The 2030 Agenda acknowledges that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions including extreme poverty is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
The first Sustainable Development Goal aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. Its seven associated targets aims among others to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere reduce at least by half the proportion of men women and children of all ages living in poverty and implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all including floors and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable
As recalled by the foreword of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals Report at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 189 countries unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration pledging to “spare no effort to free our fellow men women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty”. This commitment was translated into an inspiring framework of eight goals and then into wide-ranging practical steps that have enabled people across the world to improve their lives and their future prospects. The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty to make inroads against hunger to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet.
Nevertheless in spite of all the remarkable gains inequalities have persisted and progress has been uneven. Therefore the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its set of Sustainable Development Goals have been committed as stated in the Declaration of the Agenda “to build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished business”.
The theme of the 2017 High-Level Political Forum was Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing worl” and it included SDG 1 as one of the focus SDGs
From Agenda 21 to Future We Want
In The Future We Want the outcome document of Rio+20 Member States emphasized the need to accord the highest priority to poverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda addressing the root causes and challenges of poverty through integrated coordinated and coherent strategies at all level.
In the context of the multi-year programme of work adopted by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) after the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) poverty eradication appears as an overriding issue on the agenda of the CSD each year.
Poverty eradication is addressed in Chapter II of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (2002) which stressed that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development particularly for developing countries.
Priority actions on poverty eradication include:
improving access to sustainable livelihoods entrepreneurial opportunities and productive resources;
providing universal access to basic social services;
progressively developing social protection systems to support those who cannot support themselves;
empowering people living in poverty and their organizations;
addressing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women;
working with interested donors and recipients to allocate increased shares of ODA to poverty eradication; and
intensifying international cooperation for poverty eradication.

The General Assembly in its 1997 Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 (paragraph 27) decided that poverty eradication should be an overriding theme of sustainable development for the coming years. It is one of the fundamental goals of the international community and of the entire United Nations system.
Combating poverty is the topic of Chapter 3 of Agenda 21. It is also in commitment 2 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development.
Agenda 21 emphasized that poverty is a complex multidimensional problem with origins in both the national and international domains. No uniform solution can be found for global application. Rather country-specific programmes to tackle poverty and international efforts supporting national efforts as well as the parallel process of creating a supportive international environment are crucial for a solution to this problem.
The years following the 1992 Rio Conference have witnessed an increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty particularly in developing countries. The enormity and complexity of the poverty issue could endanger the social fabric undermine economic development and the environment and threaten political stability in many countries.

"As the United Nations Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki – Moon noted in the Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 “disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced” and big gaps persist in different sectors:
It is estimated that in 2015 still roughly 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to modern energy services and more than 1 billion do not have access to electricity. For the most part this grave development burden falls on rural areas where a lack of access to modern energy services negatively affects productivity educational attainment and even health and ultimately exacerbates the poverty trap.
In rural areas only 56 per cent of births are attended by skilled health personnel compared with 87 per cent in urban areas.
About 16 per cent of the rural population do not use improved drinking water sources compared to 4 per cent of the urban population.
About 50 per cent of people living in rural areas lack improved sanitation facilities compared to only 18 per cent of people in urban areas.
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of the Post-2015 Development Agenda calls to “end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”. In particular target 2.a devotes a specific attention to “Increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation in rural infrastructure agricultural research and extension services technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries in particular least developed countries.
Background information
Promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development (SARD) is the subject of chapter 14 of Agenda 21.
The major objective of SARD is to increase food production in a sustainable way and enhance food security. This will involve education initiatives utilization of economic incentives and the development of appropriate and new technologies thus ensuring stable supplies of nutritionally adequate food access to those supplies by vulnerable groups and production for markets; employment and income generation to alleviate poverty; and natural resource management and environmental protection.
The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) first reviewed Rural Development at its third session in 1995 when it noted with concern that even though some progress had been reported disappointment is widely expressed at the slow progress in moving towards sustainable agriculture and rural development in many countries.
Sustainable agriculture was also considered at the five-year review of implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 at which time Governments were urged to attach high priority to implementing the commitments agreed at the World Food Summit especially the call for at least halving the number of undernourished people in the world by the year 2015. This goal was reinforced by the Millennium Declaration adopted by Heads of State and Government in September 2000 which resolved to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world's people who suffer from hunger.
In accordance with its multi-year programme of work agriculture with a rural development perspective was a major focus of CSD-8 in 2000 along with integrated planning and management of land resources as the sectoral theme. The supporting documentation and the discussions highlighted the linkages between the economic social and environmental objectives of sustainable agriculture. The Commission adopted decision 8/4 which identified 12 priorities for action. It reaffirmed that the major objectives of SARD are to increase food production and enhance food security in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management. It noted that food security-although a policy priority for all countries-remains an unfulfilled goal. It also noted that agriculture has a special and important place in society and helps to sustain rural life and land.
Rural Development was included as one of the thematic areas along with Agriculture Land Drought Desertification and Africa in the third implementation cycle CSD-16/CSD-17.
A growing emphasis is being placed on the Nexus approach to sustainable rural development seeking to realize synergies from the links between development factors such as energy health education water food gender and economic growth.
In this regard and as part of the follow up to the 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio+20 the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) in collaboration with SE4All UN-Energy and the  Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) organized Global Conference on Rural Energy Access: A Nexus Approach to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication in Addis Ababa Ethiopia Dec 4 – 6 2013.

"The Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA) adopted in 1994 further complemented by The Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) of 2005 and MSI+5 Outcome document recognized that although they are afflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by development imperatives similar to those of developing countries generally small island developing States (SIDS) have their own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics. SIDS’ unique and particular vulnerabilities are highlighted in “The Future We Want” adopted at The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20) that took place in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in June 2012 - their small size remoteness narrow resource and export base and exposure to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks including to a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters (para 178). SIDS continue to address those structural and external challenges to achieve their sustainable development.
The Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia Samoa in September 2014 with the overarching theme of “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships”. Nearly 300 partnerships were announced at the conference and monitored through the Partnership Platform. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) adopted at the Conference addresses priority areas for SIDS and calls for urgent actions and support for SIDS’ efforts to achieve their sustainable development.
UN-DESA  leads inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system through the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs Plus (ECESA Plus) and among UN and non-UN entities active on SIDS issues through the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) on SIDS to monitor the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway as well as the progress being made in the SIDS partnerships. Moreover UN-DESA and particularly the SIDS Unit provides technical assistance and advice supports intergovernmental processes and reports on progress made in the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway.

"As the world population continues to grow much more effort and innovation will be urgently needed in order to sustainably increase agricultural production improve the global supply chain decrease food losses and waste and ensure that all who are suffering from hunger and malnutrition have access to nutritious food. Many in the international community believe that it is possible to eradicate hunger within the next generation and are working together to achieve this goal.
World leaders at the 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) reaffirmed the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger. The UN Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger Challenge launched at Rio+20 called on governments civil society faith communities the private sector and research institutions to unite to end hunger and eliminate the worst forms of malnutrition.
The Zero Hunger Challenge has since garnered widespread support from many member States and other entities. It calls for:
Zero stunted children under the age of two
100% access to adequate food all year round
All food systems are sustainable
100% increase in smallholder productivity and income
Zero loss or waste of food
The Sustainable Development Goal to “End hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” (SDG2) recognizes the inter linkages among supporting sustainable agriculture empowering small farmers promoting gender equality ending rural poverty ensuring healthy lifestyles tackling climate change and other issues addressed within the set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the Post-2015 Development Agenda.
Beyond adequate calories intake proper nutrition has other dimensions that deserve attention including micronutrient availability and healthy diets. Inadequate micronutrient intake of mothers and infants can have long-term developmental impacts. Unhealthy diets and lifestyles are closely linked to the growing incidence of non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries.
Adequate nutrition during the critical 1000 days from beginning of pregnancy through a child’s second birthday merits a particular focus. The Scaling-Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement has made great progress since its creation five years ago in incorporating strategies that link nutrition to agriculture clean water sanitation education employment social protection health care and support for resilience.
Extreme poverty and hunger are predominantly rural with smallholder farmers and their families making up a very significant proportion of the poor and hungry. Thus eradicating poverty and hunger are integrally linked to boosting food production agricultural productivity and rural incomes.
Agriculture systems worldwide must become more productive and less wasteful. Sustainable agricultural practices and food systems including both production and consumption must be pursued from a holistic and integrated perspective.
Land healthy soils water and plant genetic resources are key inputs into food production and their growing scarcity in many parts of the world makes it imperative to use and manage them sustainably. Boosting yields on existing agricultural lands including restoration of degraded lands through sustainable agricultural practices would also relieve pressure to clear forests for agricultural production. Wise management of scarce water through improved irrigation and storage technologies combined with development of new drought-resistant crop varieties can contribute to sustaining drylands productivity.
Halting and reversing land degradation will also be critical to meeting future food needs. The Rio+20 outcome document calls for achieving a land-degradation-neutral world in the context of sustainable development. Given the current extent of land degradation globally the potential benefits from land restoration for food security and for mitigating climate change are enormous. However there is also recognition that scientific understanding of the drivers of desertification land degradation and drought is still evolving.
There are many elements of traditional farmer knowledge that enriched by the latest scientific knowledge can support productive food systems through sound and sustainable soil land water nutrient and pest management and the more extensive use of organic fertilizers.
An increase in integrated decision-making processes at national and regional levels are needed to achieve synergies and adequately address trade-offs among agriculture water energy land and climate change.
Given expected changes in temperatures precipitation and pests associated with climate change the global community is called upon to increase investment in research development and demonstration of technologies to improve the sustainability of food systems everywhere. Building resilience of local food systems will be critical to averting large-scale future shortages and to ensuring food security and good nutrition for all.",ODS2
"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states that the Sustainable Development Gaols (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic social and environmental). The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. Accordingly the integrated and interlinked nature of the SDGs needs to inform and guide their mainstreaming into national planning frameworks in the form of national development plans or sustainable development strategies. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda depends on such an integrated approach which involves identifying possible synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their associated targets as well as developing context specific integrated approaches to ensure effective implementation.
The 2019 SDG Summit called on countries to “mainstream the 2030 Agenda into our national planning instruments policies strategies and financial frameworks”. The voluntary national reviews (VNRs) and other sources provide examples of approaches taken by countries to integrate the 2030 agenda into national plans and strategies. Countries are also integrating regional and continental agendas into their plans for instance the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. The SDGs are also being incorporated into plans and review processes at the sub-national as evidenced by the voluntary local reviews.
The integration of the SDGs – and sustainable development more broadly – builds on the experience with National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) which were included in 1992 in Agenda 21 (§ 8.7). Here countries were called upon to integrate economic social and environmental objectives into one strategically focused blueprint for action at the national level. The NSDS “should be developed through the widest possible participation”. And it “should be based on a thorough assessment of the current situation and initiatives”.
As seen at the Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development issues such as country ownership and strong political commitment the integration of economic social and environmental objectives across sectors territories and generations; broad participation and effective partnerships the development of capacity and enabling environment as well as the mobilization of means of implementations remain at the centre of policy debates at all levels.
More on NSDS
In the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly (23-28 June 1997) member States reaffirmed the importance of NSDS and set a target of 2002 for the formulation and elaboration of NSDS that reflect the contributions and responsibilities of all interested parties.
However by 2002 based on national reports received from governments only about 85 countries had developed some form of national strategies and the nature and effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably from country to country. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) through paragraph 162 b recommitted member States to “take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development and to begin their implementation by 2005.”
During the preparatory process for the 2002 WSSD the International Forum on NSDS was held in Accra Ghana in 2001 which led to the launch of the Guidance in Preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy. It defined National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) as “a coordinated participatory and iterative process of thoughts and actions to achieve economic environmental and social objectives in a balanced and integrative manner”. Most importantly NSDS is a call for an institutional change. It aims at a transition from the traditional static putting-a-plan-on-paper exercise towards the establishment of an adaptive system that can continuously improve. It should be a process which “encompasses situation analysis formulation of policies and action plans implementation monitoring and regular review. It is a cyclical and interactive process of planning participation and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a ‘plan’ as an end product.”
Every country needs to determine for itself how best to approach the preparation and implementation of its national sustainable development strategy depending upon the prevailing political historical cultural ecological circumstances. A blueprint approach for national sustainable development strategies is neither possible nor desirable. The particular label applied to a national sustainable development strategy is not important as long as the underlying principles characterizing a national sustainable development strategy are adhered to and that economic social and environmental objectives are balanced and integrated.
Today there is an increased interest in national development planning and for many countries their national plan or strategy - even if not labelled as an NSDS - is the chief means for incorporating the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs into the national policy framework.

"Sustainable Development Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to “ensure healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages”. TThe associated targets aim to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio; end preventable deaths of newborns and children; end the epidemics of AIDS tuberculosis malaria and other communicable diseases; reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases; strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse; halve the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents; ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services; achieve universal health coverage; and reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and pollution.

The MDG era and before
As part of the efforts to achieve the maternal and child health MDGs the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Every Woman Every Child initiative at the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Summit in September 2010. Every Woman Every Child is an unprecedented global movement that mobilizes and intensifies international and national action by governments multilaterals the private sector and civil society to address the major health challenges facing women and children around the world. The movement puts into action the Global Strategy for Women and Children’s Health which presents a roadmap on how to enhance financing strengthen policy and improve service on the ground for the most vulnerable women and children.
The Commission on Sustainable Development considered Health and sustainable development as a cross-cutting issue during the two-year cycle of its multi-year programme of work. Health and Sustainable Development was also an integral part of the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. The outcome document of the Summit the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation devotes Chapter 6 to Health and Sustainable Development recalling that human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature and further recognizes that the goals of sustainable development can only be achieved in the absence of a high prevalence of debilitating diseases while obtaining health gains for the whole population requires poverty eradication.
The outcome of the United Nations on Environment and Development Agenda 21 devotes Chapter 6 to “Protecting and Promoting Human Health”. The Agenda recognizes that health and development are intimately interconnected and call that action items under Agenda 21 must address the primary health needs of the world's population since they are integral to the achievement of the goals of sustainable development and primary environmental care",ODS3
"

Education for all has always been an integral part of the sustainable development agenda. The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 adopted the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) which in its Section X reaffirmed both the Millennium Development Goal 2 in achieving universal primary education by 2015 and the goal of the Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005 and at all levels of education by 2015. The JPOI addressed the need to integrate sustainable development into formal education at all levels as well as through informal and non-formal education opportunities.
There is growing international recognition of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as an integral element of quality education and a key enabler for sustainable development. Both the Muscat Agreement adopted at the Global Education For All Meeting (GEM) in 2014 and the proposal for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed by the Open Working Group of the UN General Assembly on SDGs (OWG) include ESD in the proposed targets for the post- 2015 agenda. The proposed Sustainable Development Goal 4 reads Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all and includes a set of associated targets.
ESD is closely tied into the international discussions on sustainable development which have grown in scale and importance since Our Common Future appeared in 1987 providing the first widely-used definition of sustainable development as the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
The crucial role of education in achieving sustainable development was also duly noted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 through Chapter 36 of its outcome document - Agenda 21.
The importance of promoting education for sustainable development and integrating sustainable development actively into education was also emphasized in paragraph 233 of the Future We Want the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20 in 2012.
In 2005 UNESCO launched the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development which reaffirmed the key role of education in shaping values that are supportive of sustainable development and in consolidating sustainable societies. The final report of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development Shaping the Future We Want was launched at the UNESCO World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development held in November 2014 Nagoya Japan.
In the run-up to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20 the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI) was created as a partnership of several sponsor UN entities (UNESCO UN-DESA UNEP Global Compact and UNU) aiming at galvanizing commitments from higher education institutions to teach and encourage research on sustainable development greening campuses and support local sustainability efforts. With a membership of almost 300 universities worldwide HESI accounts for more than one-third of all the voluntary commitments that came out of the Rio +20 Conference providing higher education institutions with a unique interface between policy making and academia.

"Since its creation 70 years ago the UN has achieved important results in advancing gender equality from the establishment of the Commission on the Status of Women - the main global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women - through the adoption of various landmark agreements such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
On the occasion of the General Debate of the 66th Session of the General Assembly held in September 2011 United Nations Secretary-General BAN KI-MOON highlighted in his Report “We the Peoples” the crucial role of gender equality as driver of development progress recognizing that the potential of women had not been fully realized owing to inter alia persistent social economic and political inequalities.
Gender inequalities are still deep-rooted in every society. Women suffer from lack of access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender wage gaps. In many situations they are denied access to basic education and health care and are victims of violence and discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic decision-making processes.
With the aim of better addressing these challenges and to identify a single recognized driver to lead and coordinate UN activities on gender equality issues UN Women was established in 2010.
UN Women works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls empowerment of women and achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development human rights humanitarian action and peace and security.
The vital role of women and the need for their full and equal participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development was reaffirmed in the Future We Want (paragraph 236-244) as well as in the Open Working Group Proposal for Sustainable Development Goals.

"Water and sanitation are at the core of sustainable development and the range of services they provide underpin poverty reduction economic growth and environmental sustainability. However inrecentdecades overexploitation pollution and climate change haveledto severe water stressin locales acrossthe world.
Today2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking waterand more than4.2 billion people lack safely managed sanitation.Climate change is exacerbating the situation with increasing disasters such as floods and droughts. 80 per cent of wastewater in the world flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused and 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland extent has been lost including a significant loss of freshwater species.
The COVID-19 pandemicposesan additional impediment impairing access forbillions of people to safely managed drinking water sanitation and hygiene services–services desperately needed to prevent the virus from spreading.
Now more than ever the world needs to transform the way it manages its water resources and delivers water and sanitation services for billions of people.Urgent action isneeded to overcome this global crisis as it is affecting all countries around the world socially economically and environmentally.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) on water and sanitation adoptedby United Nations Member Statesat the 2015 UN Summit as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides the blueprint forensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
As a direct response to the Decade ofActionandDeliveryforSustainableDevelopmentcalled for by Heads of State and Government at the SDG Summit in 2019 the UN system launched the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework in July 2020 to step up progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and put the world on track to realize their targets by 2030.We call upon all stakeholders to galvanize actions around theframeworkin order to accelerate achievement ofthewater-related goals and targetsandovercome the global crisis.

Background
While SDG 6 is the most recentiterationof the United Nations’aimto address water-related issuesthe topichas long been aconcernat the United Nations.
In1977theMar del Plata conference in Argentina created an Action Plan on “Community Water Supply” declaring that all peoples have the right to access to drinking water in quantities and quality equal to their basic needs. The importance of water was further raised by the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade from 1981 to 1990 and in 1992 at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (Agenda 21 Chapter 18) as well as at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE) in Dublin.
In 1993 the World Water Day was designated on 22 March by the UN General Assembly and in 2013 World Toilet Day on 19 November.
In 2000 the Millennium Development Declaration called for the world to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water as well as the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation and in 2003 the International Year of Freshwater was declared by the General Assembly followed by the “Water for Life Decade from 2005 to 2015.
In order to coordinate the efforts of UN entities and international organizations working on water and sanitation issues the Chief Executives Board (CEB) of the United Nations established in 2003 UN-Water — a UN inter-agency coordination mechanism for all freshwater and sanitation related issues.
In 2008 the International Year of Sanitation was declared and on 28 July 2010 the human right to water and sanitation was explicitly recognized by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 64/292.
In December 2016 the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the resolution “International Decade for Action – Water for Sustainable Development” (2018–2028) in support of the achievement of SDG 6 and other water-related targetsand on 21 December 2020 theresolution onthe“United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development” 2018–2028”  thefirst UN Conference on watersince 1977.Water is also at the heart of milestone agreements such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all has therefore been for a long time a topic at the United Nations and the priority is now turning the new vision of water related SDGs of the 2030 Agenda into reality through national leadership and global partnership.

"SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy
In 2015 the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which include a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy SDG 7 calling to ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all. Energy lies at the heart of both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Ensuring access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all will open a new world of opportunities for millions of people through new economic opportunities and jobs empowered women children and youth better education and health more sustainable equitable and inclusive communities and greater protections from and resilience to climate change.
The Global Roadmap for Accelerated SDG 7 Action resulting from the High-level Dialogue on Energy 2021 provides a guide for collective action on energy across sectors that transcends individual and piecemeal approaches and delivers scaled-up and broad impact. It calls for action in five key areas: closing the energy access gap; rapidly transitioning to decarbonized energy systems; mobilizing adequate and predictable finance; leaving no one behind on the path to a net-zero future; and harnessing innovation technology and data. Importantly the Roadmap also includes two sets of milestones for 2025 and 2030.
Progress Towards SDG 7
While much progress has been made since 2015 the world is clearly not on track for the achievement of SDG 7: globally 733 million people were still lacking access to electricity and 2.4 billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels and technology in 2020. In terms of renewable energy globally there were already close to three terawatts of renewable energy capacity in 2020 representing nearly 29% of all power generation and renewables accounted for 82% of newly installed capacity that year. However fossil fuels still made up about 60% of global power generation capacity. In addition the current average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement must increase from the current 0.8% to 3.0%.
The Secretary-General’s Sustainable Development Goals Report provides an overview of overall progress on the SDGs while Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report assesses annually the progress made and provides a snapshot of how far we are from achieving SDG 7 specifically. Moreover the annual SDG7 Policy Briefs provide a focus on energy’s interlinkages with other SDGs.
The Role of the United Nations
UN-Energy
While there is no single entity in the United Nations system that has sole responsibility for energy many of its agencies bodies and programmes work extensively towards the achievement of SDG 7. Building on these efforts UN-Energy is the United Nations’ mechanism for inter-agency collaboration in the field of energy. UN-Energy brings together some 30 organizations that are global leaders in their respective fields covering together all aspects of energy and sustainable development. UN-Energy is co-chaired by Mr. Achim Steiner Administrator of UNDP and Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sustainable Energy for All. DESA serves as the Secretariat of UN-Energy.
UN-Energy seeks to support countries in achieving SDG7 and the interrelated goals of the Paris Climate Agenda and the broader SDG agenda. In May 2022 the UN-Energy Plan of Action Towards 2025 was launched to guide activities in the upcoming years providing clarity focus and expected deliverables that will enable UN-Energy to catalyse the implementation of the Global Roadmap for Accelerated SDG 7 Action in support of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. As part of this UN-Energy launched the Energy Compact Action Network which provides a platform for the proponents of Energy Compacts in support of implementing their voluntary commitments of over $600 billion USD into SDG 7 and to mobilize further commitments.
DESA’s work on SDG 7
DESA supports Member States with secretariat services for their intergovernmental discussions on energy. This includes support to the General Assembly in particular the Second Committee the review of SDG 7 at the High-level Political Forum and General Assembly mandated events such as the High-level Dialogue on Energy 2021 and the Global Stocktaking on SDG 7 Implementation to be held in 2024.
DESA also facilitates the provision of analysis on energy issues in support of the achievement of SDG 7. To this end DESA convenes the SDG7 Technical Advisory Group which brings together multi-stakeholder experts from a broad range of institutions and all world regions to facilitate stocktaking of progress to-date and to provide technical advice. The Group is essential to the annual publication of the SDG7 Policy Briefs in support of the High-level Political Forum.
Moreover DESA is actively engaged in capacity building on SDG 7 including through the Sustainable Water and Energy Solutions Network. The goal of this multi-stakeholder Network is to provide a global platform for all stakeholders to enhance capacities and signal their high-level commitment on water-energy approaches and solutions. It supports the sharing of best practices experiences and quality data the strengthening of capacity building the mobilization and scaling up multi-stakeholder action and the enhancement of advocacy communications and outreach.",ODS7
"The Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA) adopted in 1994 further complemented by The Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) of 2005 and MSI+5 Outcome document recognized that although they are afflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by development imperatives similar to those of developing countries generally small island developing States (SIDS) have their own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics. SIDS’ unique and particular vulnerabilities are highlighted in “The Future We Want” adopted at The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20) that took place in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in June 2012 - their small size remoteness narrow resource and export base and exposure to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks including to a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters (para 178). SIDS continue to address those structural and external challenges to achieve their sustainable development.
The Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia Samoa in September 2014 with the overarching theme of “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships”. Nearly 300 partnerships were announced at the conference and monitored through the Partnership Platform. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) adopted at the Conference addresses priority areas for SIDS and calls for urgent actions and support for SIDS’ efforts to achieve their sustainable development.
UN-DESA  leads inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system through the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs Plus (ECESA Plus) and among UN and non-UN entities active on SIDS issues through the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) on SIDS to monitor the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway as well as the progress being made in the SIDS partnerships. Moreover UN-DESA and particularly the SIDS Unit provides technical assistance and advice supports intergovernmental processes and reports on progress made in the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway.

"Sustainable development has been the overarching goal of the international community since the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. Amongst numerous commitments the Conference called upon governments to develop national strategies for sustainable development incorporating policy measures outlined in the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21. Despite the efforts of many governments around the world to implement such strategies as well as international cooperation to support national governments there are continuing concerns over global economic and environmental developments in many countries. These have been intensified by recent prolonged global energy food and financial crises and underscored by continued warnings from global scientists that society is transgressing a number of planetary boundaries or ecological limits.
With governments today seeking effective ways to lead their nations out of these related crises whilst also taking into account these planetary boundaries green economy (in its various forms) has been proposed as a means for catalysing renewed national policy development and international cooperation and support for sustainable development. The concept has received significant international attention over the past few years as a tool to address the 2008 financial crisis as well as one of two themes for the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). This has resulted in a rapidly expanding literature including new publications on green economy from a variety of influential international organisations national governments think tanks experts non-government organisations and others.
Governments agreed at Rio+20 to frame the green economy as an important tool for sustainable development; one that is inclusive and can drive economic growth employment and poverty eradication whilst maintaining the healthy functioning of the Earth’s ecosystems. Importantly the outcome document also recognises that capacity building information exchange and experience sharing will be critical for implementing green economy policies.
Recent initiatives on green economy or green growth by the  United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) the International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World Bank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP) the Green Economy Coalition https://www.greeneconomycoalition.org Stakeholder Forum the Green Growth Leaders and many others have begun to address these knowledge gaps and demystify these concepts.
Importantly there is also emerging practice in the design and implementation of national green economy strategies by both developed and developing countries across most regions including Africa Latin America the Asia-Pacific and Europe. This emerging practice can help to provide some important insights and much-needed clarity regarding the types of green economy policy measures their scope with regard to various sectors and national priorities and their institutional barriers risks and implementation costs. This international experience (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1501) may serve to alleviate concerns regarding the effective integration of green economy policies with national economic and social priorities and objectives that a transition to a greener and more inclusive economy offers for advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals SDGs.",ODS8
"The key role of decent work for all in achieving sustainable development is highlighted by Sustainable Development Goal 8 which aims to “promote sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth full and productive employment and decent work for all”.
Decent work employment creation social protection rights at work and social dialogue represent integral elements of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Furthermore crucial aspects of decent work are broadly rooted in the targets of many of the other 16 goals.
In its Paragraphs 143-157 the outcome document of the Rio +20 Conference expresses its concerns about labour market conditions and the widespread deficits of available decent work opportunities. At the same time recognizes the existing linkages among poverty eradication full and productive employment and decent work for all and urges all governments to address the global challenge of youth employment.
The global challenge of youth employment is also recalled by the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development adopted in Johannesburg in 2002.
Among the concerted and concrete measuring required for enabling developing countries to achieve their sustainable development goals JPOI highlights the importance of providing assistance to increase income-generating employment opportunities taking into account the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization.
JPOI reads “Good governance is essential for sustainable development. Sound economic policies solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth poverty eradication and employment creation. Freedom peace and security domestic stability respect for human rights including the right to development and the rule of law gender equality market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing.
Chapter 3 of Agenda 21 identifies the need to strengthening employment and income- generating programmes as tool to eradicate poverty. The Agenda also invites governments to establish measures able to directly or indirectly generate remunerative employment and productive occupational opportunities compatible with country-specific factor endowments on a scale sufficient to take care of prospective increases in the labour force and to cover backlogs.
Furthermore the Agenda reiterates in different sections the need of generating employment for vulnerable groups specifically women urban poor unemployed rural labour as well as low-income urban residents.",ODS8
"Tourism is one of the world's fastest growing industries and an important source of foreign exchange and employment while being closely linked to the social economic and environmental well-being of many countries especially developing countries. Maritime or ocean-related tourism as well as coastal tourism are for example vital sectors of the economy in small island developing States (SIDS) and coastal least developed countries (LDCs) (see also: The Potential of the Blue Economy report as well as the Community of Ocean Action on sustainable blue economy).
The World Tourism Organization defines sustainable tourism as “tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic social and environmental impacts addressing the needs of visitors the industry the environment and host communities.
Based on General assembly resolution 70/193 2017 was declared as theInternational Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development.
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development SDG target 8.9 aims to “by 2030 devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products”. The importance of sustainable tourism is also highlighted in SDG target 12.b. which aims to “develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products”.
Tourism is also identified as one of the tools to “by 2030 increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries” as comprised in SDG target 14.7.
In the Rio+20 outcome document The Future We want sustainable tourism is defined by paragraph 130 as a significant contributor “to the three dimensions of sustainable development” thanks to its close linkages to other sectors and its ability to create decent jobs and generate trade opportunities. Therefore Member States recognize “the need to support sustainable tourism activities and relevant capacity-building that promote environmental awareness conserve and protect the environment respect wildlife flora biodiversity ecosystems and cultural diversity and improve the welfare and livelihoods of local communities by supporting their local economies and the human and natural environment as a whole. ” In paragraph 130 Member States also “call for enhanced support for sustainable tourism activities and relevant capacity-building in developing countries in order to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development”.
In paragraph 131 Member States “encourage the promotion of investment in sustainable tourism including eco-tourism and cultural tourism which may include creating small- and medium-sized enterprises and facilitating access to finance including through microcredit initiatives for the poor indigenous peoples and local communities in areas with high eco-tourism potential”. In this regard Member States also “underline the importance of establishing where necessary appropriate guidelines and regulations in accordance with national priorities and legislation for promoting and supporting sustainable tourism”.
In 2002 the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg called for the promotion of sustainable tourism development including non-consumptive and eco-tourism in Chapter IV paragraph 43 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
At the Johannesburg Summit the launch of the “Sustainable Tourism – Eliminating Poverty (ST-EP) initiative was announced. The initiative was inaugurated by the World Tourism Organization in collaboration with UNCTAD in order to develop sustainable tourism as a force for poverty alleviation.
The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) last reviewed the issue of sustainable tourism in 2001 when it was acting as the Preparatory Committee for the Johannesburg Summit.
The importance of sustainable tourism was also mentioned in Agenda 21.

"Inclusive and sustainable industrial development has been incorporated together with resilient infrastructure and innovation as Sustainable Development Goal 9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Both the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda focus on the relevance of inclusive and sustainable industrial development as the basis for sustainable economic growth.
In its Paragraph 11 the Addis Ababa Action Agenda commits to “identify actions and address critical gaps relevant” to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals “with an aim to harness their considerable synergies so that the implementation of one will contribute to the progress of others”. The Agenda has therefore identified a range of cross –cutting areas that build on these synergies.
Among these cross-cutting areas paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda respectively focus on “promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization” and on “generating full and productive employment and decent work for all and promoting micro small and medium-size enterprises.
Prior to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda the relevance of inclusive and sustainable industrial development as the basis for sustainable economic growth was also addressed by the Lima Declaration: Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development adopted in December 2013.
Paragraph 2 of the Lima Declaration reads: “industrialization is a driver of development. Industry increases productivity job creation and generates income thereby contributing to poverty eradication and addressing other development goals as well as providing opportunities for social inclusion including gender equality empowering women and girls and creating decent employment for the youth. As industry develops it drives an increase of value addition and enhances the application of science technology and innovation therefore encouraging greater investment in skills and education and thus providing the resources to meet broader inclusive and sustainable development objectives.”
The mutually reinforcing relationship between social and industrial development and the potential of industrialization to promote directly and indirectly a variety of social objectives such as employment creation poverty eradication gender equality labour standards and greater access to education and health care was also identified in Chapter II of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development provide the fundamental framework for policy discussion and action on matters related to industry and sustainable development. Although the role of business and industry as a major group is specifically addressed in chapter 30 issues related to industry and economic development consumption and production patterns social development and environmental protection cut across the entirety of Agenda 21 including its section 4 Means of implementation.",ODS9
"Stating the MDG Report 2015 Africa made great strides towards the eight Millennium Development Goals. In many areas especially related to health and education the advance registered by Sub-Saharan Africa was the fastest among all developing regions. At the same time the Northern part of the continent met many of the targets including those on poverty and hunger reduction universal primary education children and mothers' health as well as sanitation.
Nevertheless many goals and targets have yet to be achieved:
In spite of the fact that the child mortality rate in Sub- Saharan Africa declined five times faster during 2005-2013 than it was 1990-1995 the region still detains the highest rate.
Furthermore 70% of its population still suffers from lack of access to improved sanitation facility 41% of its inhabitants still live in 2015 with less than $1.25 a day and out of the 57 million of global out-of-school children of primary school age in 2015 33 million are in Sub-Saharan Africa.
In the past two decades Northern Africa has not registered any improvements in women’s access to paid employment with women still holding less than one out of five paid jobs in the non-agricultural sector.
Therefore the Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development acknowledges that progress made in the last 15 years has been uneven particularly in Africa where some MDGs remained out of track  and reiterates the need to focus on this continent by recommitting ourselves to the full realization of all the MDGs including the off-track MDGs in particular by providing focused and scaled-up assistance to least developed countries and other countries in special situations in line with relevant support programmes. The new Agenda builds on the Millennium Development Goals and seeks to complete what these did not achieve particularly in reaching the most vulnerable.
In its target 4.b the Agenda highlights the necessity to substantially expand at global level the number of scholarships available to developing countries in particular least developed countries small island developing States and African countries for enrollment in higher education including vocational training and information and communications technology technical engineering and scientific programmes.
It is also committed in its target 9.a to facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial technological and technical support to African countries least developed countries landlocked developing countries and Small Island developing States. Whereas it its target 10.b it calls to encourage official development assistance and financial flows including foreign direct investment to States where the need is greatest in particular least developed countries African countries small island developing States and landlocked developing countries in accordance with their national plans and programmes.
Background information
Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio (1992) sustainable development remained elusive for many African countries with poverty being a major challenge and desertification deforestation and climate change its main treats.
Furthermore only 15% of the Sub-Saharan African rural population had access to electricity in 2012 and the continent sorely lacks important infrastructure investments. The absence of access to modern energy services is a grave obstacle to sustainable development as recognized by the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 and contributes greatly to Africa’s poverty trap.
The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) launched by African heads of state in 2001 has represented the response of African countries to those treats and challenges. NEPAD has indeed aimed at providing a framework for sustainable development to be shared by all Africa's people emphasizing the role of partnerships among African countries themselves and between them and the international community and proposed a shared and common vision to eradicate poverty through sustained economic growth and sustainable development.
African governments also reinforced the pace of regional integration through the rationalization of existing regional economic communities increasing the power of the African Union especially in the field of security and peace management.
These efforts have been supported by the international community with financial and technical contributions to regional communities and specific initiatives to foster African development. Thus the Heavily Indebted and Poor Countries (HIPC) program was initiated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1996 providing debt relief and low-interest loans to reduce external debt repayments to sustainable levels. Nominal debt service relief under HIPC to the 29 countries that have reached their decision points has been estimated to amount to about US$62 billion a significant share of which benefited Sub-Saharan African countries.
For the United Nations in particular Africa has been a priority area as illustrated by the establishment of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA) by the Secretary-General in 2003 and the reference to Africa's sustainable development as a cross-cutting issue in the  Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (see chapter VIII) which emerged from the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002.
A growing emphasis is being placed on the Nexus approach to sustainable development seeking to realize synergies from the links between development factors such as energy health education water food gender and economic growth. In this regard and as part of the follow up to the 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio+20 the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) in collaboration with SE4All UN-Energy and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) organized Global Conference on Rural Energy Access: A Nexus Approach to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication in Addis Ababa Ethiopia Dec 4 – 6 2013.

"Human settlements
Cities are hubs for ideas commerce culture science productivity social human and economic development. Urban planning transport systems water sanitation waste management disaster risk reduction access to information education and capacity-building are all relevant issues to sustainable urban development.
In 2008 for the first time in history the global urban population outnumbered the rural population. This milestone marked the advent of a new 'urban millennium' and by 2050 it is expected that two-thirds of the world population will be living in urban areas. With more than half of humankind living in cities and the number of urban residents growing by nearly 73 million every year it is estimated that urban areas account for 70 per cent of the world's gross domestic product and has therefore generated economic growth and prosperity for many.
Given the importance of this topic to global development efforts recent movements pushing to address sustainable development from an urban perspective have taken place throughout the world. Results from this movement can be seen in the inclusion of a stand-alone goal on cities and urban development in the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goal 11 make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable. There is also recognition of the cross-cutting nature of urban issues which have an impact on a number of other Sustainable Development Goals including SDGs 1 6 7 8 9 12 15 and 17 among others. UN-Habitat's complementary New Urban Agenda adopted as the outcome document from the Habitat III Conference in 2016 seeks to offer national and local guidelines on the growth and development of cities through 2036.
Prior to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda Millennium Development Goal 7 target 11 made a call for efforts to achieve a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020.
Sustainable human settlements development was also discussed at the second and third sessions of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Promoting sustainable human settlements development is the subject of Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 which calls for 1) providing adequate shelter for all; 2) improving human settlements management; 3) promoting sustainable land-use planning and management; 4) promoting the integrated provision of environmental infrastructure: water sanitation drainage and solid waste management; 5) promoting sustainable energy and transport systems in human settlements; 6) promoting human settlements planning and management in disaster-prone areas; 7) promoting sustainable construction industry activities; and 8) promoting human resource development and capacity-building for human settlements development.
Paragraph 89 of the 2030 Agenda calls on major groups and other stakeholders including local authorities to report on their contribution to the implementation of the Agenda. Local and regional governments have a wealth of valuable experience in the localization of the 2030 Agenda where they provide leadership in the mobilization of a wide range of stakeholders the facilitation of bottom-up and inclusive processes and the formation of multi-stakeholder partnerships.

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states that the Sustainable Development Gaols (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic social and environmental). The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. Accordingly the integrated and interlinked nature of the SDGs needs to inform and guide their mainstreaming into national planning frameworks in the form of national development plans or sustainable development strategies. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda depends on such an integrated approach which involves identifying possible synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their associated targets as well as developing context specific integrated approaches to ensure effective implementation.
The 2019 SDG Summit called on countries to “mainstream the 2030 Agenda into our national planning instruments policies strategies and financial frameworks”. The voluntary national reviews (VNRs) and other sources provide examples of approaches taken by countries to integrate the 2030 agenda into national plans and strategies. Countries are also integrating regional and continental agendas into their plans for instance the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. The SDGs are also being incorporated into plans and review processes at the sub-national as evidenced by the voluntary local reviews.
The integration of the SDGs – and sustainable development more broadly – builds on the experience with National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) which were included in 1992 in Agenda 21 (§ 8.7). Here countries were called upon to integrate economic social and environmental objectives into one strategically focused blueprint for action at the national level. The NSDS “should be developed through the widest possible participation”. And it “should be based on a thorough assessment of the current situation and initiatives”.
As seen at the Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development issues such as country ownership and strong political commitment the integration of economic social and environmental objectives across sectors territories and generations; broad participation and effective partnerships the development of capacity and enabling environment as well as the mobilization of means of implementations remain at the centre of policy debates at all levels.
More on NSDS
In the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly (23-28 June 1997) member States reaffirmed the importance of NSDS and set a target of 2002 for the formulation and elaboration of NSDS that reflect the contributions and responsibilities of all interested parties.
However by 2002 based on national reports received from governments only about 85 countries had developed some form of national strategies and the nature and effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably from country to country. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) through paragraph 162 b recommitted member States to “take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development and to begin their implementation by 2005.”
During the preparatory process for the 2002 WSSD the International Forum on NSDS was held in Accra Ghana in 2001 which led to the launch of the Guidance in Preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy. It defined National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) as “a coordinated participatory and iterative process of thoughts and actions to achieve economic environmental and social objectives in a balanced and integrative manner”. Most importantly NSDS is a call for an institutional change. It aims at a transition from the traditional static putting-a-plan-on-paper exercise towards the establishment of an adaptive system that can continuously improve. It should be a process which “encompasses situation analysis formulation of policies and action plans implementation monitoring and regular review. It is a cyclical and interactive process of planning participation and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a ‘plan’ as an end product.”
Every country needs to determine for itself how best to approach the preparation and implementation of its national sustainable development strategy depending upon the prevailing political historical cultural ecological circumstances. A blueprint approach for national sustainable development strategies is neither possible nor desirable. The particular label applied to a national sustainable development strategy is not important as long as the underlying principles characterizing a national sustainable development strategy are adhered to and that economic social and environmental objectives are balanced and integrated.
Today there is an increased interest in national development planning and for many countries their national plan or strategy - even if not labelled as an NSDS - is the chief means for incorporating the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs into the national policy framework.

"Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is an integral part of social and economic development and is essential if development is to be sustainable for the future. This has been recognized by several global documents on DRR and sustainable development. The Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World (1994) as the first major international framework for disaster risk reduction recognized the interrelation between sustainable development and DRR. Ever since this close interrelation was continuously strengthened within the key global agreements from MDGs to the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (Johannesburg September 2002) to the “Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015)” and to the “Future We Want” (Rio June 2012) to the Sendai Framework for DRR (Sendai Mach 2016) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (New York September 2015).
The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) addressed risk management and vulnerability in the context of its thematic issues of water sanitation and human settlements in its 2004-2005 cycle and then in the context of drought and desertification in its 2006-2007 cycle.
On the occasion of  World Water Day 2004 Guidelines for Reducing Flood Losses was launched. This inter-agency publication led by DESA aimed at providing decision-makers with a range of options to consider for reducing losses associated with flooding.
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai 14-18 March 2015) and as the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action is a 15-year voluntary non-binding agreement with seven targets and four priorities for action.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes and reaffirms the urgent need to reduce the risk of disasters. In addition to direct references to the outcomes of the Third UN Conference on DRR (Sendai Framework) there are specific opportunities to achieve SDGs through reducing disaster risk. For example by reducing exposure and vulnerability of the poor to disasters or building resilient infrastructure. There are also several SDGs and targets that can contribute to reducing disaster risk and building resilience even where disaster risk reduction is not explicit.
Targets related to promoting education for sustainable development under SDG# 4 such as building and upgrading education facilities and ensuring healthy lives as well as targets under SDG#11 (cities) and under SDG# 9 (building resilient infrastructure) reaffirm the interrelationship between disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. amongst others can be cited.",ODS11
"The role of transport in sustainable development was first recognized at the 1992 United Nation’s Earth Summit and reinforced in its outcome document – Agenda 21. In undertaking the five-year review of the implementation of Agenda 21 during its nineteenth Special Session in 1997 the UN General Assembly further noted that over the next twenty years transportation would be expected to be the major driving force behind a growing world demand for energy (Indeed it is now the largest end-use of energy in developed countries and the fastest growing one in most developing countries). Further at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development the role of transport was once again captured in the outcome document - the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI). JPOI provided multiple anchor points for sustainable transport in the context of infrastructure public transport systems goods delivery networks affordability efficiency and convenience of transportation as well as improving urban air quality and health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The global attention to transport has continued in recent years. World leaders recognized unanimously at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20) that transportation and mobility are central to sustainable development. Sustainable transportation can enhance economic growth and improve accessibility. Sustainable transport achieves better integration of the economy while respecting the environment. improving social equity health resilience of cities urban-rural linkages and productivity of rural areas
Subsequently the UN Secretary-General as part of his Five-Year Action Agenda identified transport as a major component of sustainable development. To this end the Secretary General established and launched in August 2014 a High Level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport (HLAG-ST) representing all modes of transport including road rail aviation marine ferry and urban public transport providers. The policy recommendations of the Advisory Group were submitted to the Secretary-General in a global sustainable transport outlook report entitled Mobilizing Sustainable Transport for Development released at the first Global Sustainable Transport Conference in November 2016.
The importance of sustainable transport for countries in special situations is also recognized by the international community through the Istanbul Programme of Action for the LDCs the Vienna Programme of Action for the LLDCs the SAMOA Pathway for SIDS the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the New Urban Agenda.
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sustainable transport is mainstreamed across several SDGs and targets especially those related to food security health energy economic growth infrastructure and cities and human settlements. The importance of transport for climate action is further recognized under the UNFCCC - the transport sector will be playing a particularly important role in the achievement of the Paris Agreement given the fact close to a quarter of energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions come from transport and that these emissions are projected to grow substantially in the years to come.

"Goal n.12 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
Paragraph 28 of the 2030 Agenda reads: “We (Countries) commit to making fundamental changes in the way that our societies produce and consume goods and services. Governments international organizations the business sector and other non-state actors and individuals must contribute to changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns including through the mobilization from all sources of financial and technical assistance to strengthen developing countries’ scientific technological and innovative capacities to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production. We encourage the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production. All countries take action with developed countries taking the lead taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries”.
The concept of sustainable consumption and production was later recognized in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation adopted in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). On that occasion sustainable consumption and production was identified as one of the three overarching objectives of and essential requirements for sustainable development together with poverty eradication and the management of natural resources in order to foster economic and social development. It was acknowledged that fundamental changes in the way societies produce and consume are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development.
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation also called for all countries to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns with the developed countries taking the lead and with all countries benefiting from the process taking into account the Rio principles including inter alia the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set out in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.
Furthermore the Plan called in its Chapter 3 “Changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production” for governments relevant international organizations the private sector and all major groups to play an active role in changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns and more specificallythrough its Paragraph 15 to Encourage and promote the development of a 10-year framework of programmes (10YFP) in support of regional and national initiatives to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production to promote social and economic development within the carrying capacity of ecosystems.
The 10- year framework of programme (10YFP) on sustainable consumption and production patterns was adopted at the Rio+20 Conference through Paragraph 226.
UNEP has been requested to serve as the 10YFP Secretariat and to establish and administer a Trust Fund to support SCP implementation in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. (A/C.2/67/L.45).
The Inter-Agency Coordination Group (IACG) of the 10YFP was established in May 2013 with the participation of 19 United Nations bodies. It is permanently chaired by UNEP and co-chaired for the period 2013-2015 by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

"Chemicals
Environmentally sound management of toxic chemicals is the topic of Chapter 19 of Agenda 21. A substantial use of chemicals is essential to meet the social and economic goals of the world community and these can be used with a high degree of safety when best practices are followed. However much remains to be done. Two of the major problems identified in Agenda 21 particularly in developing countries are
1. lack of sufficient scientific information for the risk assessment and
2. lack of resources of assessment of chemicals for which data are at hand.
Gross chemical contamination with grave damage to human health genetic structures and reproductive outcomes and the environment has been continuing within some of the world's most important industrial areas and restoration will require major investment as well as the development of new techniques.
Chapter 19 contains six programme areas as follows:
expanding and accelerating international assessment of chemical risks;
harmonization of classification and labelling of chemicals;
information exchange on toxic chemicals and chemical risks;
establishment of risk reduction programmes;
strengthening of national capabilities and capacities for management of chemicals; and
prevention of illegal international traffic in toxic and dangerous products.
In paragraph 23 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI 2002) Member States renewed the commitment as advanced in Agenda 21 to sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of hazardous wastes for sustainable development as well as for the protection of human health and the environment inter alia aiming to achieve by 2020 that chemicals are used and produced in ways that lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment using transparent science-based risk assessment procedures and science-based risk management procedures taking into account the precautionary approach as set out in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and support developing countries in strengthening their capacity for the sound management of chemicals and hazardous wastes by providing technical and financial assistance.
The focus provided by Agenda 21 and JPOI on the sound management of chemicals led to a number of developments which culminated in 2006 with the adoption of the Dubai Declaration on International Chemicals Management and the formal establishment of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM).
At its second fifth eighteenth and nineteenth sessions held in 1994 1997 2010 and 2011 respectively the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) had substantive discussions on sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle.
In The Future We Want the outcome document of Rio+20 (2012) Member States reaffirmed their commitment to achieve by 2020 the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of hazardous waste in ways that lead to minimization of significant adverse effects to human health and the environment as set out in the JPOI. They also called for the effective implementation and strengthening of the SAICM.
In Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Member States re-confirmed to reduce the negative impacts of urban activities and of chemicals which are hazardous for human health and the environment including through the environmentally sound management and safe use of chemicals the reduction and recycling of waste and the more efficient use of water and energy . In Sustainable Development Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages in target 3.9 Member States decided to by 2030 substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air water and soil pollution and contamination. In Goal 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all target 6.3 Member States decided to by 2030 improve water quality by reducing pollution eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. In Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns target 12.4 Member States reiterated to by 2020 achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle in accordance with agreed international frameworks and significantly reduce their release to air water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.

Waste (Hazardous)
Environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes is the subject of Chapter 20 of Agenda 21. Effective control of the generation storage treatment recycling and reuse transport recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes is according to Agenda 21 of paramount importance for proper health environmental protection and natural resource management and sustainable development. Prevention of the generation of hazardous wastes and the rehabilitation of contaminated sites are the key elements and both require knowledge experienced people facilities financial resources and technical and scientific capacities.
Among the overall targets of Chapter 20 are the following:
1. preventing or minimizing the generation of hazardous wastes as part of an overall integrated cleaner production approach;
2. eliminating or reducing to a minimum transboundary movements of hazardous waste;
3. ratifying the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal;
4. ratifying and full implementation of the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa; and
5. eliminating the export of hazardous wastes to countries that prohibit such imports.
Managing hazardous wastes was discussed by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) at its second fifth seventh eighteenth and nineteenth sessions and by the General Assembly at its nineteenth Special Session.
In paragraph 23 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI 2002) Member States renewed the commitment as advanced in Agenda 21 to sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of hazardous wastes for sustainable development as well as for the protection of human health and the environment.
In 2004 the Ministerial Statement on Partnerships for Meeting the Global Waste Challenge was adopted at the seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. The Statement recognizes the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes as part of the wider issues of water protection improved sanitation solid waste management and economic and social development. It calls for the reduction of the impacts of hazardous wastes on human health and the environment and promotes a fundamental shift in emphasis from remedial measures to preventive measures such as reduction at source reuse recycling and recovery. It recognizes the importance of mobilizing new and additional financial resources to build partnerships to meet the global waste challenge worldwide.
In The Future We Want the outcome document of Rio+20 (2012) Member States reaffirmed their commitment to achieve by 2020 the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of hazardous waste in ways that lead to minimization of significant adverse effects to human health and the environment as set out in the JPOI.

Waste (Solid)
Management of solid wastes and sewage are the subject of Chapter 21 of Agenda 21.
As considered in Chapter 21 solid wastes include all domestic refuse and non-hazardous wastes such as commercial and institutional wastes street sweepings and construction debris and in some countries human wastes. Hazardous waste is frequently intermixed with other waste posing particular management challenges.
Chapter 21 was considered by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) at its second fifth sixth seventh eighteenth and nineteenth sessions.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 Governments reaffirmed the importance of solid waste management. They called for priority attention to be given to waste prevention and minimization reuse and recycling. They also called for the development of environmentally sound disposal facilities including technology to convert waste into energy.
In Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Sustainable Development Goal 11  Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable target 11.6 Member States decided toby 2030 reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. In Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Member States also decided to in target 12.3 by 2030 halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains including post-harvest losses and reiterated in target 12.4 by 2020 achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle in accordance with agreed international frameworks and significantly reduce their release to air water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment. In target 12.5 Member States decided to by 2030 substantially reduce waste generation through prevention reduction recycling and reuse.
For additional information see the UNEP waste management website.

Waste (Radioactive)
The safe and environmentally sound management of radioactive wastes is the subject of Chapter 22 of Agenda 21. The chapter notes that the radiological and safety risk from radioactive waste varies from very low for short-lived low-level waste to very large for high-level waste. Annually about 200000 m3 of low-level and intermediate-level waste and 10000 m3 of high-level waste (as well as spent nuclear fuel destined for final disposal) are generated worldwide from nuclear power production and these volumes are increasing.
The objective of Chapter 22 is to ensure that radioactive waste is safely managed transported stored and disposed of with a view to protecting human health and the environment within the wider framework of an interactive and integrated approach to radioactive waste management and safety.
The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) considered the safety of radioactive wastes during its fifth session in 1997 seventh session in 1999 in relation to transboundary movement of this waste and again during its ninth session in 2001 in relation to nuclear energy technologies.
As a result of its deliberations on this issue the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 stressed the importance of effective liability measures for international maritime transportation and other transboundary movement of radioactive material radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and encouraged Governments to examine and improve measures and internationally agreed regulations regarding the safe handling transport and disposal of this waste.",ODS12
"The science is clear: our climate is heating rapidly. The average global temperatures have increased by 1.2 degrees Celsius since 1880 particularly in the late 20th century. The concentration of atmospheric CO2 the GHG that contributes more than 2/3 to global warming is at its highest level ever. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) steadily points out that human activities have warmed the atmosphere ocean and land producing widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere ocean cryosphere and biosphere. Due to these changes in climate the number of weather climate and water-related disasters has increased by a factor of five over the past 50 years causing over 2 million deaths and US$3.64 trillion in losses.
According to IPCC warming beyond 1.5 degrees could have irreversible and irreparable consequences. However effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions can significantly reduce vulnerability and contribute to climate resilience. To limit global warming to well below 2 preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels countries came together to hold themselves accountable under the Paris Agreement. The agreement is a milestone of international cooperation to tackle climate change – first legally binding document in the history of climate action.
To move fast in the race against climate crisis targeted actions that bring tangible benefits and limit the trade-offs on multiple fronts are key for common success against climate change. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the world’s plan of action to achieving sustainability and resilience for people and planet are closely linked with climate. Maximizing on the interlinkages between the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement by leveraging Climate and SDG Synergies has the potential of achieving both agendas and guaranteeing a livable future for next generations by leaving no one behind. In fact progress made towards limiting global temperature increase would significantly ease the path to many other SDGs such as those related to poverty hunger access to water and terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Many of the SDGs and their targets can also be achieved in ways that would enable adaptive responses to climate change for example those related to resilience in SDGs 9 and 11 respectively relating to infrastructure and urban settlements.
UN DESA is moving the needle forward for harnessing synergies across development and climate action. Through its support to various intergovernmental processes and fora UN DESA is working to improve coordination with other entities by using the 2030 Agenda as both a framework and guiding principles.




CLIMATE ACTION STARTING NOW

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states that the Sustainable Development Gaols (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic social and environmental). The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. Accordingly the integrated and interlinked nature of the SDGs needs to inform and guide their mainstreaming into national planning frameworks in the form of national development plans or sustainable development strategies. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda depends on such an integrated approach which involves identifying possible synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their associated targets as well as developing context specific integrated approaches to ensure effective implementation.
The 2019 SDG Summit called on countries to “mainstream the 2030 Agenda into our national planning instruments policies strategies and financial frameworks”. The voluntary national reviews (VNRs) and other sources provide examples of approaches taken by countries to integrate the 2030 agenda into national plans and strategies. Countries are also integrating regional and continental agendas into their plans for instance the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. The SDGs are also being incorporated into plans and review processes at the sub-national as evidenced by the voluntary local reviews.
The integration of the SDGs – and sustainable development more broadly – builds on the experience with National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) which were included in 1992 in Agenda 21 (§ 8.7). Here countries were called upon to integrate economic social and environmental objectives into one strategically focused blueprint for action at the national level. The NSDS “should be developed through the widest possible participation”. And it “should be based on a thorough assessment of the current situation and initiatives”.
As seen at the Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development issues such as country ownership and strong political commitment the integration of economic social and environmental objectives across sectors territories and generations; broad participation and effective partnerships the development of capacity and enabling environment as well as the mobilization of means of implementations remain at the centre of policy debates at all levels.
More on NSDS
In the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly (23-28 June 1997) member States reaffirmed the importance of NSDS and set a target of 2002 for the formulation and elaboration of NSDS that reflect the contributions and responsibilities of all interested parties.
However by 2002 based on national reports received from governments only about 85 countries had developed some form of national strategies and the nature and effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably from country to country. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) through paragraph 162 b recommitted member States to “take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development and to begin their implementation by 2005.”
During the preparatory process for the 2002 WSSD the International Forum on NSDS was held in Accra Ghana in 2001 which led to the launch of the Guidance in Preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy. It defined National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) as “a coordinated participatory and iterative process of thoughts and actions to achieve economic environmental and social objectives in a balanced and integrative manner”. Most importantly NSDS is a call for an institutional change. It aims at a transition from the traditional static putting-a-plan-on-paper exercise towards the establishment of an adaptive system that can continuously improve. It should be a process which “encompasses situation analysis formulation of policies and action plans implementation monitoring and regular review. It is a cyclical and interactive process of planning participation and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a ‘plan’ as an end product.”
Every country needs to determine for itself how best to approach the preparation and implementation of its national sustainable development strategy depending upon the prevailing political historical cultural ecological circumstances. A blueprint approach for national sustainable development strategies is neither possible nor desirable. The particular label applied to a national sustainable development strategy is not important as long as the underlying principles characterizing a national sustainable development strategy are adhered to and that economic social and environmental objectives are balanced and integrated.
Today there is an increased interest in national development planning and for many countries their national plan or strategy - even if not labelled as an NSDS - is the chief means for incorporating the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs into the national policy framework.

"Oceans seas and coastal areas form an integrated and essential component of the Earth’s ecosystem and are critical to sustainable development. They cover more than two-thirds of the earth’s surface and contain 97% of the planet’s water. Oceans contribute to poverty eradication by creating sustainable livelihoods and decent work. Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods. In addition oceans are crucial for global food security and human health. They are also the primary regulator of the global climate an important sink for greenhouse gases and they provide us with water and the oxygen we breathe. Finally oceans host huge reservoirs of biodiversity.
The importance of oceans for sustainable development is widely recognized by the international community and embodied in Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and various decisions taken by the Commission on Sustainable Development. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment emphasizes that all humans depend on the Earth’s ecosystems and the services they provide. In the Rio+20 outcome documentThe future we want Member States called for “holistic and integrated approaches to sustainable development that will guide humanity to live in harmony with nature and lead to efforts to restore the health and integrity of the Earth’s ecosystem”. In this context they stressed among others the importance of “the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and seas and of their resources for sustainable development including through their contributions to poverty eradication sustained economic growth food security and creation of sustainable livelihoods and decent work…”. Accordingly the Proposal of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in August 2014 contained sustainable development goal (SDG) 14 which aims to “Conserve and sustainable use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development”. Issues related to oceans and seas are addressed in the 10 targets under SDG 14 as well as many other related SDGs under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the posst-2015 development agenda in 2015.
In order for oceans seas and marine resources to successfully contribute to human well-being ecosystem integrity with properly functioning biogeochemical and physical processes is required. This does not require unperturbed systems but systems that have not suffered serious or irreversible harm. Ecosystem integrity allows for the provision of so-called supporting ecosystem services which in turn are the bases of important regulating provisioning and cultural ecosystem services that are of crucial importance for humans. Whereas the benefits provided by oceans seas and marine resources are important to all people the poor indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups with a high dependency on natural resources and ecosystem services may have their well-being especially tied to these benefits. The link between oceans seas and marine resources and human well-being is not one-sided. While an increase in human well-being is frequently generated at the cost of ecosystem integrity it can also potentially reduce the negative anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment due to a more sustainable use of resources changes in production and consumption patterns and improved management and control of human activities for example. In order for this to happen good governance and an enabling environment are however required.
Oceans seas and marine resources are increasingly threatened degraded or destroyed by human activities reducing their ability to provide crucial ecosystem services. Important classes of threats are among others climate change marine pollution unsustainable extraction of marine resources and physical alterations and destruction of marine and coastal habitats and landscapes. The deterioration of coastal and marine ecosystems and habitats is negatively affecting human well-being worldwide.
Good governance an enabling environment sustainable land- and marine- based human activities and adequate measures will be required to reduce the negative anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment for example due to a more sustainable use of resources changes in production and consumption patterns and improved management and control of human activities. Projects and measures should ideally be designed and implemented in an integrated cross-sectoral and cross-scale manner in line with the ecosystem approach and involving all stakeholders.
Human well-being cannot be achieved without the protection and conservation of the Earth’s ecosystem. To maintain the quality of life that the oceans have provided to humankind while sustaining the integrity of their ecosystems a change will be required in how humans view manage and use oceans seas and marine resources.

Member States also recognized “the severity of global biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems” and stress the negative impact that this situation has on food security nutrition access to water health of the rural poor and people worldwide”.
Furthermore the Future We Want reiterated the importance of implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted at the Tenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
Biodiversity was discussed by the Commission on Sustainable Development on several occasions and was one of the themes of the 2012/2013 two-year cycle.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg 2002 biological diversity was addressed in Chapter IV paragraph 44 of the outcome of the Summit the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. The Summit also endorsed the target to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss at global regional and national levels as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth which had some months earlier been adopted by the sixth meeting of the CBD Conference of Parties (COP).
Conservation of biological diversity is the subject of Chapter 15 of Agenda 21 which was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. On the same occasion the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was opened for signature and remained open for signature until 4 June 1993. By that time it had received 168 signatures. The Convention entered into force on 29 December 1993 90 days after the 30th ratification. The first session of the Conference of the Parties was scheduled for 28 November – 9 December 1994 in the Bahamas.

"Sustainable Development Goal 15 aims to “protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.
Forests have a significant role in reducing the risk of natural disasters including floods droughts landslides and other extreme events. At global level forests mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration contribute to the balance of oxygen carbon dioxide and humidity in the air and protect watersheds which supply 75% of freshwater worldwide.
Investing in forests and forestry represent an investment in people and their livelihoods especially the rural poor youth and women. Around 1.6 billion people - including more than 2000 indigenous cultures - depend on forests for their livelihood.
Forests are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems on land home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of animals plants and insects. They also provide shelter jobs and security for forest-dependent communities.
Therefore the future of forests and forestry in sustainable development at all levels was at the core of the XIV World Forestry hosted in Durban from 7 to 11 September 2015. The Durban Declaration called for new partnerships among forest agriculture finance energy water and other sectors as well the engagement with indigenous people and local community.
The importance of investing in world’s forests and of taking “political commitment at the highest levels smart policies effective law enforcement innovative partnerships and funding” was also recalled by the UN Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki-moon in his Message on the occasion of the 2015 International Day of Forests.
Both the International Day of Forests launched in 2013 and the International Year of Forest proclaimed for 2011 aimed at raising awareness on the importance of all types of forests and of trees outside forests.
Prior to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference the Future We Want in its paragraphs 193- 196 stress the importance of improving the livelihoods of people and communities by creating the conditions required to sustainably manage forests. It also recognizes the role of the UN Forum on Forests in addressing forest-related issues in a holistic and integrated manner and in promoting international policy coordination and cooperation in order to achieve forest management. Paragraph 196 calls for the mainstreaming of sustainable forest management and practises into economic policy and decision-making.
Chapter 11 of Agenda 21 is entitled ‘Combating Deforestation’ and is devoted to sustain the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests forest lands and woodlands.
On one side the Agenda highlights the major weaknesses in the policies methods and mechanisms adopted to support trees forests and forest lands and the multiple ecological economic social and cultural roles.
Therefore on the other side it identifies among its objectives the strengthening of forest-related national institutions the enhancement of the scope and effectiveness of activities related to the management conservation and sustainable development of forests and the sustainable utilization and production of forests' goods and services in both the developed and the developing countries.
The Agenda also mentions the importance to improve human technical and professional skills as well as expertise and capabilities to effectively formulate and implement policies plans programmes research and projects on management conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests and forest-based resources and forest lands inclusive as well as other areas from which forest benefits can be derived.",ODS15

The relevance of efforts underway to promote scientific research and strengthen the scientific base of activities to address desertification and drought under the UNCCD is also addressed.
Combating desertification and drought were discussed by the Commission on Sustainable Development in several sessions. In the framework of the Commission's multi-year work programme CSD 16-17 focused respectively in 2008 and 2009 on desertification and drought along with the interrelated issues of Land Agriculture Rural development and Africa.
In accordance with its multi-year programme of work CSD-8 in 2000 reviewed integrated planning and management of land resources as its sectoral theme.

The sectoral cluster of land desertification forests and biodiversity as well as mountains (chapters 10-13 and 15 of Agenda 21) were considered by CSD-3 in 1995 and again at the five-year review in 1997.
The UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) called upon the United Nations General Assembly to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INCD) to prepare by June 1994 an international convention to combat desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification particularly in Africa. The Convention was adopted in Paris on 17 June 1994 and opened for signature there on 14-15 October 1994. It entered into force on 26 December 1996.
Deserts are among the fragile ecosystems addressed by Agenda 21 and combating desertification and drought is the subject of Chapter 12. Desertification includes land degradation in arid semi-arid and dry sub humid areas resulting from various factors including climatic variations and human activities. Desertification affects as much as one-sixth of the world's population seventy percent of all drylands and one-quarter of the total land area of the world. It results in widespread poverty as well as in the degradation of billion hectares of rangeland and cropland.
Integrated planning and management of land resources is the subject of chapter 10 of Agenda 21 which deals with the cross-sectoral aspects of decision-making for the sustainable use and development of natural resources including the soils minerals water and biota that land comprises. This broad integrative view of land resources which are essential for life-support systems and the productive capacity of the environment is the basis of Agenda 21's and the Commission on Sustainable Development's consideration of land issues.
Expanding human requirements and economic activities are placing ever increasing pressures on land resources creating competition and conflicts and resulting in suboptimal use of resources. By examining all uses of land in an integrated manner it makes it possible to minimize conflicts to make the most efficient trade-offs and to link social and economic development with environmental protection and enhancement thus helping to achieve the objectives of sustainable development.

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states that the Sustainable Development Gaols (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic social and environmental). The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. Accordingly the integrated and interlinked nature of the SDGs needs to inform and guide their mainstreaming into national planning frameworks in the form of national development plans or sustainable development strategies. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda depends on such an integrated approach which involves identifying possible synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their associated targets as well as developing context specific integrated approaches to ensure effective implementation.
The 2019 SDG Summit called on countries to “mainstream the 2030 Agenda into our national planning instruments policies strategies and financial frameworks”. The voluntary national reviews (VNRs) and other sources provide examples of approaches taken by countries to integrate the 2030 agenda into national plans and strategies. Countries are also integrating regional and continental agendas into their plans for instance the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. The SDGs are also being incorporated into plans and review processes at the sub-national as evidenced by the voluntary local reviews.
The integration of the SDGs – and sustainable development more broadly – builds on the experience with National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) which were included in 1992 in Agenda 21 (§ 8.7). Here countries were called upon to integrate economic social and environmental objectives into one strategically focused blueprint for action at the national level. The NSDS “should be developed through the widest possible participation”. And it “should be based on a thorough assessment of the current situation and initiatives”.
As seen at the Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development issues such as country ownership and strong political commitment the integration of economic social and environmental objectives across sectors territories and generations; broad participation and effective partnerships the development of capacity and enabling environment as well as the mobilization of means of implementations remain at the centre of policy debates at all levels.
More on NSDS
In the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly (23-28 June 1997) member States reaffirmed the importance of NSDS and set a target of 2002 for the formulation and elaboration of NSDS that reflect the contributions and responsibilities of all interested parties.
However by 2002 based on national reports received from governments only about 85 countries had developed some form of national strategies and the nature and effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably from country to country. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) through paragraph 162 b recommitted member States to “take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development and to begin their implementation by 2005.”
During the preparatory process for the 2002 WSSD the International Forum on NSDS was held in Accra Ghana in 2001 which led to the launch of the Guidance in Preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy. It defined National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) as “a coordinated participatory and iterative process of thoughts and actions to achieve economic environmental and social objectives in a balanced and integrative manner”. Most importantly NSDS is a call for an institutional change. It aims at a transition from the traditional static putting-a-plan-on-paper exercise towards the establishment of an adaptive system that can continuously improve. It should be a process which “encompasses situation analysis formulation of policies and action plans implementation monitoring and regular review. It is a cyclical and interactive process of planning participation and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a ‘plan’ as an end product.”
Every country needs to determine for itself how best to approach the preparation and implementation of its national sustainable development strategy depending upon the prevailing political historical cultural ecological circumstances. A blueprint approach for national sustainable development strategies is neither possible nor desirable. The particular label applied to a national sustainable development strategy is not important as long as the underlying principles characterizing a national sustainable development strategy are adhered to and that economic social and environmental objectives are balanced and integrated.
Today there is an increased interest in national development planning and for many countries their national plan or strategy - even if not labelled as an NSDS - is the chief means for incorporating the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs into the national policy framework.

"In its para 33 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on the impact that sustainable management of natural resources has on social and economic development and therefore on the importance of conservation and sustainable use of oceans and seas freshwater resources as well as forests mountains and drylands and of the protection of biodiversity ecosystems and wildlife.
Furthermore the need to “Protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss” is set as Sustainable Development Goal 15 of the 2030 Agenda.
Target n.1 of SDG 15 in particular explicitly mentions mountains among the ecosystems to be conserved restored and sustainably used in line with international agreements.
The outcome document of the Rio + 20 Conference the Future We Want recognizes through paragraphs 210-212 both the benefits derived from mountain regions as essential for sustainable development and the crucial role played by Mountain ecosystems in providing water resources to a large portion of the world's population. It also acknowledges the importance of mountains as home to indigenous people and local communities.
The Future We Want warns about the vulnerability of fragile mountain ecosystems to the adverse impacts of climate change deforestation and forest degradation land use change land degradation and natural disasters the marginalisation of its communities. Therefore it invites States to reinforce cooperative action with effective involvement and sharing of experience of all relevant stakeholders and to adopt a long-term vision and holistic approaches including through incorporating mountain-specific policies into national sustainable development strategies which could include inter alia poverty reduction plans and programmes for mountain areas particularly in developing countries.
Prior to Rio+20 Sustainable Mountain Development was discussed at the third session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the nineteenth Special Session of the General Assembly held in 1997. The following year the General Assembly also proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains by adopting without a vote a draft resolution recommended by the Economic and Social Council.
Sustainable Mountain Development is also the subject of Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 which notes that mountains are an important source of water energy biological diversity key resources such as minerals forest products and agricultural products and of recreation. Mountain environments represent major ecosystems which are essential to the survival of the global ecosystem but they are rapidly changing. Many global mountain areas are experiencing environmental degradation. At the same time about ten percent of the world's population depends directly on mountain resources and a much larger percentage draws on mountain resources including and especially water.
Chapter 13 also includes two programme areas to further elaborate the problem of fragile mountain ecosystems. These are:
Generating and strengthening knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems; and
Promoting integrated watershed development and alternative livelihood opportunities.

"The Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA) adopted in 1994 further complemented by The Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) of 2005 and MSI+5 Outcome document recognized that although they are afflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by development imperatives similar to those of developing countries generally small island developing States (SIDS) have their own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics. SIDS’ unique and particular vulnerabilities are highlighted in “The Future We Want” adopted at The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20) that took place in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in June 2012 - their small size remoteness narrow resource and export base and exposure to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks including to a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters (para 178). SIDS continue to address those structural and external challenges to achieve their sustainable development.
The Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia Samoa in September 2014 with the overarching theme of “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships”. Nearly 300 partnerships were announced at the conference and monitored through the Partnership Platform. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) adopted at the Conference addresses priority areas for SIDS and calls for urgent actions and support for SIDS’ efforts to achieve their sustainable development.
UN-DESA  leads inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system through the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs Plus (ECESA Plus) and among UN and non-UN entities active on SIDS issues through the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) on SIDS to monitor the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway as well as the progress being made in the SIDS partnerships. Moreover UN-DESA and particularly the SIDS Unit provides technical assistance and advice supports intergovernmental processes and reports on progress made in the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway.

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on decision-making with particular reference to participation of vulnerable groups such as women (SDG target 5.5) developing countries including African countries least developed countries land-locked developing countries small-island developing States and middle-income countries (SDG target 10.6) to the decision-making process. Furthermore SDG target 16.7 aims to “Ensure responsive inclusive participatory and representative decision-making at all levels”. The 2030 Agenda also highlights in its paragraph 48 the importance indicators have for decision-making.
In the Rio+20 Conference outcome document the Future We Want paragraph 14 recognizes that “opportunities for people to influence their lives and future participate in decision-making and voice their concerns are fundamental for sustainable development” and reaffirms respectively in paragraph 19 “ the continued need for the full and effective participation of all countries in particular developing countries in global decision-making” and in Paragraph 31 the “commitments to ensure women's equal rights access and opportunities for participation and leadership in the economy society and political decision-making”.
An important role is also recognized to major groups and other stakeholders. In the outcome document of the Future We Want member states “agree to work more closely with major groups and other stakeholders and encourage their active participation as appropriate in processes that contribute to decision-making planning and implementation of policies and programmes for sustainable development at all levels” as per paragraph 43.
Paragraph 276 of the Future We Want acknowledges “the need to facilitate informed policy decision-making on sustainable development issues and in this regard to strengthen the science-policy interface” whereas paragraph 279 reiterates “participation and representation of men and women scientists and researchers from developing and developed countries in processes related to global environmental and sustainable development assessment and monitoring with the purpose of enhancing national capabilities and the quality of research for policy- and decision-making processes”.
Both the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 and the Commission on Sustainable Development emphasized the importance of information for sound decision-making.
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) focuses in paragraph 7d on women’s access and full participation to decision-making. Paragraph 19 takes into consideration the importance of integrating sustainable development into decision-making processes at all levels. Whereas paragraph 86 describes the importance of consolidating the reform process of existing financial systems in order to “provide for the effective participation of developing countries in the international economic decision-making processes”. Furthermore the need to “improve policy and decision -making at all levels” and in particular through an “improved collaboration” between science and policy-makers is stressed in paragraph 109 e.
Chapter 8 of Agenda calls on countries to improve or restructure the decision-making process so that consideration of socio-economic and environmental issues is fully integrated and a broader range of public participation assured. It also calls on countries to adopt national strategies for sustainable development (NSDS) that should build upon and harmonize the various sectoral economic social and environmental policies and plans that are operating in the country.
Furthermore chapter 40 of Agenda 21 focuses on information for decision-making and emphasizes that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information considered in the broad sense. That includes data information experience and knowledge. The need for information arises at all levels from that of senior decision-maker at the national and international levels to the grass-roots and individual levels.",ODS16
"As far as the 2030 Agenda is concerned Goal 16 is devoted to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development the provision of access to justice for all and to the establishment of effective accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Goal 17 is related to strengthening the means of implementation and revitalization of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

The strengthening of the framework to finance sustainable development and the means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda is ensured by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The Addis Agenda is the outcome document adopted at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015 and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015.

With the adoption of “Future We Want” the outcome document of the Rio +20 conference held from 20 to 22 June 2012 Member States decided “to establish a universal intergovernmental high-level political forum building on the strengths experiences resources and inclusive participation modalities of the Commission on Sustainable Development and subsequently replacing the Commission. The high-level political forum shall follow up on the implementation of sustainable development and should avoid overlap with existing structures bodies and entities in a cost-effective manner.”

The High-level Political Forum on sustainable development is today the main United Nations platform on sustainable development. It provides political leadership guidance and recommendations.

It addresses new and emerging challenges; promotes the science-policy interface and enhances the integration of economic social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.",ODS16
"The protection of children from all forms of violence is a fundamental right enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The inclusion of a specific target (SDG 16.2) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end all forms of violence against children gives renewed impetus towards the realization of the right of every child to live free from fear neglect abuse and exploitation. Several other SDG targets address specific forms of violence and harm towards children such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (target 5.3) and the eradication of child labor including the recruitment and use of child soldiers (target 8.7).
To gain a better understanding of the nature extent and causes of violence against children and of measures designed to increase their protection the United Nations conducted a comprehensive study in 2006 with clear recommendations for action. The Secretary-General appointed a Special Representative on Violence against Children to monitor progress on implementation of the recommendations of the study and ensure its effective follow-up.
One billion children globally experience some form of emotional physical or sexual violence every year; and one child dies as a result of violence every five minutes. Although of epidemic proportions violence against children often remains hidden and socially condoned.
Violence against children knows no boundaries of culture class education income or ethnic origin. It takes place in institutions designed for their care and protection in schools online and also within the home. Most girls and boys who are exposed to violence live in isolation loneliness and fear and do not know where to turn for help especially when the perpetrator is someone close and on whom they depend for their protection and well-being. Younger children are especially at risk from violence as they are less able to speak up and seek support and it can cause irreversible damage to their development. Gender disability poverty or national or ethnic origin are some of the risk factors that can place children at high risk of violence.
Peer-on-peer violence by children is also a concern with studies showing that between 25-50 per cent of children have been victims of bullying. The growth in cyberbullying is equally troubling with its harmful messages spreading fast and far and fueled by perpetrators’ anonymity.
Violence has serious and long lasting consequences for its victims and can have a major impact on the health development and school performance of children. It also slows social progress by generating huge economic costs hindering sustainable development and eroding human capital. According to one study the global costs of violence against children could be as high as US$7 trillion per year.
Violence against children can be prevented and there has been real progress over recent years as highlighted by the 2013 Global Survey on Violence against Children and the Annual Reports of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly.
In support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda targets new partnerships and alliances are forming; new international standards on children’s protection from violence including trafficking sexual abuse and exploitation have been adopted; a large number of states have adopted a national comprehensive policy agenda on violence prevention and response and enacted legislation to prohibit physical mental and sexual violence and to safeguard the rights of child victims; information campaigns have raised awareness of the negative impact of violence on child development and of positive practices to prevent its occurrence; and children’s protection from bullying domestic violence sexual violence and harmful practices are being tackled through new global initiatives. There is also increased investment in generating sound evidence on the scale and nature of violence against children and on effective strategies to prevent it and in promoting and monitoring progress towards its elimination.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents us with an historic opportunity to place the protection of children at the heart of the policy actions of every nation and to build a world where all children everywhere enjoy freedom from fear and from violence in all its forms.
2019 represents a strategic milestone in this journey. Firstly the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in July will assess progress on the implementation of the SDGs under the theme ‘empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality’ and will review the targets related to violence against children under Goal 16 as well as those under Goals 4 (education) and 8 (decent work and economic growth). Secondly in September World leaders will gather under the first General Assembly Summit to review progress made in the implementation of the entire 2030 Agenda providing high-level political guidance for the second phase of implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Thirdly in November the UN General Assembly will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) the most widely ratified UN treaty. 2019 also marks the 10th anniversary of the mandate of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Violence against Children. 2019 therefore provides an important opportunity to gain a comprehensive picture of how far we have come in ensuring children’s safety and protection; what gaps remain and how to best accelerate progress to end all violence against children by 2030.

The achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals require all hands on deck. It require different sectors and actors working together in an integrated manner by pooling financial resources knowledge and expertise. In our new development era with 17 intertwined Sustainable Development Goals and 169 associated targets as a blue-print for achieving the sustainable Future We Want cross sectorial and innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships will play a crucial role for getting us to where we need by the year 2030.
Partnerships for sustainable development are multi-stakeholder initiatives voluntarily undertaken by Governments intergovernmental organizations major groups and others stakeholders which efforts are contributing to the implementation of inter-governmentally agreed development goals and commitments as included in Agenda 21 the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation the Millennium Declaration the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) entitled “The Future We Want” the Third International Conference on Small island Developing States and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Sustainable Development Goal 17 which reads “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development” recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge expertise technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries particularly developing countries. Goal 17 further seek to encourage and promote effective public public-private and civil society partnerships building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships.
Our work
The Division for SDGs supports facilitates and monitors multi-stakeholder partnerships and voluntary commitments forged in support of sustainable development and the SDGs. announced at various international sustainable development conferences.
The Division also maintains the Partnerships for SDGs online platform – a global registry of commitments and multi-stakeholder partnerships made through various UN conferences in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include the SDG Summit (2019) the UN Ocean Conferences (2017 and 2021) the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Conference (2014) and the Rio+20 Conference (2012) among others.
Following the 2014 Third International Conference the Small Island Developing States (SIDS)Partnership Framework was established by the General Assembly with the purpose of monitoring progress of existing and stimulating the launch of new genuine and durable partnerships for the sustainable development of SIDS. The Division in collaboration with OHRLLS is the supporting Secretariat to the framework.
In collaboration with several partners In 2019 the Division launched in collaboration with partners the 2030 Agenda Partnership Accelerator to help accelerate and scale up effective partnerships to advance the SDGs. The initiative provides research on effective partnership practices and capacity development of relevant stakeholders to develop and implement partnerships to advance the SDGs. A particular focus of the Partnership Accelerator is to support developing countries in forging new partnerships to advance the SDGs by strengthening collaboration between stakeholders and sectors at the national level.

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development describes in paragraph 70 the composition and task of the Technology Facilitation Mechanism established by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and aimed at supporting the Sustainable Development Goals. More specifically paragraph 70 of the 2030 Agenda reads:  “the Technology Facilitation Mechanism will be based on a multi-stakeholder collaboration between Member States civil society private sector scientific community United Nations entities and other stakeholders and will be composed of: a United Nations Interagency Task Team on Science Technology and Innovation for the SDGs a collaborative Multistakeholder Forum on Science Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and an on-line platform.”
Sustainable Development Goals Targets 17.6 and 17.8 respectively aim to “Enhance North-South South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms in particular at the United Nations level and through a global technology facilitation mechanism“ and to “fully operationalize the technology bank and science technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology in particular information and communications technology”.
Prior to the 2030 Agenda the Rio+20 outcome document The Future We Want called for a Global Sustainable Development Report to bring together dispersed information and existing assessments and to strengthen the science–policy interface at the High-level Political Forum on sustainable development (HLPF) through Paragraph 85.k.
As recalled by the Prototype Global Sustainable Report published in 2014 the United Nations Secretary-General tasked following Rio+20 the Division for Sustainable Development of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to undertake “in-depth analysis and evaluation of trends and scientific analysis in the implementation of sustainable development including lessons learned best practices and new challenges and cross-sectoral analysis of sustainable development issues”.
On that occasion it was decided to produce a “prototype” report to facilitate dialogue between scientists and decision-makers and to establish for this purpose a United Nations system task team.
Decisions related to science were also taken by the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002 by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its third (1995) fifth (1997) and sixth (1998) sessions and by the United Nations General Assembly at its Special Session to review the implementation of Agenda 21 (1997).
The Plan of Implementation adopted by WSSD underlined the importance of science-based decision-making inter alia by: integrating scientists' advice into decision-making bodies; partnerships between scientific public and private institutions; improved collaboration between natural and social scientists and establishing regular channels for requesting and receiving advice between scientists and policy makers; making greater use of integrated scientific assessments risk assessments and interdisciplinary and intersectoral approaches; increasing the beneficial use of local and indigenous knowledge. Strengthening and creating centres for sustainable development in developing countries were encouraged as well as networking with and between centres of scientific excellence and between science and education for sustainable development. Tools for science-based decision-making and sharing of knowledge and experiences to be promoted include: information and communication technologies ground-based observations satellite technologies and national statistical services capable of providing sound data assessment models accurate databases and integrated information systems. The Plan also urged support for publicly funded research and development entities to engage in strategic alliances for the purpose of enhancing research and development.
The special session of the General Assembly held in June 1997 to review progress five years after UNCED stressed the need for authoritative scientific evidence for assessing environmental conditions and changes which would facilitate international consensus-building. Scientific cooperation was to be promoted across disciplines for that purpose and building scientific and technological capacity in developing countries was extremely important in that regard.
Science for sustainable development is the focus of Chapter 35 of Agenda 21. It calls for:
strengthening the scientific basis for sustainable management;
enhancing scientific understanding;
improving long-term scientific assessment; and
building up scientific capacity and capability.

"Trade and Sustainable Development is addressed in Chapter 2 of Agenda 21 and in Chapter V and Chapter X of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
Trade liberalisation and globalisation can have both positive and negative effects on sustainable development. There is a continued need to support efforts by developing countries to integrate themselves into and derive benefits from the multilateral trading system. At the same time attention also must be given to enhancing the contribution of the multilateral trading system to sustainable development.
A supportive international economic environment is crucial. Agenda 21 calls for a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by:
promoting sustainable development through trade liberalisation;
making trade and environment mutually supportive;
providing adequate financial resources to developing countries dealing with international debt; and
encouraging macroeconomic policies conducive to environment and development.
Trade and sustainable development were discussed at the first second third fourth and fifth session of the Commission. Within the framework of the Commission's multi-year programme of work this issue was again discussed at the eighth session together with economic growth and investment as one of the major cross-sectoral themes.
The outcome of the Rio+20 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/rio20.html) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld) recognize that international trade plays a fundamental role in promoting sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth creating jobs raising incomes and enhancing welfare of peoples.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defines international trade as “an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction [that] contributes to the promotion of sustainable development”. The adoption of Agenda 2030 commits UN member states to continue to promote “meaningful” trade liberalization over the next 15 years to help maximize the contribution of trade to the success of the sustainable development agenda. In this context international trade is expected to play its role as a means of implementation for the achievement of the SDGs.
As major institutional stakeholders on trade and the SDGs issues UNCTAD  WTO and  International Trade Center monitor trends analyze policy and build analytical capacity for making international trade an engine for sustainable development.

"Our approach to capacity development
The Division’s capacity development activities advance the implementation of the2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development theSAMOA Pathwayand other internationally agreed development goals guided by the outcomes of United Nations intergovernmental bodies on the three pillars of sustainable development – social economic and environmental.
Capacity building activities are also aimed at strengthening and maintaining the capabilities of states and societies to design and implement strategies that minimize the negative impacts of current social economic and environmental crises and emerging challenges. As a cross-cutting entry point capacity building activities promote the integration of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs into national sustainable development planning frameworks sharing lessons learned and good practices through workshops and related events.
The Division’s activities also connect the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed development goals with selected sectoral areas among them sustainableenergywater and sanitationoceans and blue economyregions and citiesdisaster riskreductionscience and technologyand promotion of micro- small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

The 2030 Agenda and capacity-building
The 2030 Agenda recognizes that capacity-building forms part of the means of implementation for the SDGs (paragraph 41). Each SDG contains targets relating to means of implementation including capacity- building. Moreover SDG 17 which covers means of implementation and the global partnership for sustainable development contains target 17.9which aims to: Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals including through North-South South-South and triangular cooperation”.

Capacity-building: Historical context
Capacity-building has long been recognized as one of the means of implementation for the achievement of sustainable development. This is reflected in the outcome documents and action plans adopted by major international conferences on sustainable development.Agenda 21 adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development addresses capacity-building in its Chapter 37. Decisions relating to capacity-building were taken by the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development at itsfourth(1996)fifth(1997) andsixth(1998) sessions and by the United Nations General Assembly at itsSpecial Session to review the implementation of Agenda 21(1997). TheJohannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development also recognized the importance of capacity-building for the achievement of sustainable development. Similarly the outcome document of the Rio +20 Conference theFuture We Want emphasized the need for enhanced capacity-building for sustainable-development and for the strengthening of technical and scientific cooperation. In the context of small island developing states capacity- building is also recognized as a key issue in the 2014SAMOA Pathwayfor a wide range of areas such as climate change sustainable energy ocean sustainability management of chemicals and waste as well as financing.",ODS17
"Our approach to capacity development
The Division’s capacity development activities advance the implementation of the2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development theSAMOA Pathwayand other internationally agreed development goals guided by the outcomes of United Nations intergovernmental bodies on the three pillars of sustainable development – social economic and environmental.
Capacity building activities are also aimed at strengthening and maintaining the capabilities of states and societies to design and implement strategies that minimize the negative impacts of current social economic and environmental crises and emerging challenges. As a cross-cutting entry point capacity building activities promote the integration of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs into national sustainable development planning frameworks sharing lessons learned and good practices through workshops and related events.
The Division’s activities also connect the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed development goals with selected sectoral areas among them sustainableenergywater and sanitationoceans and blue economyregions and citiesdisaster riskreductionscience and technologyand promotion of micro- small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Activities seek to promote cross-cutting approaches and value of stakeholder engagement in planning and decision-making.

"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development states that the Sustainable Development Gaols (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic social and environmental). The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. Accordingly the integrated and interlinked nature of the SDGs needs to inform and guide their mainstreaming into national planning frameworks in the form of national development plans or sustainable development strategies. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda depends on such an integrated approach which involves identifying possible synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their associated targets as well as developing context specific integrated approaches to ensure effective implementation.
The 2019 SDG Summit called on countries to “mainstream the 2030 Agenda into our national planning instruments policies strategies and financial frameworks”. The voluntary national reviews (VNRs) and other sources provide examples of approaches taken by countries to integrate the 2030 agenda into national plans and strategies. Countries are also integrating regional and continental agendas into their plans for instance the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. The SDGs are also being incorporated into plans and review processes at the sub-national as evidenced by the voluntary local reviews.
The integration of the SDGs – and sustainable development more broadly – builds on the experience with National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) which were included in 1992 in Agenda 21 (§ 8.7). Here countries were called upon to integrate economic social and environmental objectives into one strategically focused blueprint for action at the national level. The NSDS “should be developed through the widest possible participation”. And it “should be based on a thorough assessment of the current situation and initiatives”.
As seen at the Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development issues such as country ownership and strong political commitment the integration of economic social and environmental objectives across sectors territories and generations; broad participation and effective partnerships the development of capacity and enabling environment as well as the mobilization of means of implementations remain at the centre of policy debates at all levels.
More on NSDS
In the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly (23-28 June 1997) member States reaffirmed the importance of NSDS and set a target of 2002 for the formulation and elaboration of NSDS that reflect the contributions and responsibilities of all interested parties.
However by 2002 based on national reports received from governments only about 85 countries had developed some form of national strategies and the nature and effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably from country to country. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) through paragraph 162 b recommitted member States to “take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development and to begin their implementation by 2005.”
During the preparatory process for the 2002 WSSD the International Forum on NSDS was held in Accra Ghana in 2001 which led to the launch of the Guidance in Preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy. It defined National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) as “a coordinated participatory and iterative process of thoughts and actions to achieve economic environmental and social objectives in a balanced and integrative manner”. Most importantly NSDS is a call for an institutional change. It aims at a transition from the traditional static putting-a-plan-on-paper exercise towards the establishment of an adaptive system that can continuously improve. It should be a process which “encompasses situation analysis formulation of policies and action plans implementation monitoring and regular review. It is a cyclical and interactive process of planning participation and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a ‘plan’ as an end product.”
Every country needs to determine for itself how best to approach the preparation and implementation of its national sustainable development strategy depending upon the prevailing political historical cultural ecological circumstances. A blueprint approach for national sustainable development strategies is neither possible nor desirable. The particular label applied to a national sustainable development strategy is not important as long as the underlying principles characterizing a national sustainable development strategy are adhered to and that economic social and environmental objectives are balanced and integrated.
Today there is an increased interest in national development planning and for many countries their national plan or strategy - even if not labelled as an NSDS - is the chief means for incorporating the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs into the national policy framework.

"Finance for sustainable development is the subject of Chapter 33 of Agenda 21 and Chapter X of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
Decisions on finance for sustainable development were taken by the Commission at its second third fourth sixth and eighth sessions and by the General Assembly at its nineteenth Special Session [Earth Summit + 5] in its Resolution S/19-2 on the Programme for the Future Implementation of Agenda 21. All decisions of the CSD after the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 had a section on finance in connection with the themes considered in those sessions (excluding CSD’s 11th session which defined the programme of work of the Commission).
Financing was addressed in paragraphs 253 to 268 of the outcome of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (20 - 22 June 2012) “The Future We Want”. Member States recognized “the need for significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources and the effective use of financing in order to give strong support to developing countries in their efforts to promote sustainable development including through actions undertaken in accordance with the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and for achieving sustainable development goals”.
The conference established an intergovernmental committee of experts and tasked it to prepare “a report proposing options on an effective sustainable development financing strategy to facilitate the mobilization of resources and their effective use in achieving sustainable development objectives”. The committee delivered its report in August 2014. The report informed the negotiations on the third international conference on financing for development held in July 2015 in Addis Ababa.
Financing is addressed in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development as part of the means of implementation under each of SDG 1-16 and under SDG 17. Paragraph 40 of the Summit outcome document “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” specifies the relationship between the actions and policies agreed in Addis Ababa and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and reads “The means of implementation targets under Goal 17 and under each Sustainable Development Goal are key to realizing our Agenda and are of equal importance with the other Goals and targets. The Agenda including the Sustainable Development Goals can be met within the framework of a revitalized Global Partnership for Sustainable Development supported by the concrete policies and actions as outlined in the outcome document of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development held in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July 2015. We welcome the endorsement by the General Assembly of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We recognize that the full implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is critical for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets”.
The newly established annual FfD Forum represents an important step forward in reinvigorating and strengthening the United Nations FfD follow-up process. The FfD Forum was established in accordance with paragraph 132 of the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda recognizing the need for a dedicated follow-up and review of the financing for development outcomes as well as the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The FfD Forum is held annually at the United Nations Headquarters in New York with universal intergovernmental participation. It results in intergovernmentally agreed conclusions and recommendations that are fed into the overall follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development.
The First Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) forum on financing for development follow-up (FfD forum) was held from 18 to 20 April 2016 in New York.
The Second Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) forum on financing for development follow-up (FfD forum) was held from 22 to 25 May 2017 in New York.

"Indicators in the Transforming Our World - The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
As stated in paragraph 75 of Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “the Goals and targets will be followed-up and reviewed using a set of global indicators. These will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by member states in addition to the outcomes of work undertaken for the development of the baselines for those targets where national and global baseline data does not yet exist”.
In order to identify a global indicator framework for the goals and targets the United Nations Statistical Commission gathered in March 2015 at its 46th Session and established an Inter-Agency Expert Group (IAEG) on SDG Indicators whose composition reflects equitable regional representation.
The group aims at ensuring technical expertise and assistance for the implementation of the indicators once approved and will be in charge of monitoring the use of harmonized and agreed indicators definitions as well as of reviewing methodological process and issues related to the indicators and their metadata.
In this context UN DESA's Statistics Division is organising the second meeting of the Inter-agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) to be held on 26-28 October 2015 at the United Nations Conference Center in Bangkok Thailand and hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). On this occasion the list of possible global indicators will be reviewed in detail whereas the global indicator framework together with the work plan and the next steps to be followed will be further discussed..
The proposal for Global Indicator Framework will be submitted for consideration by the Statistical Commission at its 47th Session in March 2016 and adopted thereafter by the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly in line with existing mandates.
Agenda 21
Chapter 40 of Agenda 21 called on countries and the international community to develop indicators of sustainable development. Such indicators were needed to increase focus on sustainable development and assist decision-makers at all levels to adopt sound national sustainable development policies.
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation & CSD-11 CSD-13
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation in its Chapter X and the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) at its 11th and 13th sessions encouraged further work on indicators for sustainable development by countries in line with their specific conditions and priorities. CSD-13 invited the international community to support efforts of developing countries in this regard.
Guidelines on Indicators & their Detailed Methodology Sheets
The third revised set of CSD indicators was finalized in 2006 by a group of experts from developing and developed countries and international organizations. The revised edition contained 96 indicators including a subset of 50 core indicators. The guidelines on indicators and their detailed methodology sheets became available as a reference for all countries to develop national indicators of sustainable development. The CSD indicator set was based on the previous two (1996 and 2001) editions which had been developed improved and extensively tested as part of the implementation of the Work Programme on Indicators of Sustainable Development adopted by the CSD at its third session in 1995 and presented to the CSD in 2001.

"The Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA) adopted in 1994 further complemented by The Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) of 2005 and MSI+5 Outcome document recognized that although they are afflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by development imperatives similar to those of developing countries generally small island developing States (SIDS) have their own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics. SIDS’ unique and particular vulnerabilities are highlighted in “The Future We Want” adopted at The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20) that took place in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in June 2012 - their small size remoteness narrow resource and export base and exposure to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks including to a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters (para 178). SIDS continue to address those structural and external challenges to achieve their sustainable development.
The Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia Samoa in September 2014 with the overarching theme of “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships”. Nearly 300 partnerships were announced at the conference and monitored through the Partnership Platform. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) adopted at the Conference addresses priority areas for SIDS and calls for urgent actions and support for SIDS’ efforts to achieve their sustainable development.
UN-DESA  leads inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system through the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs Plus (ECESA Plus) and among UN and non-UN entities active on SIDS issues through the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) on SIDS to monitor the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway as well as the progress being made in the SIDS partnerships. Moreover UN-DESA and particularly the SIDS Unit provides technical assistance and advice supports intergovernmental processes and reports on progress made in the implementation of the BPOA MSI and the Samoa Pathway.

"Technology science and capacity building are major pillars of the Means of Implementation of the Post-2015 Agenda and of the Rio+20 follow-up processes. The research development deployment and widespread diffusion of environmentally sound technologies in the context of a Green Economy is also closely linked to other core elements and means of implementation including innovation business opportunities and development trade of environmental goods and services finance and investment and institutional capabilities.
In order to eradicate poverty and reorient current unsustainable development trajectories over the period 2015 to 2030 affordable technological solutions have to be developed and disseminated widely in the next fifteen years. The Means of Implementation of the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda could nevertheless provide an opportunity to address some of the gaps hindering the facilitation and transfer of these technologies.
In 2012 the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (“Rio+20”) called for identifying technology facilitation mechanism. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda in its paragraph 123 decided to establish a technology facilitation mechanism. The mechanism will be launched at the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in order to support the sustainable development goals.
