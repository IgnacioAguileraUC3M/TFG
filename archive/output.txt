The impact of climate change has been alarming for the crop growth. The extreme weather conditions can stress the crops and reduce the yield of major crops belonging to Poaceae family too, that sustains 50% of the world’s food calorie and 20% of protein intake. Computational approaches, such as artificial intelligence-based techniques have become the forefront of prediction-based data interpretation and plant stress responses. In this study, we proposed a novel activation function, namely, Gaussian Error Linear Unit with Sigmoid (SIELU) which was implemented in the development of a Deep Learning (DL) model along with other hyper parameters for classification of unknown abiotic stress protein sequences from crops of Poaceae family. To develop this models, data pertaining to four different abiotic stress (namely, cold, drought, heat and salinity) responsive proteins of the crops belonging to poaceae family were retrieved from public domain. It was observed that efficiency of the DL models with our proposed novel SIELU activation function outperformed the models as compared to GeLU activation function, SVM and RF with 95.11%, 80.78%, 94.97%, and 81.69% accuracy for cold, drought, heat and salinity, respectively. Also, a web-based tool, named DeepAProt (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5500/) was developed using flask API, along with its mobile app. This server/App will provide researchers a convenient tool, which is rapid and economical in identification of proteins for abiotic stress management in crops Poaceae family, in endeavour of higher production for food security and combating hunger, ensuring UN SDG goal 2.0.

The marine environment represents an important resource for the promotion of sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, highlights the need to balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions when using the World's oceans. However, trade-offs arise between the implementation of SDG goals and the well-being of different groups of people. The use of justice mechanisms is critical for achieving social equity outcomes from ocean use. Trade-offs in implementation between SDG14 and other SDGs in the Seychelles are examined through the lens of distributive and procedural justice. Content analysis of grey and policy literature and qualitative data derived from stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions are used to examine trade-offs between expanding marine protection through the Blue Economy initiative and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and the livelihoods and well-being of artisanal fishers. MSP limit fishers’ access to marine resources through spatial, temporal, and permanent prohibitions on access to key fishing areas and gear use that negatively impact upon food security, subsistence livelihoods and well-being. These trade-offs reduce capacity to attain other SDG goals linked to alleviating poverty, hunger and good health and well-being. Consultation processes, by not giving adequate voice to fishers concerns and local knowledge, raise issues of procedural fairness. Trade-offs are largely borne by weaker socio-economic groups, leading to a failure to address issues of distributive fairness. Our research shows that the promotion of sustainable futures in the Seychelles remains elusive unless matters in relation to distributive justice are addressed and procedural fairness is provided. How justice mechanisms can be used in pursuit of social equity from ocean use is explained, and avenues for further research outlined. © 2022 The Authors

Background: United Nations SDG-2 and SDG-3 pledges to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and reduce premature deaths of children persisting amongst 821 million people globally. Chickpeas, the second largest food legume in the world, are important due to dietary, therapeutic and health values since Roman times and are ideal source of protein, carbohydrate, minerals and β-carotene. Therefore, it is central to alleviate malnutrition and ensuring good health. Methods: We conducted experiments during Rabi crop season 2018-19 and 2019-20 and studied proximate nutritional compositions such as protein, its bioavailability enhancement procedures, optimum sprouting stage and potential genotypes. The present series experiment as 6th one was undertaken to find out the impacts of varying seed seedlings germination stages at 0, 3 and 6 days on observed estimates of protein contents in 12 potential genotypes of chickpea including Pusa-256 as standard (control) check. Result: We noticed erosion of reserved seed nutrients activating seedling growth and enhancing nutritional values, observed protein in the range of 18.96 to 28.69%, discovered 6 days sprouts giving highest digestible protein and identified genotypes BG-1092, ICC-11378, JG-74 as potential resources to be utilized in breeding programmes for harnessing their genetic potentials for enriching protein and other nutritional components. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

Due to their highly perishable characteristics, vegetables have the highest levels of losses in the post-harvest phase. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defines SDG 12, which seeks to ensure sustainable production and consumption patterns, and to reduce by half the per capita food waste in the world, in addition to reducing food losses throughout the entire production chain and supplies. Improving the production chain for these products plays an important role in health, food safety and the fight against hunger. In this sense, this study aims to investigate anti-loss practices in the post-harvest phase in a vegetable supply chain in a municipality in the interior of São Paulo, given the importance of family farming in Brazil and the urgency to reduce food losses. The methodology used was qualitative research, with literature and document review, using the single case study method, carried out with a family farmer, and a questionnaire to collect primary data on the subject. Among the results obtained, it was found that the anti-loss actions carried out in the chain come from the main member (producer), who constantly requests greater attention regarding the way in which the products are presented to the consumer, harvesting as close as possible to the time of delivery to the markets, and collaboration with partners regarding the delivery of quantities according to what is absorbed by the market, avoiding losses in cold chambers. © 2022 University Center of Maringa.

Food production for human consumption is a leading cause of environmental damage in the world and yet over two billion people suffer from malnutrition. Several studies have presented evidence that changes in dietary patterns across the world can lead to win-win outcomes for environmental and social sustainability and can complement ongoing technological and policy efforts to improve the efficiency of agricultural production. However, the existing evidence have been compiled in “silos” by a large range of researchers across several disciplines using different indicators. The aim of this quantitative review is to bring together the existing knowledge on heterogeneity of current dietary patterns across the world and how a transition toward healthy diets in different countries can aid in progress toward multiple global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We first summarize the nutritional quality, economic cost, and environmental footprint of current diets of over 150 countries using multiple indicators. Next, we review which shifts in dietary patterns across different world regions can help toward achievement of SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and wellbeing), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG13 (Climate action), SDG14 (Life below water), and SDG15 (Life on land). Finally, we briefly discuss how to enable the shift toward sustainable dietary patterns and identify the research and data gaps that need to be filled through future efforts. Our analysis reveals that dietary change is necessary in all countries as each one has unique priorities and action items. For regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, increased intake of nutrient dense foods is needed to address deficiency of essential nutrients like folate, potassium, and vitamin A. For North America and Europe, shifting toward more plant-based diets would be healthier and simultaneously reduce the per capita environmental footprints. The results can be useful for policymakers in designing country-specific strategies for adoption of sustainable dietary behaviors and for food industry to ensure the supply of sustainable food items customized with regions' need.

The state of food security in the world, including that of Europe and Central Asia (ECA), was highlighted in 2020 by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the fact that the food security status of millions of people in ECA, particularly the most vulnerable and those living in fragile contexts, would deteriorate if swift action was not taken as soon as possible became apparent. Improving cereal yield is the key for the ECA to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 2.1 to end hunger by 2030. Impressive cereal yield growth has been witnessed within the ECA from 1991 to 2020, but there is still significant variation across the five sub-regions. This paper aimed to analyze the evolutionary trends and convergence of cereal yield in countries of the ECA from 1991 to 2020 for four major cereals: wheat, maize, barley and oats. The findings show that there is strong evidence of σ-convergence and absolute and conditional β-convergence for cereal yield in the ECA, which indicates that countries with low yield in the initial stages have totally experienced higher growth rate, and yield in countries farther away from the steady-state have to have faster growth rate to converge to the steady-state. The presence of club convergence is also identified in terms of geographic location and income level, simultaneously. Therefore, cereal yield in the ECA has converged to the whole and to different groups at the same time, which provides some evidence of agricultural technology spillover effect in the region. © 2022 by the authors.

Women contribute decisively to the economy and have an important participation in agricultural exploitation in the world, providing their labor. But if they had better access to technology and training in a more equitable way, they could contribute much more. In effect, the rapid technological changes that have occurred in the sector pose an even greater challenge to achieve equalizing the role of women to that of men in the agri-food sector. The limitation of the female gender to training and empowerment prevents them from taking advantage of the technology that are contributing to the achievement of a world free of hunger and malnutrition, which is one of the sustainable development goals (SDG). Therefore, this work analyzes the world situation in terms of training and gender gaps to see if these elements affect the achievement of four of the sustainable development goals (SDG 2, 4, 5 10) in 87 countries. The results of the multiple linear regression show the existence of a positive relationship between these elements is demonstrated. Then, as a real example, Spain is chosen as a country reference and analyzed in terms of training by gender, digital gender gap and labor gap. Finally, some advice and recommendations that allow the achievement of the inclusion of women in the improvement of the countries are suggested. © 2022, Bononia University Press. All rights reserved.

This study developed a marginal abatement cost curve to identify a mix of least-cost investment options with the highest potential for hunger reduction, hunger here defined by the undernourishment concept of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Twenty-two different interventions are considered for reducing undernourishment relying on information drawn from best available evidence-based literature, including model- and large-scale intervention studies. Ending hunger by 2030 would require annual investments of about US$ 39 to 50 billion until 2030 to lift about 840 to 909 million people out of hunger, which is the 2020 estimate of hunger projection in 2030, also considering the effects of COVID-19. Investing in agricultural R&D, agricultural extension services, ICT - Agricultural information systems, small-scale irrigation expansion in Africa and female literacy improvement are low cost options that have a relatively large hunger-reduction potential. To achieve the goal of ending hunger by 2030, not only is it urgent not to lose any more time, but also to optimally phase investments. Investments that have more long-term impacts should be frontloaded in the decade in order to reap their benefits soon before 2030. A balanced approach is needed to reach the hungry soon – including those adversely affected by COVID-19 with social protection and nutrition programs. © 2021 The Authors

Sustainable development has become a central and key goal for humanity (1 UN: Millenium Development Goals, 2 SDGs). There is no scientific or political consensus, however, about the root cause of unsustainability, so an effective cure is impossible. Nevertheless, unlimited inequality among nations and individuals, extreme poverty, and hunger are always among the most significant problems. It is also often claimed that the world’s current food production would be sufficient to feed all 7.7 billion people on Earth (see Appendix A 1) with a better (more even, ‘just’) distribution. Others use food hunger and poverty data to support claims for increased food production and agricultural output. In this paper we examine the first claim with real data, but from a theoretical perspective: is it true, theoretically, that if all of the produced and wasted food were made available to feed the extremely poor and hungry, we could reach zero hunger-related deaths? We will use food waste, hunger-related (+thirst) death, obesity, and calorie consumption data from the “happy” and “unhappy” parts of the Earth. The cause of food waste is dissonant in different economic systems, so its macro-and microeconomic approach is also completely different in different countries. The relationship between obesity, hunger, and food waste has not yet been explored in a structured framework; data are available but scattered. In this paper we propose a unified framework of comparable data as a first step in mapping the biggest missing, or at least wobbling circle of modern bio-economy: global food supply. Thinking globally is a first step toward progress development in food justice and a solution to UN sustainable development goals (SDG 2, 1, 3, and 10). © 2021 by the authors.

Being critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, strengthening understanding of the properties and processes of soil at national and regional scales is imperative. The necessity to realize SDGs by 2030 also inspires a greater sense of responsibility and care for soils. Sustainable management of soil health is important to achieving several SDGs. Pertinent SDGs intricately connected with soil health include SDG 1 (End Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 5 (Gender Equality), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land). Some of these SDGs rely considerably on plant production and others depend on soil processes. Pertinent among soil processes are water movement, heat transfer, sorption and physical filtration, ion exchange, and biochemical and biophysical transformations. In terms of specific accomplishments, 130 countries have aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge, the globally available fresh water has decreased to 71% of needs, Technosols (soils whose formation is influenced by anthropogenic based materials) are used in urban ecosystems, food wastes are composted, specific targets of Land Degradation Neutrality have been signed by several countries, and soil C sequestration targets are widely implemented through initiatives such as the 4 Per Thousand (4P1000) initiative, Platform on Climate Action in Americas (PLACA), Adapting African Agriculture (AAA), Living Soils of the Americas (LiSAM), etc. In addition, policy and regulatory frameworks being widely promoted by several U.N. agencies (e.g., U.N. SDGs,limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2 °C) can be supported by innovations in soil science including forensic soil science, remote sensing and other innovations. Soil health is becoming a central element of the research and innovation program of the EU, aiming to reach a 75% of healthy soils by 2030. In addition, the importance of soil health to human health and environmental issues is being widely promoted through educational books on soil science and secondary schools, as well as the revision of curricula. With continuous progress in movement into the digital world, transfer and communication of knowledge of the soil sciences can improve for the end users, policymakers, and the general public but additional efforts are needed. Soil science knowledge and research forms a significant contribution to specific aspects of food and nutritional security, human wellbeing, nature conservancy, and global peace and harmony. Achieving critical SDGs by 2030 can be facilitated by soil restoration and sustainable management. © 2021

This is the first review to examine progress and barriers towards achieving food security in Melanesia as defined by United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger and its component targets. Globally, Indigenous Peoples makeup ~5% of the global population and are responsible for protecting ~80% of the world's biodiversity. Indigenous Melanesians live within one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, however our findings suggest that traditional agrobiodiversity and food system knowledge are being lost to urbanization, lifestyle changes, imported foods, and deforestation. While progress has been made in reducing stunting and wasting, considerable efforts are still required to reverse the rising rates of NCDs and achieve food security in Melanesia. Future strategies should focus on promoting nutrition education, improved education for women, increasing agrobiodiversity within food systems, sustainable seafood production, diversification of protein sources, equitable market opportunities, and crafting trade agreements with insights from public health professionals to encourage health over profits. Strong participatory strategies inclusive of traditional knowledge are essential if Melanesia aims to progress towards the targets outlined in SDG 2: Zero Hunger. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Target 2.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) calls to end hunger in all its forms by 2030. Measuring food security among children under age 15, who represent a quarter of the world's population, remains a challenge and is infeasible for global monitoring. The SDG framework has agreed to use the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) to measure moderate and severe food insecurity. Using nationally-representative data from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) survey in 2014–15, we provide the first global and regional estimates of food insecurity among households with children under age 15. In addition, we test the robustness of the FIES against 1) monetary poverty and 2) the Negative Experience Index, a measure of well-being. Finally, we explore trends in per capita income as a determinant of food security (2006–15) to observe how this relationship fluctuated during the Great Recession. We find that across 147 countries and four territories, 41% of households with children under age 15 suffer from moderate or severe food insecurity, 19% from severe food insecurity, and 45% reported not having enough money to buy food in the previous 12 months. The relationship between food insecurity, poverty, and well-being varies by region, demonstrating that definitions of food insecurity depend on regional context, and encompass more than monetary poverty alone. Our findings will ideally encourage and provide motivation for continued global efforts to address food insecurity and monitor progress towards SDGs. © 2020

Fisheries play a significant role in the livelihoods of the world population, while the dependence on fisheries is acute in developing countries. Fisheries are consequently a critical element for meeting the sustainable development (SDG) and FAO goals to reduce poverty, hunger and improve health and well-being. However, 90% of global marine fish stocks are fully or overexploited. The amount of biologically unsustainable stocks increased from 10% in 1975 to 33% in 2015. Freshwater ecosystems are the most endangered ecosystems and freshwater fish stocks are worldwide in a state of crisis. The continuous fish stock decline indicates that the world is still far from achieving SDG 14 (Life Below Water), FAO’s Blue Growth Initiative goal and SDG 15 (Life on Land, including freshwater systems). Failure to effectively manage world fish stocks can have disastrous effects on biodiversity and the livelihoods and socio-economic conditions of millions of people. Therefore, management strategies that successfully conserve the stocks and provide optimal sustainable yields are urgently needed. However, successful management is only possible when the necessary data are obtained and decision-makers are well informed. The main problem for the management of fisheries, particularly in developing countries, is the lack of information on the past and current status of the fish stocks. Sound data collection and validation methods are, therefore, important. Stock assessment models, which support sustainable fisheries, require life history traits as input parameters. In order to provide accurate estimates of these life history traits, standardized methods for otolith preparation and validation of the rate of growth zone deposition are essential. This review aims to assist researchers and fisheries managers, working on marine and freshwater fish species, in understanding concepts and processes related to stock assessment and population dynamics. Although most examples and case studies originate from developing countries in the African continent, the review remains of great value to many other countries. © 2021 by the authors.

With ever-increasing population of the world, which has now reached 7.75 billion, it has become a major challenge for world to meet the sustainable development goal (SDG) of zero hunger via meeting demand for food, feed, and other agricultural products especially in developing countries. Therefore, improving and sustaining agricultural crops yield without posing negative impact on environment should be the ultimate goal to meet food and nutritional requirement around the world. Application of chemical fertilizers although has increased the crop productivity but simultaneously has posed serious threat to human and environmental health. Therefore, biofertilizers from microorganisms have potential to replace these chemical fertilizers in sustaining agricultural productivity and maintaining environmental health. Moreover biofertilizers are easy to use and less expensive than chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers includes one or more beneficial microbes that facilitate better nutrient uptake, greater production of growth hormone and beneficial phytochemicals in crops leading to higher quantity as well quality crop production. Nitrogen-fixing microbes, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), sulfur-solubilizing bacteria (SSB), potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB), and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) etc. are already being utilized in combination for making biofertilizers formulations for enhancing crop production but on small scale. Thus, large scale exploitation of agriculturally important microbes for sustaining agricultural productivity is the need of the hour. This chapter highlights the types, quality control measures, inoculation techniques of microbial biofertilizers; their role in sustaining agricultural productionand challenges as well as ways forward to promote the use of biofertilizers in order to achieve sustainable agricultural production to meet out the SDG of zero hunger. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The natural world has multiple, sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic, values to society when viewed through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Spatial mapping of nature's contributions to the SDGs has the potential to support the implementation of SDG strategies through sustainable land management and conservation of ecosystem services. Such mapping requires a range of spatial data. This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature's contribution to targets under SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture. We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, population, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint, we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger). Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature's contribution to SDG 6, such as the protection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure. We provide a freely available tool, within the Co$tingNature platform, based on a variety of remotely sensed products, that can be used by SDG practitioners to carry out similar analyses and inform decision-making at national or sub-national levels globally. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In his 1941 State of the Union address, Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated four fundamental freedoms that people "everywhere in the world"should enjoy - of speech and of worship, and from fear and from want. Food ("freedom from want") is a fundamental human right, and it is acknowledged that there is enough sustenance in the world to feed everyone. Yet, some 800 million people are hungry. Why? It is due to a combination of inequitable distribution and morally indefensible destruction of excess crops to keep market prices attractive for producers and "big-agro"industry. In addition, one third of food is lost or wasted from "farm to fork."The world financial and food crisis in 2008 led to an additional short-term dimension to food security - stability. Sustainability may be regarded as the long-term time element combining environmental protection, sociocultural, and economic development. To emphasize the interrelations between economics and sustainable diets, the first two of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are: (1) No Poverty and (2) Zero Hunger. Every country has marginalized populations with food insecurity, aggravated by natural and man-made disasters and whose numbers are always underestimates. We have developed a Global Nutrition Index to track the triple burden of malnutrition and it seems that the problems of obesity and the food industry are even greater than those of hunger. However, there is an essential difference: while people never choose to be hungry, there are elements of socioeconomic inequalities, personal choice, and parental responsibility in the development of obesity, especially in children. Nutrition, economics, and education are essential for improving human capital and come together in SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being - since "a well-fed nation is a healthy nation is a productive and sustainable nation." © 2020 S.

The international community has adopted and endorsed an ambitious global development agenda for the period 2015–2030 in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. This reflects a broad international consensus on the unacceptability of hunger articulated previously at the 1996 World Food Summit and reiterated at the 2008 High-Level Conference on World Food Security. In 2009, at their L’Aquila Summit, the G8 heads of state and government pledged a significant expansion of aid to agriculture, in order to address the global food-price spike of the preceding year. However, serious global policy incoherence severely undermines this apparent political will to end hunger and boost developing-country agriculture. In particular, although official development assistance to agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (hunger’s center of gravity) doubled between 2003 and 2012, the share of total global aid going to agriculture, at just 5% in 2014, is well below the 20% share of the mid-1980s. In addition, donor-country agricultural trade and security policies often undercut support for agricultural development in the Global South. Furthermore, there is incoherence within donor policies on aid to agriculture, which tend to focus more on promoting commercialization and exports than on boosting smallholder productivity and the economic empowerment of women farmers. For their part, developing-country governments have not fulfilled pledges to increase their own agricultural development budgets (as seen in the African Union Declarations of Maputo and Malabo), and the bulk of those budgets go to recurrent expenditure rather than development investments. In Sub-Saharan Africa, military expenditures account for a greater share of public funds. This paper suggests that while policy makers in both the Global South and North treat food security and agricultural development as priorities, these remain in a relatively low position on policy agendas because other concerns respond to much stronger constituencies. © 2019, The Author(s).

In a world of 9 billion people and a widening income gap between the rich and poor, it is time to rethink how aquaculture can strengthen its contribution to the second UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger in our generation. The disparity in the level of sustainable aquaculture development at present, between and within countries, especially regarding human access to farmed aquatic food remains highly variable across the globe. This paper offers a fresh look at the opportunities from using systems thinking and new open innovation measuring tools to grow sustainable aquaculture. Political will in many nations is the main constraint to aquaculture in realising its potential as an: accessible source of micronutrients and nutritious protein; aid to meeting conservation goals; economic prosperity generator where benefits extend to locals and provider of indirect social benefits such as access to education and well-being, among others. Resources to enable strong partnerships (SDG 17) between academia, civic society, government and industry should be prioritised by governments to build a sustainable aquatic food system, accessible to all, forever. © 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

The world has made strides in reducing hunger and protein malnutrition but considerable progress is required to reduce micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) malnutrition, which is estimated to affect the health of up to two billion people. This need is recognized in UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) – “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”. To this end, research and development institutions such as the Global Horticultural Initiative (GHI) and the World Vegetable Center have embraced the concept of Horticulture for Sustainable Development (H4sD) with the aim of reducing micronutrient deficiency through the increased production and consumption of fruit and vegetables. Increased fruit and vegetable production brings many other benefits to people, such as enhanced income for smallholder farmers and other value chain participants, employment opportunities throughout the value chain, empowerment of women, and more sustainable agriculture when it is incorporated as part of an agricultural diversification program. Thus, fruit and vegetable horticulture has great potential to contribute directly to several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 12 (“Responsible consumption and production”). This paper showcases recent evidence for the impact of international vegetable research and development done by the World Vegetable Center in collaboration with its partners, notably those in the GHI and in the public and private sectors. It highlights the impact of three major areas of the Center’s work: breeding improved lines of globally important and traditional niche vegetables; developing improved production technologies, such as those aimed at off-season vegetable production; and training poor rural women in household gardening and nutrition. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and priorities for increasing the medium and long-term impact of international vegetable research and development.

Combatting malnutrition in all its forms-undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, and obesity-is one of the greatest challenges that countries are facing. Much has happened in less than 10 years to redefine the international nutrition landscape and place nutrition at the heart of global development efforts. The food crises of 2008 and the Lancet first series on maternal and child undernutrition helped galvanize world attention. The enormous health and economic consequences of malnutrition were recognized, and far more attention began to be paid to the multiple burdens of malnutrition. In 2014, the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) endorsed 2 outcome documents, committing world leaders to establishing national policies aimed at eliminating malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger, and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. In 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global objectives to guide the actions of the international community over the next 15 years (2016-2030). Member States placed high priority on addressing malnutrition in all its forms by committing, under SDG 2, to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." However, nutrition has also a role to play in achieving other goals of the 2030 Agenda, including goals related to poverty, health, education, social protection, gender, water, work, growth, inequality, and climate change. In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the ICN2 outcome documents and proclaimed the years 2016-2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Nutrition Decade reaffirmed the commitments under the ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda to end malnutrition in all its forms. Together, the ICN2, the 2030 Agenda, and the Nutrition Decade have placed nutrition firmly at the heart of the development agenda with the recognition that transformed food systems have a fundamental role to play in promoting healthy diets and improving nutrition. This paper reviews the major international nutrition system changes called for, and provides an analysis of recent governance initiatives to address malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger problems. © 2018 FAO.

Having enough and sufficiently nutritious food is an inalienable human right. Every child, every woman, and every man has the right to live on healthy, diverse, and affordable food. It is the premise of a healthy, productive, and self-determined life. Yet, there are not only 800 million people going to bed hungry every day, there are also 2 billion people who suffer from hidden hunger, lacking valuable micronutrients like vitamins, zinc, or iron. They are more often ill, too weak to work in the fields, or to go to school. Of these, 80% of the people live in rural areas, 26% of children under 5 years are stunted, and 3 million children die every year as a consequence of hidden hunger. The causes of hidden hunger are as diverse as the consequences: Cultivating monocultures depletes soils of nutrients and people in poverty want to fill their stomachs before they worry about a balanced diet. The quality of food is subordinated to its quantity and many women and men never learn about the importance of healthy nutrition or their right to it. This shows the challenges that are posed for sustainable development and, thus, for international development cooperation. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) take up these challenges and provide a framework for tackling them. Although SDG 2 "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" is the most prominent goal in relation to hidden hunger, most of the other goals are related to it as they are either a prerequisite or an outcome of the action against hidden hunger. In its strategic framework, Bread for the World sets out different focal sectors, all of which tackle, either directly or indirectly, causes and consequences of hidden hunger. One of the sectors addresses sustainable agriculture and rural development, where projects are implemented by partner organizations worldwide and concern not just the quantity, but also and especially the quality of food. Yet, the majority of incoming funding requests are not concerned with hidden hunger directly. Yet a variety of project approaches consider influencing factors for hidden hunger. Additionally, every 3 years, Bread for the World chooses a motto under which it engages deeply with a certain topic in diverse ways. From 2014 to 2017, this motto is "Sated is not enough!". This approach allows attention to be directed to the phenomenon of hidden hunger in all its dimensions and helps to contribute to the solution of that global challenge with the international community. © 2018 S.

Land has gained stature as a natural resource to be protected since the 2012 Rio+20 Summit. The decision to "strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world in the context of sustainable development" (United Nations 2012, p. 54), along with the understanding that "this should act to catalyze financial resources from a range of public and private sources," served as the foundation for further discussions about land. In 2015, land was included in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development as target 15.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15). Land has been defined as a global strategic resource that is under stress due to rapidly growing demand for biomass production to accommodate increased food and energy consumption and population dynamics. More than half of the additional two billion people who will live on Earth by 2050 will be born in Africa. The population of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is predicted to grow from 900 million to about 1.4 billion by 2030. However, the region leads the world in poverty, hunger and food insecurity, youth unemployment, agricultural vulnerability to climate change, land degradation, resource-based conflicts, and migrations leading to economic, social, and political instability. Africa has the resources to respond to the exploding global demand for food, energy, and water. The region accounts for 60 % of the world’s uncultivated arable land and more than one third (715 million ha) of the world’s degraded land with potential for restoration. It is already a global hotspot for successful land restoration projects due to innovations in technology and social engineering, which mostly occur at a local level. The institutional aspects relating to the establishment, management and support of restoration projects, however, are one of the major obstacles to scaling up these projects. Achieving land degradation neutrality will be key for the economic, social, and environmental transformations SSA needs to accomplish, given the challenges and potentials of the region, such as climate change, population dynamics, and globalization. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.
