This is complicated by gradually decreasing productivity and acreage as a result of climate change in addition to ever-increasing input costs of resource hungry staple crops like rice, wheat, and maize. Unfortunately, the most affected by these events are those who have the least resources at their disposal to mitigate the issue, especially in countries of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is therefore pertinent to explore and adopt alternative and/or complementary crops that are easier to cultivate, climate change tolerant, less resource hungry, nutritionally richer for human consumption, and agriculturally sustainable. Millets are perfect cereal crops which meet all of these requirements and can realistically provide much-needed solutions to current global food and nutritional security challenges. In this review, we provide a bird’s eye view of the relevance of millets in global agro-ecosystems in the context of their nutritional and agronomic attributes. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the major areas of crop improvement programs worldwide and discuss major challenges confronting the same. Finally, we discourse on the scope of millets for wider acceptability and highlight major points at the interface of genetic intervention–crop management post-harvest practices worth considering to potentially facilitate robust millet-based nutritional and food security. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo."

It is also essential for accomplishing many of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG) such as SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), and SDG15 (life on land). However, without proper management, irrigation development can cause twin hydrological problems, i.e., rising groundwater level and salinization in irrigated regions. Long-term groundwater recharge estimation is essential for managing the above-mentioned problems of irrigated regions. This study formulated and employed a simple groundwater recharge model, which is a combination of the groundwater budget and seasonal groundwater level fluctuations. Estimated long-term (44 years, from 1976 to 2020) seasonal groundwater recharge was analyzed to appraise the twin hydrological problems of a study area in northwest India. The investigation is the first in the study region; it is simple to follow and it can be replicated in other regions of the world dealing with comparative issues. The analysis disclosed that the developed model performed very well in estimating groundwater recharge. This was verified statistically by high R-squared (0.987) and model efficiency (0.940) values and low mean error (0.011 m) and root-mean-square error (0.089 m) values. Analysis of various components of groundwater recharge revealed that more than 60% of the mean monsoonal recharge was provided by percolation alone due to the high paddy field portion. Higher average seasonal tubewell draft in the winter season always resulted in negative net recharge. However, yearly net recharge was consistently positive on account of higher monsoonal recharge. Consequently, the aquifer level rose at a mean rate of about 0.12 m annually throughout the study period. Because the groundwater level was already high, an additional rise would worsen the condition. Alternative management plans must be developed and realized for sustainable resource management in the region. As a follow-up action, three possible scenarios were investigated by using the model. The analysis of the scenarios disclosed that conjunctive water utilization needed to be increased for crop irrigation, which aids more groundwater withdrawal from the area. The other scenario suggested altered cropping with the reduced paddy cultivation because the paddy field contributed un-proportionately high recharge in the overall water balance of the region. The analysis suggested that implementing a combination of more than one change altogether would be more beneficial as compared to individual changes in baseline inputs. For example, altered cropping along with conjunctive water utilization would deliver more favorable results. The strategies described here are reliable in encouraging stakeholders/farmers to realize long-term sustainable goals. © 2021, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences."

This research aimed to develop a quantitative-collaborative methodology for constructing indicators and indexes for the sustainability of the Cerrado and Caatinga Brazilian biomes, considering the connection and synergies between the Nexus perspective and the 2030 Agenda’s SDG–target framework. The study was applied in 2,512 municipalities that make up the total of the mentioned biomes. The methodology consists of four major blocks: i) identification and construction of indicators based on the association of them with one or more 2030 Agenda’s targets, in a collaborative way from expert groups; ii) generation of weights by an indicator considering leverage, according to the number of target assignments, and importance, attributed by experts for each indicator to the target; iii) generation of sustainable development goal indexes, considering the performance of the SDGs; Nexus performance, considering different weights between the SDGs; Nexus synergistic, the standard deviation between the SDGs; and Nexus overall, a combination of the last two; and iv) sensitivity analysis for performance indexes considering the assignment of zero values to the governance indicators. In general, the regions of MATOPIBA, northern and western of Cerrado and the Caatinga, are, on average, the areas of greatest vulnerability. The targets that respond to this inequality are related to eradicating hunger, sustainable and climate-resilient production systems, universal access to water, water quality, efficiency of multiple water uses, access to energy, and the participation of renewable energies. We found that in areas of better average nexus performance, there is also greater inequality between nexus dimensions; therefore, the Nexus overall index is penalized. The federal units and areas with the worst Nexus dimension performances and with insufficient governance measures are north and northwest of Bahia and municipalities bordering the State of Tocantins—food; Maranhão and Piauí, northeast of Mato Grosso, northwest of Goiás, Rio Grande do Norte and Paraíba—water; and Maranhão, extreme southeast of Pará, and more sparsely in Paraíba—energy.

The study applies the system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) on a panel data of 15 West African countries for the period 2005–2018. The result from system GMM shows that innovation and social inclusion are drivers of food security. The implication of this is that increased level of social inclusion and innovation in West African may increase the level of food security by about 41.5% and 13.6% respectively. Therefore, the study concludes that to feed the growing African population, social inclusion should be improved to mitigate risk, vulnerability and socioeconomic shocks faced by farming households. In addition, innovation in agricultural should be enhanced to drive productivity, thereby leading to a sustainable food security. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzer-land."

When considering the truth that the Mediterranean Basin is the region that has been challenged by climate change and invasive alien species much more than others in the world, food insecurity is the most critical issue. As achieving food security, Mediterranean countries should keep the balance between the population and food sources in the related region. Accordingly, determining indicators and variables guiding policy makers to develop sustainable strategies for food security will be important cases for researchers. This study aims to review the sustainability level of the agricultural food market among Mediterranean countries. It is thought to give a holistic view for agricultural food markets in the Mediterranean Basin. This study focuses on examining some selected indicators for agricultural food markets among Mediterranean countries by showing recent descriptive statistics for agricultural products as crops and cereals. © 2022, IGI Global.

Food insecurity is still a persistent problem globally because of how food and farming sector is currently organized vs. how it should be organized if cultural traditions, environmental concerns, and nutritional needs of the world's growing population were foregrounded. The article argues that system-wide transformations are needed at different scales: landscape (macro), species (meso) and genes (micro). It suggests alternatives available for food and farming sector and identifies transformative pathways that are more sustainable in cultural, social and environmental terms. A better management of farming landscapes; diversification of the food system to include a wider range of species; and better use of neglected and underutilized species, varieties and cultivars of plants, and breeds of animals, in the food system can help to catalyze such a transformation. This can go a long way in promoting global sustainability by achieving three key UN Sustainable Development Goals: 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) and 15 (Life on Land).

In addition, rising greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change are placing a significant strain on the planet’s ability to sustain itself. However, in order to increase the quantity of proteins of plant origin, it is necessary to increase crop production areas, harvesting frequencies and the quantity of crops produced. Unfortunately, the optimization of these factors is already very close to the available maximum in the current situation. The developed cultivation systems and maximum utilization of the soil power leads to very serious environmental problems, soil destruction, loss of biodiversity and serious environmental pollution through the transport of the produced plant raw materials. This poses a serious challenge to food security and further increases the risk of hunger. There is therefore a need for agricultural practices that can lead to the cultivation of food and feed crops that have better sustainability indicators and are more resilient to climate change, which can be used to safely produce health-promoting feeds, as well as novel and value-added foods. Within this group, a particular problem is presented by the protein supply of the population, as currently about one billion people do not have adequate protein intake. However, conventional protein sources are not sufficient to meet growing protein needs. As mentioned above, food and feed proteins are based on plant proteins. In recent years, a prominent role has been played by the research into alternative proteins and the mapping of their positive and negative properties. Among alternative proteins, special attention has been paid to various yeasts, fungi, bacteria, algae, singe cell proteins (SCPs) and insects. In this paper, we focus on the presentation of algae, particularly microalgae, which are of paramount importance not only because of their significant protein content and favorable amino acid composition, but also because they are also sources of many valuable molecules, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, pigments, antioxidants, drugs and other biologically active compounds. It is important to learn about microalgae biomass in order to be able to develop innovative health food products. © 2021, Wessling International Research and Educational Centre Nonprofit Beneficial Ltd..

Going beyond these direct tangible/objective benefits from urban agriculture, in this paper we ask: How can growing food in the cities teach us about taking care of each other and the natural environment? We use the example of urban food autonomy movements to discuss the transformative potential of a grassroots-led initiative promoting permaculture, which is anchored in three “ethics”: care for the earth, care for the people, and fair share. Through examining the philosophical underpinnings of “autonomy” and “care”, we explore how urban food autonomy initiatives can enable the development of an ethics of care, especially using permaculture inspirations. Our theoretical review and case analysis reveal that “autonomy” can never be achieved without “care” and that these are co-dependent outcomes. The urban food autonomy initiatives are directly relevant for the achievement of the three of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals: “Zero Hunger,” “Life on Land” and “Climate Action”, and contribute to a culture of care. Indeed, urban agriculture can act as a powerful education platform for the engagement of diverse stakeholders while also supporting a collective transformation of values. © 2021 by the author."

Although numerous attempts have been made to secure resilience in the food system, many countries are suffering from hunger and malnutrition, particularly in African and some Asian countries. This review paper presents one of the sustainable farming practices–vertical farming that could play a key role in mitigating global food security in the current uncertain world. It addresses the recent development of vertical farming with advanced precision monitoring and controlling system by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

Currently, the requirement of achieving a 70% increase in production often ignores the complementary factor of reducing wastage and loss to achieve sustainable food security and nutrition. This paper examines integrating lean management concepts in smallholder farming as a catalyst for sustainable agriculture, food, and nutrition security. Several sources indicate that approximately 500 million smallholder farms worldwide cultivate on under 2 ha farm size without adequate land tenure. These farms are primarily in difficult soil conditions and environmentally risk-prone areas, reducing their resilience to changes in weather conditions. Although smallholders comprise 84% of all farms with approximately 30% of global food production, the participants and their dependents constitute almost 75% of the underprivileged, hungry, and undernourished people worldwide. These conditions are exacerbated by smallholder farms experiencing more post-harvest loss due to inadequate market and access to cold storage facilities. Additionally, smallholders have limited adaptive capacity in coping with changing environments due to inadequate scientific knowledge, low income, small farm size, limited technical assistance, and marketing opportunities. Despite these challenges, smallholders are touted as potentially the backbone to implement the United Nations’ Goal #2 for Sustainable Development in achieving zero-hunger by at least 2030. This research presents Ro-Crops Agrotec, a 1.5-ha agroecology family farm in central Trinidad, as a case study with over 26 years of successfully integrating strategic lean management. The management of Ro-Crops demonstrates that sustainable agriculture and food security are achievable through strategic planning, farm management, and innovative waste removal without the measures becoming an obsession. While lean management is associated initially with auto manufacturing, the concept is equally essential in agriculture due to losses in production, post-harvest, and food processing. At the retailing and consumer stages, the annual global wastage consists of almost one-third of consumer food, estimated at approximately 1.3 billion tons. Lean management reduces waste, maximizes efficiency, and increases economic value due to productivity, quality, and flexibility as the primary performance indicators. The lean concepts help in effectively reducing wastage by developing standardised processes and continuously improving the operations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Zero Hunger aims to concurrently solve global ecological sustainability and food security concerns. Recent breakthroughs in molecular tools and approaches have allowed scientists to detect and comprehend the nature and structure of agro-biodiversity at the molecular and genetic levels, providing us an advantage over traditional methods of crop breeding. These bioinformatics techniques let us optimize our target plants for our soil-less medium and vice versa. Most of the soil-borne and seed-borne diseases are the outcomes of non-treated seed and growth media, which are important factors in low productivity. The farmers do not consider these issues, thereby facing problems growing healthy crops and suffering economic losses. This study is going to help the farmers increase their eco-friendly, chemical residue-free, quality yield of crops and their economic returns. The present invention discloses a synergistic soil-less medium that consists of only four ingredients mixed in optimal ratios by weight: vermicompost (70–80%), vermiculite (10–15%), coco peat (10–15%), and Rhizobium (0–1%). The medium exhibits better physical and chemical characteristics than existing conventional media. The vermiculite to coco peat ratio is reduced, while the vermicompost ratio is increased, with the goals of lowering toxicity, increasing plant and water holding capacity, avoiding drying of the media, and conserving water. The medium provides balanced nutrition and proper ventilation for seed germination and the growth of seedlings. Rhizobium is also used to treat the plastic bags and seeds. The results clearly show that the current synergistic soil-less environment is best for complete plant growth. Securing genetic advantages via sexual recombination, induced random mutations, and transgenic techniques have been essential for the development of improved agricultural varieties. The recent availability of targeted genome-editing technology provides a new path for integrating beneficial genetic modifications into the most significant agricultural species on the planet. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has evolved into a potent genome-editing tool for imparting genetic modifications to crop species. In addition, the integration of analytical methods like population genomics, phylogenomics, and metagenomics addresses conservation problems, while whole genome sequencing has opened up a new dimension for explaining the genome architecture and its interactions with other species. The in silico genomic and proteomic investigation was also conducted to forecast future investigations for the growth of French beans on a synergistic soil-less medium with the purpose of studying how a blend of vermicompost, vermiculite, cocopeat, and Rhizobium secrete metal ions, and other chemical compounds into the soil-less medium and affect the development of our target plant as well as several other plants. This interaction was studied using functional and conserved region analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and docking tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

We characterize the food system using a set of metrics based upon the EAT-Lancet commission dietary guidelines for both over- and under-consumption of different foods to assess country-level dietary health and sustainability in tandem. Using a partial equilibrium model of agricultural production and trade, we then project the functioning of the global agricultural system to 2050 and calculate the metrics for that year. For most regions we find increased overconsumption above the expert-defined healthy and sustainable diet thresholds, with more limited progress towards closing dietary health and sustainability gaps where they currently exist. Trade influences this dynamic into the future under certain socioeconomic conditions, and we find that under a ""business as usual""trade environment, future agricultural import profiles continue to be misaligned with dietary health and sustainability outcomes, suggesting the potential for early intervention in trade policy as a means to positively influence food system outcomes.  © 2022 Mapes et al.

Reaching the objectives of zero hunger and sustainable cities and communities (SDGs2 and 11) are urgent and complex challenges to future development. In this survey a new fish value-chain has been set up between a rural area called Nyeri district and the inhabitants of Kibera, to supply small-sized affordable and accessible fish. The main aim of this article is to investigate this best practice example to assist future initiatives to overcome the complex challenges and discuss reasons why it was successful. The methods applied to obtain information to conduct this survey include a literature review, two workshops, and five preparatory interviews of Kibera inhabitants. The contributions by two community leaders, one in Kibera and one in Nyeri, are central to understand why this project was successful. The community leaders were trusted in their local networks.

Fossil fuels are typically used to operate farm machines, contributing to carbon emissions and accelerating climate change. It is possible to mitigate environmental damage by promoting renewable or alternative fuels, namely biofuels, solar energy, biomass, wind, geothermal, small-scale hydro, and wave power. Biofuels are considered as low carbon-emitting alternatives to conventional fuels. The use of biofuels promotes reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and reduces the related detrimental impact of transport. As an alternative to fossil fuels, renewable fuels seem to present a promising scenario. However, if low carbon products are promoted, analysis of each particular product’s GHG emissions and carbon footprint (CF) is needed. Nowadays, CF is considered as the prime indicator of environmental impact, and its calculation is in utmost demand. Agriculture significantly benefits from the use of renewable resources. The carbon footprint measurement has the potential to assess and compare carbon emissions generated by agricultural products and to identify points for improving environmental performance. Several studies have compared alternative fuels with conventional fuels, and it has been proven that using alternative fuels can significantly reduce traditional fuel consumption. Bioenergy includes a number of socio- economic, technical as well as environmental benefits that helps in achieving the UN sustainable development goals (SDG). The aim to end malnutrition and hunger (SDG 2) requires a sustainable system for food production as well as resilient agriculture practices to improve agricultural productivity. The revenues from bioenergy projects can provide food and a better diet for small farming communities, thereby improving their quality of life. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive outlook of the role of alternative or biofuels in the agriculture sector, in terms of economic feasibility and carbon footprint, for sustainable development. This review also discusses the various generations of biofuels in attaining carbon neutrality, biofuel’s impact on the environment, applications in agriculture, and limitations. © 2022 by the authors."

Yet interventions aiming to improve the population's dietary habits have failed to translate into widespread health improvements. Simultaneously, the knowledge landscape has become increasingly contentious, with fat activism challenging dominant approaches to how obesity is framed and addressed. This paper is based on 24 ethnographic interviews, and explores the work of health practitioners promoting therapeutic carbohydrate restriction (‘low-carb’ diets) for people with metabolic health conditions. Drawing on Michel Callon's study of technological innovation, I show practitioners engaging in ‘on-the-job sociology’—situated sociological work to justify, and forge a space for, innovative dietary intervention. These innovators employ physiological explanations of hormones, satiety (or hunger), and pleasure (or shame), supported with personal experience, to emphasise material connections between particular eating habits and the sustainability of dietary improvement in everyday life. They resist fat activist influence on healthcare practice (that has resulted in practitioners avoiding conversations about diet, fatness and health), as well as the more extensively critiqued practices of health promotion. Deflecting blame/shame from individuals, innovators spotlight the role of the food industry in undermining public understandings of food and physiology, and dietary improvement that is achievable and sustainable. Through on-the-job sociology, innovators forge a space to engage patients in collaborative dietary experimentation and improvement. This study highlights the importance of on-the-job sociology in the contemporary knowledge landscape, providing new insights about public health in the making. © 2022"

However, the emission of greenhouse gases is not the only sustainability problem on the planet. The United Nations (UN) has listed 17 goals for sustainable development (SDGs) with the SDGs 1 (poverty) and SDGs 2 (hunger) goals being especially important. The need to produce more food to meet the growing demand of the world population has also led to the increase in pesticides to control pests and weeds. However, in recent years, a lot of damage has been done to the environment and human health by synthetic pesticides. Pesticides are produced by large corporations with little environmental commitment, and which has led to a generally negative view of the public towards persistent synthetic pesticides. The demand for more food led to the search for new pesticides and in 1990 the first neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, was introduced into agriculture, which proved to be quite efficient against pests, since the synthetic pesticides that were on the market already showed systemic resistance. However, they also brought more problems to the agricultural area than solutions. The objective of this work is to analyze the historical evolution, the advantages, and disadvantages of neonicotinoids. Despite not being the focus of the work, it is important to emphasize that pesticides based on natural products are safer, as they are part of the biota and have a relatively short environmental half-life. © 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

It is mandatory to realize that what is labeled as “edible insects” stands for more than 2,140 animal species, not counting other edible, non-crustacean arthropods. Their life cycles are as diverse as the ecological niches these animals can fill and last between some days to several years and many of them may—or may not—be reproduced in the different farming systems. Second, the level of knowledge concerning the food use of a given species is important, be it traditional, newly created by research, or a combination of both. Third, the existence of a traditional method of making the use of the insect safe and sustainable, ideally from both the traditional and the modern points of view. Fourth, the degree of effectiveness of these measures despite globalization changes in the food-supplying network. Fifth, farming conditions, particularly housing, feeding (type, composition, and contaminants), animal health and animal welfare. Sixth, processing, transport, and storage conditions of both traditional and novel insect-based foodstuffs, and seventh, consumer awareness and acceptance of these products. These main variables create a complex web of possibilities, just as with other foodstuffs that are either harvested from the wild or farmed. In this way, food safety may be reached when proper hygiene protocols are observed (which usually include heating steps) and the animals do not contain chemical residues or environment contaminants. A varying degree of sustainability can be achieved if the aforementioned variables are heeded. Hence, the question if insects can be safe and sustainable can be answered with “jein,” a German portmanteau word joining “yes” (“ja”) and “no” (“nein”).

The investment gap is defined as the additional annual investments required to end hunger in 2030 (Sustainable Development Goal SDG2) and to put agriculture on the pathway to the Paris Agreement target for 1.5°C increase over pre-industrial temperature levels. The investment gap is projected relative to a reference scenario with projections to 2030 using an integrated economic-biophysical model of the global agri-food system. In addition to showing the impacts on hunger, the modeling results are used to simulate the effect of the gap-closing investments on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. In addition to projecting the impacts of overall investment in agricultural R&D on productivity and environmental outcomes, the analysis assesses the contributions of different types of innovative technologies and farming systems to the environmental outcomes, especially technologies that contribute to sustainability outcomes. Sustainability-oriented technologies and management practices examined include conservation tillage, nitrogen-use efficiency, improved livestock management, and other climate-smart technologies. The projected results show that additional agricultural R&D investments of USD 4 billion per year above baseline investments together with USD 6.5 billion per year invested in technical climate-smart options, can reduce hunger to 5% globally and achieve 2030 GHG emission reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement 2°C and 1.5°C pathways to 2030.

However, along with addressing hunger, modern agriculture impacts the ecosystem, human health, and resources, due to huge consumption of agrochemicals, and emission-intensive farming hence urges sustainable assessment. Till now, no impact assessment is reported on world's second-largest agricultural country- India. This paper is the first of its kind in evaluating the impact of the cultivation of 21 commonly grown crops that possess high production and emissions in India. The results were discussed in the order of impact parameters in respective years with possible causes and remedial measures. The results showed that rice has topped in maximum indices followed by sugarcane, wheat, and banana. The study forecasted that coconut played a concentrated role in global warming, while potato and sugarcane have a higher impact on water and ozone depletion, respectively. The outcomes of this study suggested appropriate improvements in farming practices, which can bring the emissions down and make the system more sustainable. Besides, these 18 indices were individually assessed for their connection with the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the aspects of agricultural activities to select the appropriate indices to measure the agricultural sustainability along with the identification of gaps to upgrade the existing indices or formulate a new one. Subsequently, this helps in achieving the SDGs in India with the least impact on the environment without compromising the socio-economic aspects involved in crop production and agricultural systems. © 2021 The Authors"

Even if insects are part of the diet of more than two billion people worldwide, the practice of eating insects (entomophagy) raises challenging questions for Western countries where this is not a habit. The research applied the Rasch models and showed that, in the case of hunger or need, 70.8% of the sample declared that they would be willing to eat insects. The willingness to habitually consume and pay for insect food is very low, but the percentages are higher than people who had actually had insect tasting experiences. This demonstrates that a communication process is necessary that aims to overcome psychological/cultural barriers. Only in this way will it be possible to increase the propensity to consume insects. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Turkey has long struggled against climate variability and catastrophic climatic events to prevent further declines in agricultural output. This study assessed the risk of climate change in Turkey from the perspective of loss in food grains and food security domain considering exposure to extreme climate events using the data from 1991 to 2019. This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the literature by identifying the relationship between food waste and food import, food prices and economic growth. It also makes an empirical contribution by administering and econometrically analyzing the impact of the loss of food grains on the aforementioned independent variables. Policy implications for the current national agriculture policy were provided using the vector auto-regression (VAR) model and derivative analysis. Food grain loss negatively correlates with food security since it increases reliance on food imports from outside. Moreover, the losses in food supplies contributes greatly to price increases. The GDP growth rate, however, was shown to be a feeble instigator. Climate change threatens food security, and the country’s progress toward sustainable development objectives is hampered in general, particularly concerning no poverty and zero hunger goals. In conclusion, climate change and its associated factors harm Turkey’s food security and economy. © 2022 by the authors."

Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the agricultural production system and on consumption conditions. This means that ‘access’ to food should be determined with respect to the three dimensions of economic, physical and solidarity access to a quantity of food that fulfils both people’s nutritional needs and environmentally responsible consumption patterns. In Italy, 9.9% of the total population, i.e., six million people, live in a state of food insecurity. In Rome, 9.4% of the population lives in a condition of material deprivation, and applications for Citizens’ Income have increased, as well as food aids which amounted to EUR 20 million in 2020. The relationships between the cost of healthy and sustainable diets (which would cost 60% more than a staple diet) and the increasing economic difficulties people are facing, have prompted a focus on the multidimensional nature of food security, with particular emphasis on people’s ability to access food. In this paper, analyzing the Metropolitan City of Rome (Italy) as a case study, we present a pilot and innovative work on an affordability index to healthy and sustainable diet. A geospatial analysis highlights areas where economic difficulties in accessing food overlap with the shortage/absence of food retail outlets and with a lack of solidarity networks (e.g., civil society food distribution initiatives), allowing a new concept to come into focus, namely the blacked-out food areas. This concept helps to identify those areas in which people are socially excluded and cannot enjoy the same substantive food-related choices as people in other areas. The research outcomes provide insights into the geographical areas and neighborhoods characterized by critical access to healthy and sustainable food, providing crucial information for the planning and implementation of targeted social policies to tackle food insecurity. © 2023 by the authors."

This is often difficult, due to feed and fodder scarcity especially in developing countries like India. The scarcity is more acute in landless animal and poultry production. Studies indicate potential of using fruit and vegetable wastes (FVWs) as feed, citing its nutritional value. On the other hand, FVWs are a burden and threat to environment. Unexplored areas of FVW research need to be studied for neutralizing threat by processing and recycling FVWs into animal and poultry feed. This paper gives an overview of the potential of FVWs as animal and poultry feed. Also, it describes the way forward and strategies to confront the constraints and challenges, highlights social marketing on waste disposal with special reference to FVWs and emphasizes collaborative involvement of stakeholders involved in fruit and vegetable value chain. As animals and poultry do directly and indirectly contribute to many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), farmers and stakeholders of fruit and vegetable value chain need to be intervened with strategic extension and research initiatives to propagate and utilize the potential of FVWs as animal and poultry feed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

Political conflict, economic slowdown, climate changes, and a pandemic are apparently becoming threats to progress. As one of the externalities of a food system, public policy like social protection programs, encompassed a range of regulations and programs used for problem-solving and holds a determinant role in the long term application of food systems. However, the food system is a complex web of activities that involve all fundamental aspects of social, environmental, and economic to achieve the state of the equilibrium system. The negative outcomes towards the environment are unavoidable since 26% of global emissions is coming from food production, processing, and distribution. The impact assessment of social protection policies towards the environment remains limited. This paper investigates the environmental impacts of three social protection programs: cash transfer, food subsidy, and in-kind transfer; using a system dynamics approach. The conceptual model provides a deep-structural insight and understanding of the ideas on how social protection programs in the food and agricultural system strongly influence the outturn of the environmental impacts. The developed model has shown the interlinkages of household expenditure increment, which influences by income level and social protection access that caused more dynamics and uncertain behavior in food consumption level. This considered as more impactful for environment sustainability since it will cause more production and distribution activities which drawn more greenhouse gas and food loss.

Recently, there has been a paradigm shift away from harvesting peat as a fuel towards the development of wettable peatland innovation (termed ‘paludiculture’), such as aquaculture. Such eco-innovations support carbon sequestration and align with a balanced environmental approach to protecting biodiversity. This novel peatland-based IMTA process in the Irish midlands relies upon natural microalgae for waste treatment, recirculation and water quality where there is no use of pesticides or antibiotics. This novel IMTA system is powered with a wind turbine and the process has ‘organic status’; moreover, it does not discharge aquaculture effluent to receiving water. However, there is a significant lack of understanding as to diversity of microalgae in this ‘paludiculture’-based IMTA processes. This constitutes the first case study to use conventional microscopy combined with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to profile microalgae occurring in this novel IMTA system from pooled samples over a 12 month period in 2020. Conventional microscopy combined with classic identification revealed twenty genera of algae; with Chlorophyta and Charophyta being the most common present. However, algal DNA isolation, 16 s sequencing and bioinformatics revealed a combined total of 982 species from 341 genera across nine phyla from the same IMTA system, which emphasized a significant underestimation in the number and diversity of beneficial or potentially harmful algae in the IMTA-microbiome. These new methods also yield rich data that can be used by digital technologies to transform future monitoring and performance of the IMTA system for sustainability. The findings of this study align with many sustainability development goals of the United Nations including no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, responsible consumption and production, climate change, and life below water. © 2022 The Authors"

Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model. © 2022 by the authors."

Four systems are considered: (i) human system; (ii) agriculture; (iii) aquaculture; (iv) nature. Exploring the changes during 1980–2015 and 2015–2050 according to the SSPs shows that the natural nutrient sources have been declining in the past decades and will continue to decline in all SSPs in future decades due to massive land transformations, while agriculture, human sewage and aquaculture are becoming increasingly dominant (globally up to 80% of nutrient delivery). More efforts than those employed in any of the SSPs are needed to slow down the global nutrient cycles. One of the drivers of the proliferation of harmful algal blooms is the tendency towards increasing N:P ratios in global freshwaters and export to the global coastal seas; this is the result of increasing N:P in inputs in food production, more efficient biogeochemical retention of P than of N in river basins, and groundwater N legacies, which seems to be most pronounced in a united world that strives after sustainability. The diverging strategies to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals 14 (life below water), 2 (zero hunger) and 6 (clean water and sanitation) therefore require a balanced management system for both N and P in all systems, that accounts for future nutrient legacies. © 2021 The Author(s)"

To determine the importance of this problem in the modern global economic system, a sample of countries, which are the largest food importers, is created. Based on this sample, the method of regression analysis is used to determine the impact of agriculture’s sustainability on the successfulness of solving the problem of food deficit in countries where this problem is the most urgent. The authors determine the target goals (control values of the indicators) of sustainable development of agriculture for overcoming food deficit and for import substitution in countries of the sample. For the best information and empirical support for import substitution, the quantitative analysis is supplemented with qualitative analysis—SWOT analysis is used to study the current problems (barriers) and perspectives of developing agriculture in countries that import food. A view from the positions of sustainable development of agricultural entrepreneurship allows evaluating macro-level and micro-level problems of the agrarian economy of food importers and suggesting policy and management implications.

However, the required development and transformation of marine systems for farming may have unknown implications for sustainability objectives, such as those outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim of this paper is to outline the opportunities for, and threats from, seaweed farming in the context of sustainability. We synthesise the perspectives of expert stakeholders from multiple sectors through a series of Australian workshops to catalogue the pathways through which seaweed farming may affect sustainability, giving specific focus to the SDGs. In doing so, this study illustrates that seaweed farming has the potential to influence, to some degree, the majority of SDGs, with both positive and negative influences. Indeed, seaweed farming is most likely to benefit progress towards achieving SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 12 (Sustainable Production and Consumption), and 15 (Life on Land). But expectations of seaweed farming may also fall short for supporting some goals if appropriate measures are not implemented to mitigate potential impacts, most notably SDG 14 (Life Below Water). We underscore that seaweed farming has the potential to contribute to sustainable development, and that this potential can only be realised with appropriate regulation and mitigation to avoid unwanted negative outcomes. Better identification and management of trade-offs between these potential positive and negative outcomes across sustainability domains, will be critical for realising the full potential of seaweed aquaculture for sustainable development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This has led to an erosion of agricultural biodiversity and balanced diets and contributed to climate change and rising rates of chronic metabolic diseases. Modern food supply chains have progressively lost dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, micronutrients, and several classes of phytochemicals with high bioactivity and nutritional relevance.

The article is divided into two parts. The first part provides an illustrative study in which computer tools were utilized to investigate media reporting. The study examined the relative coverage of issues of basic human needs (food, clean water, and sanitation), which are part of the focus of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, in four major newspapers from Malaysia, Singapore, the UK and the US. Data were collected between November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in its early days in terms of worldwide attention. During that time period, the pandemic received far more coverage in those newspapers than did the other issues, even though basic human needs greatly outweighed the COVID-19 pandemic as to deaths and other forms of suffering at the time of data collection, not to mention the toll on human life in the many years before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Reasons for this severe discrepancy were explored with insights from professionals working in the media and related sectors. The skewed distribution of media coverage, we argue, reflects a crisis of responsibility and values. The second part of the article serves to highlight how those of us in language studies can make a contribution to the wider discussion about, among other important concerns, the role and responsibility of media in shaping the public's views and actions on issues that are at the heart of sustainable development, and how we can be more socially engaged.

We conducted two studies, one using a self-report measure and one using a behavioral measure of willingness to eat insects. In both studies, higher food neophobia predicted reduced willingness to eat insects. Disgust predicted lower self-reported, but not behavioral, willingness to eat insects. By contrast, hunger did not predict willingness to eat insects in either study. Our findings suggest that reducing food neophobia toward insects may be important for acceptance of entomophagy and may inform future marketing strategies that aim to encourage people to view insect protein as a viable source of nutrition. © 2022"

Thus, their social responsibility is primarily the “brain print” they leave on their audience. Communication of, about, and for sustainability through mass media is therefore essential to create a shared understanding of societal values on sustainability, creating public engagement, and contributing to sustainable development. Accordingly, the present study aims at understanding how media (companies) take their responsibility as key communicators in the public sphere and analyze how they communicate and thus construct the sustainability discourse through their products. For this, sustainability-related content produced and broadcasted by the two largest commercial media companies in Germany (RTL and ProSiebenSat1; n = 50 online articles and n = 89 videos, 601 min in total) was analyzed by qualitative content analysis and rhetoric text analysis to understand what and how media communicate sustainability. Results show that most media sustainability-related content addresses food issues, followed by issues regarding resources and the environment, thus contributing to the achievement of some of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Namely: SDG#2 (zero hunger), #6 (clean water and sanitation), #13 (climate action), #14 (life below water), and #15 (life on land). These issues are primarily communicated logically, appealing to the audience’s reason (logos, 76%), while the ethical appeal ethos (22%) and the emotional pathos (2%) scarcely occur.

Meanwhile, there is growing consensus across scientific disciplines that fish plays a crucial role in food and nutrition security. However, this ‘fish as food’ perspective has yet to translate into policy and development funding priorities. We argue that the traditional framing of fish as a natural resource emphasizes economic development and biodiversity conservation objectives, whereas situating fish within a food systems perspective can lead to innovative policies and investments that promote nutrition-sensitive and socially equitable capture fisheries and aquaculture. This paper highlights four pillars of research needs and policy directions toward this end. Ultimately, recognizing and working to enhance the role of fish in alleviating hunger and malnutrition can provide an additional long-term development incentive, beyond revenue generation and biodiversity conservation, for governments, international development organizations, and society more broadly to invest in the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This has resulted in a global micronutrient deficiency and hunger. Given rapid urbanization and population growth, a more sustainable food system is necessary to feed more urban populations and provide adequate nutrition, especially in developing countries. Existing frameworks for modelling urban-environment interactions contain components related to food security, however, lack the specificity needed to evaluate the effects of land use decisions and agricultural production strategies on the health of local populations measured through metrics such as nutritional output. The research presented here proposes an urban nutrition (UN) extension to the previously published urban ecological economic system by developing a focused component that simulates scenarios of different degrees of urbanization and agricultural production techniques to improve the nutritional output of agricultural land, while considering the conservation of soil. This simulation approach was subsequently applied to the Toluca Metropolitan Zone, Mexico. Results showed that nutritional output would greatly increase when adding a variety of crops, even in scenarios where agricultural land is limited. The proposed extension can be used by decision makers worldwide to evaluate how landscape configurations and agricultural production systems affect the nutritional needs of the local population while fostering sustainable practices. © 2022 by the authors.

Actually, participants (Study 1 N = 80, Study 2 N = 78) were given the same non-mealworm containing food in all conditions. Disgust was measured using: tactile sensitivity, food intake, liking and desire to eat. Results of Study 1 showed that a sustainability passage (sustainability advantages of entomophagy), but not a delicacy passage (oro-sensory qualities of insects), was effective in reducing disgust. In Study 2, contrary to prediction, a passage describing the sustainability and nutritional advantages entomophagy failed to reduce disgust - falafel intake, liking and desire to eat were decreased. However, a passage which described how mealworm flour is produced, did significantly reduce disgust. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that written passages can alter the disgust response, notably resulting in a maintenance of food intake. Interventions that increase the perception of familiarity of a novel food, but not logic-based arguments, may be a key driver of the amelioration of disgust. These results also support the suggestion that altering the ideational component of disgust can result in changes of distaste perception. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

This study aims to identify the intellectual structure of food security research and the changes in this structure. This paper analyzed 3169 documents from the Web of Science database through a bibliometric review. A review of the published documents shows an increasing trend over the past 46 years. In accordance with co-occurrence analysis, 125 keywords were grouped into five clusters: food security and sustainable development; food security and socioeconomic factors; food security policy and governance; coping strategies for poverty, inequality, and hunger; and modern food security management. This study identifies four streams within food security research: sustainability and environmental, socioe-conomic, cultural, and political factors. The paper concludes that even though food security might investigate many significant areas, other new dimensions should still be considered. Further gaps in the literature emerge that present avenues for future research directions.

It is crucial to safeguard the recognized benefits of mainstream traditional foods and ingredients, which gradually eroded in the last decades. Notwithstanding poverty, chronic hunger, malnutrition, and undernourishment in the region, traditional eating habits have been related to positive health outcomes and sustainability. The research prevailed dealing with food availability and access rather than the health, nutrition, and diet quality dimensions of food security based on what people consume per country and on the missing data related to nutrient composition of indigenous foods. As countries become more economically developed, they shift to “modern” occidental foods rich in saturated fats, salt, sugar, fizzy beverages, and sweeteners. As a result, there are increased incidences of previously unreported ailments due to an unbalanced diet. Protein-rich foods in dietary guidelines enhance only those of animal or plant sources, while rich protein sources such as mushrooms have been absent in these charts, even in developed countries. This article considers the valorization of traditional African foodstuffs and ingredients, enhancing the importance of establishing food-based dietary guidelines per country. The crux of this review highlights the potential of mushrooms, namely some underutilized in the SSA, which is the continent's little exploited gold mine as one of the greatest untapped resources for feeding and providing income for Africa’s growing population, which could play a role in shielding Sub-Saharan Africans against the side effects of an unhealthy stylish diet. © 2021 by the authors.

This environmental sustainability is related to different SDGs, but mainly to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The strategies and measures used to improve this aspect of the food supply chain must remain in balance with other sustainability aspects (economic and social). In this framework, the interactions and possible conflicts between food supply chain safety and sustainability need to be assessed. Although priority must be given to safety aspects, food safety policies should be calibrated in order to avoid unnecessary deleterious effects on the environment. In the present review, a number of potential tensions and/or disagreements between the microbial safety and environmental sustainability of the fresh produce supply chain are identified and discussed. The addressed issues are spread throughout the food supply chain, from primary production to the end-of-life of the products, and also include the handling and processing industry, retailers, and consumers. Interactions of fresh produce microbial safety with topics such as food waste, supply chain structure, climate change, and use of resources have been covered. Finally, approaches and strategies that will prove useful to solve or mitigate the potential contradictions between fresh produce safety and sustainability are described and discussed. Upon analyzing the interplay between microbial safety and the environmental sustainability of the fresh produce supply chain, it becomes clear that decisions that are taken to ensure fresh produce safety must consider the possible effects on environmental, economic, and social sustainability aspects. To manage these interactions, a global approach considering the interconnections between human activities, animals, and the environment will be required. © 2021 by the authors.

This review adopts an economic lens to assessing potential transitions to ideal food systems that are productive, sustainable, nutritious, resilient, and inclusive. Our findings show that new technologies, policies, institutions, and behavior changes can leverage synergies for achieving multiple food system targets, but rigorous economic analysis is needed to further analyze trade-offs and to overcome complex behavioral, institutional, and political barriers.

Sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia in particular have experienced a significant increase in climate variability over the past decade, which has led to more frequent weather extremes such as floods and droughts. Because 85% of Ethiopia depends upon agriculture for its livelihoods, such rainfall shortages or excesses can impede food production, access to financial and natural assets, and the ability to recover in subsequent crop seasons. This means that climate variability in agriculture not only affects the availability of the food Ethiopians consume, but also the income of its smallholder farmers. Variability in rainfall and temperature can also have adverse effects on livestock and the pastoralists whose livelihoods depend upon it. Thus, all development planning and practice in the agriculture and related sectors need to take climate variability and long-term climate change into account. Climate services can contribute to the alleviation of a range of climate-sensitive development challenges, including agricultural production and food security. The Adapting Agriculture to Climate Today for Tomorrow (ACToday) approach of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), Columbia University, USA, aims to develop climate service solutions through enhancement of the availability and effectiveness of climate information in national policy, planning, management, and other decision-making processes in countries that are particularly dependent on agriculture and vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and change. It targets improved food security, nutrition, environmental sustainability and economic outcomes in these countries by promoting the use of climate information and services to manage current climate risks, while laying the foundation for adaptation to future climatic conditions. In this Perspective, we share experiences from the implementation of the ACToday project and approach in Ethiopia, outlining its accomplishments and challenges. In doing so, we characterize best practices and pitfalls to avoid to ensure climate knowledge and information truly meet the needs of climate-informed decision making and climate-smart policy and planning. We also outline pragmatic guidance to ensure activities designed to evolve climate research into services are done so appropriately, responsibly, and sustainably to bridge the gap between those who produce climate information and those who ultimately use it.

Within the framework of sustainable development, agriculture has dimensions as a complex ecosystem of which biodiversity and productivity must be maintained. Accordingly, organic agriculture is an agricultural system that holistically pays attention to the sustainability of biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activities. The problems faced by farmers are the attack of disease-causing pathogens; the level of pathogen attack can even cause crop failure. Phytophthora infestans is a pathogen that causes root, stem, and leaf disease, and this disease is hazardous for plants. Phytophthora infestans are challenging to control, easily transmitted, and have the highest virulence when the plant is in the vegetative period.

Future HGI should apply Systemic-Transdisciplinary approaches with adequate metrics and multidimensional IA methodologies linking FNS and sustainable development. This would allow a contextualisation of the research, establishing the current situation of the study system and identifying precise needs. Also, it would be possible to identify and monitor trade-offs and synergies of the intervention. Such approach would generate a strong body of scientific evidence and awareness of the benefits of a sustainable agricultural system in the prevention and treatment of the double burden of malnutrition (hidden hunger and overweight/obesity). © 2021 by the authors."

For the last few decades, China has made remarkable achievements in food production and has contributed greatly to the reduction in global hunger and poverty. Examining experiences and lessons from China’s food security practices over the years is helpful to promote a national food system transformation for China, as well as other developing countries. This study systematically reviews the literature on Chinese food security studies, with the aim of assessing China’s food security achievements and examining the remaining and emerging issues in the pursuit of food system transformation. The results show that China has continuously promoted food system transformation in land consolidation, agri-food production technologies, management and organization modes, food reserves, trade governance, and food consumption. These transformations ensure not only food availability, timeliness, and nutrition, but also in terms of the ecological, social, and economic sustainability, feasibility, and justice of food security. However, China is also confronting new challenges in food security, for example, malnutrition, environmental unsustainability, and reductions in diversified agri-food. In the future, China is expected to be committed to promoting healthy diets, sustainable agricultural production, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of food waste and loss to enhance its agri-food system’s resilience. © 2022 by the authors.

Calls are coming from all quarters that the food system is broken and needs a radical transformation. A system that feeds many yet continues to create both extreme hunger and diet-related diseases, and one which has significant environmental impacts, is not serving the world adequately. This volume argues that True Cost Accounting in our food system can create a framework for a systemic shift. What sounds on the surface like a practice relegated to accountants is ultimately a call for a new lens on the valuation of food and a new relationship with the food we eat, starting with the reform of a system out of balance. From the true cost of corn, rice and water, to incentives for soil health, the chapters economically compare conventional and regenerative, more equitable farming practices in and food system structures, including taking an unflinching look at the true cost of cheap labour. Overall, this volume points towards the potential for our food system to be more human-centred than profit-centred and one that has a more respectful relationship to the planet. It sets forth a path forward based on True Cost Accounting for food. This path seeks to fix our current food metrics, in policy and in practice, by applying a holistic lens that evaluates the actual costs and benefits of different food systems, and the impacts and dependencies between natural systems, human systems, agriculture and food systems. This volume is essential reading for professionals and policymakers involved in developing and reforming the food system, as well as students and scholars working on food policy, food systems and sustainability. © Taylor and Francis 2021.

By increasing the sustainability of food and agriculture, the food system will be able to handle challenges such as climate change, declining agricultural resources, growing population/urbanization, pandemics, and recessions/shortages. Micronutrient deficiency, otherwise called hidden hunger, is one of the major malnutrition consequences worldwide, particularly in middle- or low- income countries. Unlike essential mineral or nutrient compounds, micronutrients could be less of a priority due to their small levels of requirement. However, insufficient micronutrients caused critical adverse health symptoms and are excessively vital for young children’s development. Therefore, there have been numerous attempts to enhance minerals and nutrients in food crops, including biofortification, food fortification, and supplementation. Based on several interventions involving micronutrients, modern technology, such as nanotechnology, can be applied to enhance sustainability and to reduce the food system’s environmental impact. Previous studies have addressed various strategies or interventions to mitigate major micronutrient deficiency including iron, iodine, zinc, and vitamin A. Comparably small amounts of studies have addressed vitamin B12 deficiency and its fortification in food crops. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes serious adverse health effects, including in the nervous or blood systems, and occurs along with other micronutrient deficiencies, such as folate, iron, and zinc, worldwide, particularly in middle- and low-income countries. Mitigation for B12 deficiency has mainly focused on developing pharmacological and medical treatments such as vitamin B12 serum or supplements. Further studies are required to undertake a sustainable approach to fortify vitamin B12 in plant-based food sources for public health worldwide. This review paper highlights nanoparticle application as a promising technology for enhancing vitamin B12 without conventional genetic modification requirements. The nanoparticle can efficiently deliver the mineral/nutrient using coating techniques to targeted sites into the plant. This is mainly because nanoparticles have better solubility and permeability due to their nano size with high surface exposure. Vitamin B12-coated nanoparticles would be absorbed, translocated, and accumulated by the plant and eventually enhance the bioavailability in food crops. Furthermore, by reducing adverse environmental effects, such as leaching issues that mainly occur with conventional fertilizer usage, it would be possible to develop more sustainable food fortification. © Copyright © 2021 Oh, Cave and Lu."

This article aims to assess the contributions of IITA’s circular bioeconomy focused innovations towards economic, social, and environmental outcomes using the outcome tracking approach, and identify areas for strengthening existing circular bioeconomy R4D interventions using the gap analysis method. Data used for the study came from secondary sources available in the public domain. Results indicate that IITA’s circular bioeconomy interventions led to ten technological innovations (bio-products) that translated into five economic, social, and environmental outcomes, including crop productivity, food security, resource use efficiency, job creation, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Our gap analysis identified eight gaps leading to a portfolio of five actions needed to enhance the role of circular bioeconomy in SSA. The results showcase the utility of integrating a circular bioeconomy approach in R4D work, especially how using such an approach can lead to significant economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The evidence presented can help inform the development of a framework to guide circular bioeconomy R4D at IITA and other research institutes working in SSA. Generating a body of evidence on what works, including the institutional factors that create enabling environments for circular bioeconomy approaches to thrive, is necessary for governments and donors to support circular bioeconomy research that will help solve some of the most pressing challenges in SSA as populations grow and generate more waste, thus exacerbating a changing climate using the linear economy model. © 2021 by the authors.

The increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall are exacerbating water scarcity challenges through drought recurrence. There is an urgent need for pathways that lead towards Sustainable Development Goals, mainly Goals 1 (no poverty) and 2 (zero hunger) in poor rural communities. This study assessed rainfall and temperature trends from 1960 to 2018 and their impacts on crop production in the Mopani and Vhembe Districts of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Trend analysis was used to analyse rainfall patterns, as well as the trends in temperature recorded for the past 58 years. The climate moisture index (CMI) and runoff estimates were used to assess the degree of aridity and water availability, respectively. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data were used to assess the changes over time. The total annual rainfall has declined significantly while annual minimum and maximum temperatures have increased significantly during the period under observation. An aridity index of −0.70 calculated for the study areas classifies the districts as dry and water scarce. The results of the analysis also indicate that the districts are climate change hot spots, and are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The changes are compounding water and food insecurity.

Specific sub-group populations are at risk of vitamin B12 subclinical deficiency due to different factors including poor intake of animal source foods and age-dependent decrease in the capacity of intestinal B12 uptake. Consumption of animal products produces some negative health issues and negatively impacts sustainability while a plant-based diet increases the risk of B12 deficiency.

To gain such understanding, a transdisciplinary approach is increasingly called for by funders, end users of research and scientists. Transdisciplinary processes were used in the UNISECO project to develop strategic pathways that enable transitions to agroecology in case studies across Europe. These strategic pathways were combined with scenarios of EU food systems in 2050, in which combinations of agroecological farming and food consumption practices were assessed. These were then reviewed considering selected UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a reference for discussing the sustainability implications of transitions to agroecology. Sustainability implications were identified for several SDGs including Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Quality Education (SDG 4), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), Climate Action (SDG 13) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Key factors contributing to the sustainability of transitions to agroecology are: i) mature social capital and improved farmer knowledge of the benefits of agroecological practices; ii) strengthened collaborative actions and collective institutions to increase negotiating power within the value-chain; and, iii) changes in consumer behaviour and diets. These factors highlight the need for a food system perspective in transitions to agroecology and supporting policies.

This article calculates the investments needed for both acute and sustainable systems to alleviate food insecurity and decrease global caloric deficits. These economic values are then contextualized by comparing funds spent by individuals and governments on unnecessary or counterproductive products. The results show that divergence of even small fractions of these funds from food waste, tobacco, alcohol, or weapons within the U.S. alone could supplement the caloric needs of those in areas with high levels of food insecurity. America’s net-negative industries whose advertisements and sales could be taxed to improve America’s life expectancy could fund the yearly cost to feed anywhere from 17.1% to 1,467.9% of malnourished people directly, or contribute more than 100% of the estimated cost to sustainably end global hunger.

Also, the present sustainable system is investigated thermodynamically by considering energy and exergy criteria and evaluated through energy and exergy efficiencies. As a case study, the Saugeen First Nation indigenous community in the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, Canada, is selected for meeting the demands of useful commodities where an integration of a newly developed multigenerational system with an existing nuclear reactor is achieved in order to provide food security, supply the freshwater for drinking purposes, and meet the community's electricity and heat demands. Moreover, to exploit the existing thermophysical properties of fluids in the nuclear system, a hydrogen generation unit is proposed.

The need for higher agricultural production has resulted in following the unsustainable ways of farming, which is degrading both soil and ecosystems. Hence, going back to the traditional sustainable approach to restore the productivity of agro ecosystems is an urgent need. Agroforestry can be considered as a system of farming in which trees, animals, and annual crops are strategically planted and grown to maximize outputs through various interactions of the system components. Agroforestry interventions can contribute to food and nutritional security in several different ways. These interventions can ensure food availability, strengthen access to food and nutrients in rural areas, and play a complementary role in utilization by increasing the quality of the diet. Increased productions of nonfood agroforestry outputs can improve income, which in turn can improve the household food consumption. Various agroforestry systems like agri-silvi, agri-horti, and silvi-pasture systems satisfy the diverse needs of people and help in fulfilling the four pillars of food and nutritional security, namely, availability, access, utilization, and stability. Additional benefits from agroforestry that support increasing food and nutrition security include increasing the availability time for household members and the productivity of existing crops. However, the potential of agroforestry in achieving the food and nutritional security has been underexploited due to lack of awareness and policy issues. The need to exploit these ecosystems not only helps to accomplish zero hunger but also the hidden hunger. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

Micronutrient deficiency and hunger have been exacerbated worldwide. Balancing social, economic, and environmental needs and demands is complex, and often presents tradeoffs between nutritional security and sustainable practices. While various frameworks have been developed to support policy and decision makers in prioritizing tradeoffs that impact urbanization and food production, they are not easily operationalized due to complexities of implementation stemming from the availability of data, place-specific nuances, and methodological difficulties, among others. There is a need to develop analytical approaches to enable researchers, planners, and policymakers to better understand the impact of land use choices on sustainable local food production.

This research proposes a simulation strategy to evaluate the impact of agricultural land use and crop choices on nutritional production in rapidly growing urban areas. The application of this framework for decision-making is exemplified in the Toluca Metropolitan Zone, Mexico by showing how tradeoffs between macronutrient and micronutrient daily requirements could be explored under a variety of land use scenarios.

Food security, natural disasters, and climate change are thought to be interrelated. Climate change contributes to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, drought, land and forest fires, resulting in reduced food production, increased food prices, and disrupted access to food distribution. Ultimately, the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are one of the main causes of hunger and affect all dimensions of food security. This study aimed to analyze the impact of climate change, natural disasters, and other determinants on food security in Indonesia using the Tobit regression. The data used was from 33 provinces in 2010-2018. Climate change was proxied by rainfall, while natural disasters were proxied by the frequency of natural disasters and facility damage due to disasters. The results showed that food crop production, GRDP per capita, and the average years of schooling had a significant effect on increasing food security. Meanwhile, rainfall and deforestation had a significant effect on reducing food security. On the other hand, although not significant, the frequency and damage to facilities due to natural disasters harms food security. The results of this study confirmed the importance of preserving forest biodiversity as an effort to achieve food security as seen from the negative effects of rainfall and deforestation on food security. In this case, deforestation was one of the contributors to climate change which in turn had an impact on the intensity of natural disasters. To achieve food security for the achievement of the SDGs, policies to reduce deforestation or forest conversion need attention as one of the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Therefore, improving and sustaining agricultural crops yield without posing negative impact on environment should be the ultimate goal to meet food and nutritional requirement around the world. Application of chemical fertilizers although has increased the crop productivity but simultaneously has posed serious threat to human and environmental health. Therefore, biofertilizers from microorganisms have potential to replace these chemical fertilizers in sustaining agricultural productivity and maintaining environmental health. Moreover biofertilizers are easy to use and less expensive than chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers includes one or more beneficial microbes that facilitate better nutrient uptake, greater production of growth hormone and beneficial phytochemicals in crops leading to higher quantity as well quality crop production. Nitrogen-fixing microbes, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), sulfur-solubilizing bacteria (SSB), potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB), and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) etc. are already being utilized in combination for making biofertilizers formulations for enhancing crop production but on small scale. Thus, large scale exploitation of agriculturally important microbes for sustaining agricultural productivity is the need of the hour.

This research explores actors and organisations in the value chain of surplus food distribution at the city level. Based on semi-structured interviews and participant observation, our findings highlight the need for a coordinated effort between actors as an essential arrangement to capture the value of surplus food. Despite the close cooperation, hierarchical power relationships exist between organisations in the supply chain.

The minimization of food loss (FL) is one of the main contemporary challenges required to achieve food security and a sustainable food system. Information about FL in the primary production of developing countries is scarce, yet it is precisely these countries that have less support in preventing FL. The research herein focuses on estimating FL and characterizing its main causes in the agricultural sector of the agri-food giant Mexican state of Jalisco. This work uses a self-reported approach to survey and interview producers of the state's core crops (including corn, sugarcane, agave, tomato, avocado and banana). The mean FL was found to be 14.0%, which is lower than previously reported for developing countries. FL, in the agricultural sector, was attributed mainly to pests and weather conditions, followed by market failures or inadequate marketing systems. FL variations were found to be dependent on the type of producer and crop. FL values were lower for large producers and for products with high international demand. Smaller producers generally reported higher FL values due to a lack of trained personnel and low application of technological practices or equipment. The transdisciplinary approach used here also led to solutions, which can be a key step to mitigating FL and to transitioning to a more sustainable approach. In developing countries, such as Mexico, it is important to create more and better connections between producers and institutions dedicated to avoiding FL. © 2021 The Authors"

Undernutrition and obesity are to the opposite of a healthy nutritional status. Both conditions are associated with unbalanced nutrition, absence of food or excess of non-nutritive foods intake. These two nutritional conditions associated with food production are closely related to some goals highlighted by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda to achieve sustainable world development. In this context, the search for alternative foods whose sustainable production and high nutritional quality guarantee regular access to food for the population must be encouraged. Alternative foods can contribute to Food Security in many ways as they contribute to the local economy and income generation. Popularizing and demystifying the uses of unconventional food plants, ancestral grains, flowers, meliponiculture products, and edible insects as sources of nutrients and non-nutrients is another challenge. Herein, we present an overview of alternative foods – some of them cultivated mostly in Brazil – that can be explored as sources of nutrients to fight hunger and malnutrition, improve food production and the economic growth of nations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Broiler meat is South Africa's most affordable meat option, supporting household food and nutrition security. Although considered healthier and less environmentally harmful than ruminant meat, it is not without food safety risks and environmental impacts. This research aimed to present the foremost commercial broiler system narratives in South Africa, around targets of SDG 2, and to discuss key considerations for policymakers. Twenty-nine key informants and stakeholders, purposively selected to cover a wide range of opinions, participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts underwent a qualitative framework analysis. Results showed a highly efficient system, dominated by a small number of interlinked large-scale actors, vulnerable to competition from cheaper imports, yet pressurized to maintain high food safety and environmental impact standards, with a price-sensitive consumer base. Existing policies lack integration and enforcement capacity, and are undermined by siloed government departments, and mistrust and power struggles between public and private sectors. We propose removal of silo walls, and trust building through participatory policy development, with collaborative and transformative public-private partnerships that are designed to build capacity to deliver sustainable solutions. © Copyright © 2021 Queenan, Cuevas, Mabhaudhi, Chimonyo, Slotow and Häsler."

Design/methodology/approach: Two versions of an online survey were developed on the citizen science platform, Zooniverse. The surveys explored citizen estimations of energy density (kcal) or carbon footprint (Co2) and food safety or animal welfare of 29 commonly eaten foods. Survey recruitment was conducted via paid promotions on Twitter and Facebook and via paid respondent invites on Qualtrics. The study included approximately 500 participants (Facebook, N˜11 (ratings 358), Twitter, N˜85 (ratings 2,184), Qualtrics, N = 398 (ratings 11,910)). Kruskal–Wallis and Chi-square analyses compared citizen estimations with validated values and assessed the impact of the variables on estimations. Findings: Citizens were unable to accurately estimate carbon footprint and energy content, with most citizens overestimating values. Citizen estimates were most accurate for meat products. Qualtrics was the most successful recruitment method for the online survey. Citizen estimates between platforms were significantly different, suggesting that Facebook and Twitter may not be suitable recruitment methods for citizen online surveys. Practical implications: Qualtrics was the favourable platform for survey recruitment. However, estimates across all recruitment platforms were poor. As paid recruitment methods such as Qualtrics are costly, the authors recommend continued examination of the social media environment to develop appropriate, affordable and timely online recruitment strategies for citizen science. Originality/value: The findings indicate that citizens are unable to accurately estimate the carbon footprint and energy content of foods suggesting a focus on consumer education is needed to enable consumers to move towards more sustainable and healthy diets. Essential if we are to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of zero hunger, good health and wellbeing and responsible consumption and production.

Ensuring sustainable access to safe and sufficient water, improved sanitation facilities, clean energy sources and healthy food is a necessary requirement for ending hunger and poverty, advancing health and achieving all the goals of the sustainable development agenda. Socio-economic variables are determinant factors of water, energy and food accessibility. Ecological region, income and education are measures used in this study, which aims to examine a pairwise comparison of water and energy sources, sanitation facilities and food accessibilities in six sampling communities and tracking progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDG) at a local scale using nine specific SDG indicators. A study involving questionnaire administration covering 1785 households across the three ecological regions of Katsina state was performed. Two communities representing urban and rural households from each of the ecological regions were selected. An analysis of variance was used to test the equality of resource accessibility across the investigated communities followed up by a post hoc analysis to identify significant mean groups. The results showed that the overall access level to safely manage water and sanitation facilities were 16.5% and 28.1%, respectively. Access indices of 1.83 and 1.24 for electricity and cooking fuel, respectively, were calculated in the study area.

Nowadays, they are a non-timber forest product and a diverse genetic resource with great ecological, sociocultural, economic, medicinal and biotechnological relevance around the world. Therefore, they have a paramount role to play in meeting the United Nations global sustainable development goals 2030. EMF may promote forest sustainability, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through the maintenance of forest masses, human nutrition and health, economic development, conservation of biocultural heritages, women empowerment and hunger mitigation. We provide a worldwide review of the knowledge, biodiversity, novel approaches, future challenges and perspectives in the post-COVID era of this important genetic resource whose relevance has usually received marginal attention despite its strategic global significance. Summary: Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They have a paramount importance in nutrient cycling, plant protection against pathogens and abiotic stress, and establishment of underground networks that connect trees and other plants in nature, therefore being the wood wide web, the ‘internet’ of the forests. According to our literature review, globally 970 mycorrhizal fungal species (including both mushrooms and truffles) are edible, and they have enormous relevance either as a source of subsistence in low-income human groups around the world or as an important economic component whose international commerce is worth billions of American dollars annually. Since edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a non-timber forest product, their sustainable use and management is crucial in order to maintain forest stands and to provide well-being to the human communities surrounding the forested areas where they grow. In different parts of the world, different cultures have developed a traditional knowledge of EMF over millennia. Their knowledge might play an important role in food supply and food security in the future, hence contributing towards the “zero hunger” global goal. The biotechnological development of EMF has also been crucial in the establishment of plantations, or successful reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a worldwide review of how EMF might contribute to forest sustainability, food supply, biocultural conservation, and hunger and climate change mitigation is addressed by analysing the similarities, contrasts and challenges in all five continents. © 2021 The Authors.

Although FW is not a new concept, increasing concerns about chronic hunger, nutritional deficiency, food security, and sustainability have intensified attention on alternative and sustainable sources of protein for food and feed. Initiatives to extract and utilize protein from FW on a commercial scale have been undertaken, mainly in the developed countries, but they remain largely underutilized and generally suited for low-quality products. The current analysis reveals the extraction of protein from FW is a many-sided (complex) issue, and that identifies for a stronger and extensive integration of diverse extraction perspectives, focusing on nutritional quality, yield, and functionality of the isolated protein as a valued recycled ingredient. © 2021 The Authors.

As finance actors such as asset management firms, pension funds, private equity funds, state owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds engage in speculative farmland investment, commodity futures trading, and the conversion of farmland into a financial asset, power within agro-industrial food supply chains becomes increasingly concentrated. This has been associated with increased food prices and more processed food, contributing to obesogenic diets, hunger, and poorer health outcomes for many. The potential for negative social and environmental impacts has prompted awareness of the need for financial actors to demonstrate sustainability, responsibility and accountability in their farmland investments. METHODS: This paper uses thematic analysis of qualitative interviews and key documents to assess four recent acquisitions of sugarcane land in North Queensland. We consider how companies' efforts to establish or maintain a social license to operate (SLO) intersect with their capital accumulation strategies. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that the link between the commodification of 'unhealthy' food inputs (such as sugar) and financialisation remains outside the purview of financiers. Instead, agribusiness firms use narratives centred on biofuels investment and energy/food security to justify their legitimacy in the sugar sector. We organise our findings according to two 'narratives:' constructing trust and credibility through ethical compliance; and, biofuels expansion as a legitimate response to climate change. The concept of social license is much stronger in the second narrative, but health is largely missing. CONCLUSION: The 'distancing' between responsibility and health outcomes highlights the limits to principles of responsible financial investment, and to the legitimacy of finance to claim an SLO - the ongoing approval and acceptance by society to conduct its activities. © 2021 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

Many more have low-quality, unhealthy diets and micronutrient deficiencies leading to obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related non-communicable diseases. Additionally, current agro-food systems significantly impact the environment and the climate, including soil and water resources. Frequent natural disasters resulting from climate change, pandemics, and conflicts weaken food systems and exacerbate food insecurity worldwide. In this review, we outline the current knowledge in alternative agricultural practices for achieving sustainability as well as policies and practices that need to be implemented for an equitable distribution of resources and food for achieving several goals in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, animal husbandry, particularly ruminant meat and dairy, accounts for a significant proportion of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use but contributes only 18% of food energy. In contrast, plant-based foods, particularly perennial crops, have the lowest environmental impacts. Therefore, expanding the cultivation of perennials, particularly herbaceous perennials, to replace annual crops, fostering climate-smart food choices, implementing policies and subsidies favoring efficient production systems with low environmental impact, empowering women, and adopting modern biotechnological and digital solutions can help to transform global agro-food systems toward sustainability. There is growing evidence that food security and adequate nutrition for the global population can be achieved using climate-smart, sustainable agricultural practices, while reducing negative environmental impacts of agriculture, including GHG emissions. © 2022 by the authors."

Despite the huge abundance of natural resources in the IHR, the farmers still practice subsistence agriculture due to poor infrastructure, lack of facilities and vulnerability from natural disasters. The goals for no poverty and zero hunger specified in SDG 1 and SDG 2 can only be achieved by sustainable agriculture.

The role of livestock in supporting human well-being is especially contentious in discourses around sustainable diets. There is considerable variation in which environmental metrics are measured when describing sustainable diets, although some estimate of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different diets based on varying assumptions is commonplace. A market for animal-free and manufactured food items to substitute for animal source food (ASF) has emerged, driven by the high GHG emissions of ASF. Ingredients sourced from plants, and animal cells grown in culture are two approaches employed to produce alternative meats. These can be complemented with ingredients produced using synthetic biology. Alternative meat companies promise to reduce GHG, the land and water used for food production, and reduce or eliminate animal agriculture. Some CEOs have even claimed alternative meats will ‘end world hunger’. Rarely do such self-proclamations emanate from scientists, but rather from companies in their efforts to attract venture capital investment and market share. Such declarations are reminiscent of the early days of the biotechnology industry. At that time, special interest groups employed fear-based tactics to effectively turn public opinion against the use of genetic engineering to introduce sustainability traits, like disease resistance and nutrient fortification, into global genetic improvement programs. These same groups have recently turned their sights on the ‘unnaturalness’ and use of synthetic biology in the production of meat alternatives, leaving agriculturists in a quandary. Much of the rationale behind alternative meats invokes a simplistic narrative, with a primary focus on GHG emissions, ignoring the nutritional attributes and dietary importance of ASF, and livelihoods that are supported by grazing ruminant production systems. Diets with low GHG emissions are often described as sustainable, even though the nutritional, social and economic pillars of sustainability are not considered. Nutritionists, geneticists, and veterinarians have been extremely successful at developing new technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of ASF. Further technological developments are going to be requisite to continuously improve the efficiency of animal source, plant source, and cultured meat production. Perhaps there is an opportunity to collectively communicate how innovations are enabling both alternative- and conventional-meat producers to more sustainably meet future demand. This could counteract the possibility that special interest groups who promulgate misinformation, fear and uncertainty, will hinder the adoption of technological innovations to the ultimate detriment of global food security. © 2021 The Author(s)"

Another is to minimize hunger and food insecurity, with regard to equity. Firstly, we use Euclidean Metri and Complete Connection Method for cluster analysis according to the production efficiency and production structure of various foods. Then the countries are classified into countries with different production structures and productivity. Secondly, we quantified sustainability indicators to make standard deviations and risks to food production. Using models, principal component analysis, and factor analysis, we figure out how to distribute food among countries to maximize food productivity worldwide. Thirdly, the model is used to analyze the coefficient of food insecurity and the degree of hunger in each country, so as to obtain the utility level of food distribution in each country. The level of food utility in developed countries is relatively flat, while that in underdeveloped countries is steeper. So, the utility of food distribution in less developed countries is higher than that in developed countries. Therefore, when we measure the total utility of food, we multiply the utility difference of the insecurity factor by the quantity of food mixture and add the original food utility level to maximize the food utility level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Intensive farming systems and its variations, such as sustainable intensification or ecological intensification, are currently being pro-moted as technologies that can improve agricultural productivity and reduce environmental im-pacts. However, these are focused only on per-hectare productivity with growing negative impacts on local culture and the environment. This study identifies the negative impacts of crop-and live-stock-based farming systems on the Indo-Gangetic plains, as well as in the USA, China, and South America as an example of key challenges in global agriculture. These impacts are classified into environmental, social, economic, and health impacts. An alternative paradigm is proposed to over-come some of the shortcomings of current global agriculture. This new bottom-up paradigm is based on three indicators that are fundamental to achieve the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of agriculture and food systems. These are divided into technical, geographic, and social indicators and have been analysed for four farming systems—low-input, high-input, organic, and desired farming systems. Seven global geographic regions have been analysed in terms of their socio-economic indicators and status of agriculture in order to develop pathways for the implementation of the new paradigm. The pathway for change suggested in this paper includes a focus on research and training, policy and institutional changes, and an evaluation of the costs and benefits, and changes in production models that consider scale and sustainability metrics and include inno-vations in consultation with all stakeholders.

The comparison of these two situations shows that the current food system is seriously unfair. With the development at the expense of the natural environment, there is also uncertainty about whether people can enjoy food in a sustainable, healthy and safe way. Therefore, our group was asked to do some optimization research on the food system. In order to better simulate the operation of the food system. First of all, we design a food system model based on the system dynamics model, which includes four subsystems: economy and trade, environmental health, social production and politics. and the basic operation system of the system is formed on the basis of many variables in these four fields. Then, based on the variables in the grain system, we summarize four aspects of measuring the characteristics of the grain system, namely, profitability, efficiency, fairness and sustainability, and summarize 11 quantifiable evaluation system indicators. Then, the analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weight and evaluation function of each index in the comprehensive evaluation system. Finally, using the goal programming model, taking the fairness and sustainability indicators as constraints, the minimum value of the system comprehensive evaluation function is used to optimize the food system dynamics model.

Data sources explaining livelihood factors in informal settlements are scarce, and often highly disputed. In this study, Kibera is investigated, one of the largest informal settlements in Africa. The main aim is to analyze differences in livelihood factors across the villages in Kibera, and to explain some of the existing discrepancies in food security levels among its population. In particular, livelihood factors such as tribe, welfare and trust can explain some of the variation in food security across 12 of the 13 villages located in Kibera. The analyses inform of significant differences across the villages when it comes to, among others, income, food insecurity, ownership of land in rural areas, tribal background and trust levels in strangers and community leads.

The outcomes, findings and conclusions from 82 studies, published from 2010 onward, were considered as positive, negative, neutral or varied, and sometimes even contradicting, with regard to the contribution of palm cultivation and/or oil production to the achievement of a set of eight SDGs, selected to be those most related to socio-economic development, differentiating when possible between sustainable and conventional production. The results show that it is difficult to draw uniform views, highlighting the nuances and varied facets of the contribution of palm oil to the eight SDGs, some of which are inevitably interconnected. In general, it emerges that palm oil plays a crucial role in boosting the economy and livelihoods of local communities in many developing producer countries, substantially contributing to poverty reduction and to food security. However, the expansion of oil palm plantations has, in some cases, exacerbated social inequalities, and the economic growth generated by the palm oil production chain is not always accompanied by decent working conditions. Against this backdrop, the achievement of some SDGs is often facilitated by the implementation of sustainability certification schemes that play a key role in improving the socio-economic and environmental performance of palm oil production. This leads enhanced socio-economic livelihoods for the people living in the production areas in terms of working conditions, infrastructure, services and wages, with a consequent reduction of poverty rates, an increase in education quality, as well as better access to food and healthcare systems.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, sustainable agriculture, rural livelihood sustainability and food insecurity at household level are still of great concern and continue to be substantial challenges for the country's rural dwellers. While a framework for reform was developed to revitalize extension services in the country, the framework falls short in addressing gender issues in extension services. Given the significant role women play in agriculture in South Africa, this oversight compromises the effective attainment of the goals of extension. The review was undertaken to gain insight into the level of involvement of women as agricultural extension advisors and the challenges they face. Drawing from relevant published works, the paper examines the degree to which women and men jointly participate as extension advisors, with reference to South Africa. This paper argues that increased participation of women as extension advisors can help reposition agricultural extension to more effectively facilitate programs to deliver better and more direct impacts on reducing hunger and ensuring human nutrition and food security. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Aquaculture is one of the sources of food production, which can play a key role in fighting poverty and hunger. Sustainable aquaculture is strongly dependent on water quantity and quality, and also, optimal fish production can be determined by the physical, chemical and biological quality of water. Due to the current restrictions and the global increase in demand for aquatic products, unconventional waters (UWs) have been used in aquaculture. UWs include: recycled water, sewage, saline water, agricultural drains and water resulting from the process of sweetening and desalination of salty water. Today, these water resources have been used to grow all kinds of aquatic animals to provide food and protein. Considering the limited water resources in the world, the use of UWs is very effective and efficient in managing drought, and is considered as one of the ways to develop food production for humans. Due to its importance in areas facing water scarcity, the use of unconventional water resources (UWRs) to supplement or replace the use of conventional fresh water sources has been considered. In this review study, the importance of UWs and their sources, aquaculture products and aquatics that can be cultivated with the help of UWs are discussed.  © 2022 Mojtaba Soleimani-Sardo et al., published by Sciendo."

Whilst research has been conducted regarding nutritional education in other con-texts, such as schools and community organisations, to the authors’ knowledge, no published research has yet explored nutritional education within HAF. The current study therefore aimed to explore the implementation, delivery, and perceived facilitators, barriers and impacts of nutritional education across a number of Local Authorities delivering HAF in England. Purposive sampling (n = 11) was used to recruit HAF leads involved in nutritional education, to participate in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis showed that nutritional education is currently delivered through a variety of modes including face-to-face, online, and take-home methods, all of which require a range of considerations in terms of implementation, delivery, and associated impacts, with some holiday clubs offering no nutritional education. According to participating HAF leads, nutritional education was used as a mechanism to enhance children’s and parents’ cooking confidence and competence, to improve dietary intake, and to increase understanding of issues such as food sustainability, environmental impacts, and food provenance. Although there are many examples of innovative practice, the findings suggested that COVID guidelines proved challenging for providers to include nutritional education within HAF delivery during 2021. Further, whilst the quality standards framework for nutritional education provides flexibility in terms of implementation and delivery, specific guidance, and monitoring of provision is required to ensure quality assurance and consistency across the HAF programme. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet, the role of transition to sustainable agri-food systems (SAFSs) and its potential contribution to food security in these nations is rarely discussed. This chapter analyzes the transition to SAFSs in the Egyptian context, with a specific focus on organic agriculture, and its implications for food security. Qualitative data were collected through a systematic review and analyzed using the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP; socio-technical landscape, socio-technical regime, and niche). Results reveal that organic agriculture is a prominent niche for transition to SAFSs that can mitigate Egypt's socio-economic and environmental problems in the long run (e.g. global warming, water scarcity, health issues, poverty, unemployment, population growth). However, the dominant system is intensive, irrigated agriculture that is characterized by high use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Landscape elements are projected to put a strain on the agri-food regime while also creating a possibility for the development of diverse sustainable niches. The implications of this transformation on food security dimensions (viz. availability, accessibility, utilization, stability) seem rather mixed. Therefore, political support, physical and institutional infrastructure improvement, technology transfer, and awareness-raising are all essential to achieve sustainable food security and zero hunger in Egypt. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

From a historical point of view, the Green Revolution, together with biofortification and sustainable intensification, was established as a possible solution to counter hunger and malnutrition during the second half of the 20th century. As a solution, to overcome the limitations attributed to the Green Revolution, food supply chains were developed. The current food system, based on the long food supply chain (LFSC), is characterized by globalization, promoting several advantages for both producers and consumers. However, LFSC has been demonstrated to be unable to feed the global population and, furthermore, it generates negative ecological, environmental, logistical, and nutritional pressures. Thus, novel efficient food systems are required to respond to current environmental and consumers’ demands, as is the case of short food supply chain (SFSC). As a recently emerging food system, the evaluation of SFSC sustainability in terms of environmental, economic, and social assessment is yet to be determined. This review is focused on the evolution of food supply systems, starting from the Green Revolution to food supply chains, providing a significant perspective on sustainability. © 2022 The Authors.

However, these action regulations have caused substantial challenges to livelihoods. We explored the perceptions and experiences of COVID‐19 implications for urban informal food traders in South Africa during the initial lockdown period that lasted five weeks. A rapid qualitative study was conducted during October–November 2020. Twelve key informants (seven men and five women) categorized into informal traders and food system expert groups were interviewed. Data were analyzed thematically using MAXQDA soft-ware. Participants perceived informal trading as a main source of livelihood for many individuals. Negative lockdown impacts described included forced business closure, increased food costs and reduced demand. The consensus among participants was that the government’s lack of formal recognition for informal food traders pre‐COVID‐19 contributed to challenges they faced during the pandemic, as evidenced by their exclusion as “essential service providers’’ at the start of lock-down. Policies that fail to recognize and consider informal food traders during ‘normal’ times lead to widened social inequality gaps among already vulnerable groups during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. In the case of COVID‐19 in South Africa, this caused severe hunger, food insecurity and income loss. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Total fish catch increased substantially in recent decades, while CPUE fluctuates and declined between 1999/2000 and 2010. Many fisheries are exploited or overexploited and market sellers commonly do not have access to enough fish. Exports are consistently low.

Phosphorus availability is one of the major barriers to this due to low historical agricultural use. Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) indicate that only a sustainable (SSP1) or a fossil fuelled future (SSP5) can improve food security (in terms of price, availability, and risk of hunger) whilst nationalistic (SSP3) and unequal (SSP4) pathways worsen food security. Furthermore, sustainable SSP1 requires limited cropland expansion and low phosphorus use whilst the nationalistic SSP3 is as environmentally damaging as the fossil fuelled pathway. The middle of the road future (SSP2) maintains today’s inadequate food security levels only by using approximately 440 million tonnes of phosphate rock. Whilst this is within the current global reserve estimates the market price alone for a commonly used fertiliser (DAP) would cost US$ 130 ± 25 billion for agriculture over the period 2020 to 2050 and the farmgate price could be two to five times higher due to additional costs (e.g. transport, taxation etc.).

Furthermore, the colorful pigments of microalgae can act as antioxidants together with many other health-improving properties as well as a natural colorant. In addition, the supplementation of algae as animal feed provides plentiful benefits, such as improved growth and body weight, reduced feed intake, enhanced immune response and durability towards illness, antibacterial and antiviral action as well as enrichment of livestock products with bioactive compounds.

Food security is perhaps the most debated sustainability impact of biofuels, especially in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa that experience high rates of malnutrition and have been a major destination for biofuel-related investments. This study assesses the local food security impacts of engagement in biofuel crop production using a consistent protocol between multiple crops and sites. We use standardized metrics of food security related to dietary diversity and perceptions of hunger, and focus on feedstock smallholders and plantation workers in four operational projects: a large-scale jatropha plantation (Mozambique), a smallholder-based jatropha project (Malawi) and two hybrid sugarcane projects (Malawi, Eswatini). Collectively these reflect the main feedstocks, modes of production and land use transitions related to biofuel projects in Sub-Sahara Africa. Inverse Probability Weighting analysis indicates that involvement in sugarcane production improved household food security for plantation workers and feedstock smallholders. Conversely, involvement in jatropha production does not have a statistically significant positive effect on household food security for both workers and smallholders. Regression models indicate that the factors driving food security indicator levels vary between study sites. Wealth indicators influence food security indicators in several sites, but the absolute level of income plays a smaller role, while income stability/regularity, access to credit and stable markets for selling sugarcane be important drivers as indicated by the strong effect of proxy variables on indicators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

In understanding societal challenges involving adequate nutrition and abolishment of hunger and disease, linkages are being sought between a research agenda and sustainable development that promote the cooperation of communities. The small-scale livestock producers have struggled with sustaining their productivity amidst food-borne neglected tropical diseases, poor husbandry systems, and modernization of traditional ways of rearing their livestock on one hand, and on the other, ensuring a sustainable livelihood and feeding people. While widespread traditional pig production continues to be the hallmark of resiliency in providing livelihoods of the rural population, existing production challenges require an improvement in ways of raising indigenous pigs in averting hunger, and where applicable, taking advantage of IK and associated methodologies. Efforts aimed at replacing indigenous breeds with unsuitable exotic breeds or crossbreeding have had mixed results as the farmers and their communities believe their indigenous ways still have a place in the sustainability of the enterprises. Striking a balance between the adoption of modernized animal livestock practices and its potential for increased productivity and disease control strategies, and taking into consideration experiences, and practices that, if desirable to fight hunger, can encourage communities to take research outcomes seriously. Such adoptions may lead to sustainable initiatives that are locally driven. While the fight against hunger may be the focus of SDG #2, the SDGs will remain integrated in terms of neglected tropical diseases. This is because any action done to achieve any of them, particularly SDG 1 “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” and SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” affects outcomes in others. To achieve any meaningful progress, any development must balance aspects of social, economic, and environmental sustainability.

Findings indicate that weak economic growth, gender inequality, high inflation, low crop productivity, low investment in irrigated agriculture and research, climate change, high population growth, poor policy frameworks, weak infrastructural development, and corruption are the major hurdles in the sustaining food security in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Globally, billions of people, particularly in developing nations, have limited access to nutritional supplements and fortified foods, subsequently suffering from micronutrient deficiency leading to a range of health issues. The green revolution enhanced crop production and provided food to billions of people but often falls short with respect to the nutritional quality of that food. Plants may assimilate nutrients from synthetic chemical fertilizers, but this approach generally has low nutrient delivery and use efficiency. Further, the overexposure of chemical fertilizers may increase the risk of neoplastic diseases, render food crops unfit for consumption and cause environmental degradation. Therefore, to address these challenges, more research is needed for sustainable crop yield and quality enhancement with minimum use of chemical fertilizers. Complex nutritional disorders and ‘hidden hunger’ can be addressed through biofortification of food crops.

Students explore different aspects of food security in domestic and international settings through asynchronous modules before being tasked in the creation of an individual action plan to address the issue of food security in a designated target audience. Students work independently on the action plans culminating their learning with an impact report presentation to the class community. The authenticity of the learning experience is increased by harnessing the power of student autonomy and student voice in crafting the application of course content knowledge.

Methods: Current systematic reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines, and other relevant articles on the topics of nutrition and physical activity in young children (aged 1–3 years), were reviewed by representatives of the professional societies and institutions of the network. They evaluated the scientific evidence and updated the existing recommendations or formulated recommendations for action on some issues for the first time. Sustainability aspects were also taken into account. The process was coordinated by the Healthy Start—Young Family Network. Recommendations: Small children should have regular mealtimes. They should participate in family meals and eat with other family members as often as possible. Attention to the child’s hunger and satiety signals (responsive feeding) contributes to the development of healthy eating habits. Food should not be used as a reward or punishment. The recommended infant diet includes plenty of plant foods and moderate amounts of animal foods. A vegetarian diet must be carefully matched to the child’s nutritional needs. Young children should be physically active as much as possible, especially outside and in a variety of ways. Parents should support physical activity. Screen devices are not recommended for young children. Parents should provide the child with opportunities for regular rest and sleep. Professionals and families should explore together ways to implement these recommendations in everyday family life. © 2022, BLE / www.gesund-ins-leben.de."

Cassava's edible storage roots act as a critical staple food for over 180 million Nigerians. Micronutrient deficiency presents a major public health issue in Nigeria and correlates with cassava consumption level across six-agro-ecological zones within the country. Though high in caloric value, cassava roots are deficient in minerals, placing populations that rely on this crop at risk of hidden hunger. Micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron and zinc, affect an estimated 6 million children in Nigeria under five years of age. Supplementation, fortification and food-based diversification are being employed to tackle micronutrient deficiencies. However, in order to achieve wider impact and sustainability, biofortification of staple foods such as cassava is also being explored. Conventional breeding of cassava is unlikely to achieve elevated storage root mineral content at nutritionally significant levels due to lack of genetic diversity for these traits within the existing germplasm. Biofortification by genetic modification provides a potential solution to this challenge. Proof of concept has demonstrated that transgenic biofortification is a reality and can produce foodstuffs with increased mineral content that could beneficially impact the health of consumers in Nigeria and elsewhere.

Environmentally and financially, it represents a waste of natural resources and increases the cost respectively. Socially, it represents an ethical issue as about 800 million people are suffering from hunger worldwide. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore if and how resilience contributes to food waste reduction in fruits and vegetables distribution in the Brazilian market. Multiple case studies were conducted in the supplier-retailer dyad of four retail chains. Results have shown that resilience plays the role of both enabler and barrier to food waste reduction. On the positive side, collaboration, communication, flexibility, innovation, knowledge management, leadership, security technologies and supply chain design contributed to food waste reduction; especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the negative side, financial health and redundancy increased the level of food waste. Additionally, it was observed that flexibility can reduce or increase food waste. Our findings have implications for academics and practitioners as the developed framework summarizes the role of resilience to food waste reduction. As a social impact, the implementation of food waste reduction initiatives by non-governmental organizations and retailer associations can result in increased communication, knowledge diffusion, and training about how to build resilience and improve food waste reduction practices among different agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that explores the relationship among elements of resilience and food waste. Thus, it advances the current literature by operationalizing resilience to reduce food waste. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Globally, food security offers challenges both from achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets and the welfare perspective of many poor households. As a result, this study is guided by Neo Malthusian and Access theories to investigate Food Security Sustainability: a Synthesis of the Current Concepts and Empirical Approaches for Meeting SDGs in Nigeria using ARDL and ECM techniques. The ARDL revealed that agricultural value-added and GDP positively affect food security for commercial agrarian investments in Nigeria. However, internal displacement, population growth, food inflation, and exchange rate volatility negatively affect sustainable food security in Nigeria. The model’s coefficient of ECMt−1 also shows negative (−0.0130 approximately) and statistically significant (0.0000) at 1%. Thus, the speed of adjustment requires 1.3% annually for the long-run equilibrium convergence to be restored. The study concludes that the SDGs targets for poverty and hunger reduction, mainly for food security sustainability alongside small producers by the year 2030, can be rarely achieved because the convergence to equilibrium is more than nine years. An active value-addition strategy for sustainable food security and the provision of humanitarian interventions are recommended. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture. © 2021 by the authors.

Lebanon, a country that has been suffering from multiple unfortunate events for decades now is at a disadvantage when it comes to standing up against food insecurity. According to the World Bank, the Lebanon crisis is classified as one of the “top 10 most severe crises globally since the 19th century”. Many barriers need to be surmounted to reach food security in the country, and since it is a land highly dependent on the importation of food, the number of factors influencing the narrative of the fight against hunger is multiplied. With the Ukraine-Russia war, Lebanon's wheat reserve has been drastically impacted, an alarming issue that requires urgent remedy otherwise basic food unavailability can be further threatened. Many efforts have been made by international bodies, the state, national communities, social groups, and initiatives to help save the country. The increase in the gap between the values of the Lebanese Pound and the United States Dollar, the corruption of the state, and many other factors cause Lebanon's survival to be highly dependent on its allies and global donations. In this article, we will discuss the barriers to food security and sustainability in Lebanon and their burden on the country.

The blends were: mogroside V and stevia RebM; stevia RebA and thaumatin; and sucralose and acesulfame-potassium (ace-K). At each 4 h visit, 60 healthy volunteers (53% male; all with overweight/obesity) consumed a 330 mL beverage with either an S&SE blend (0 kJ) or 8% sucrose (26 g, 442 kJ), shortly followed by a standardised breakfast (∼2600 or 1800 kJ with 77 or 51 g carbohydrates, depending on sex). All blends reduced the 2-h incremental area-under-the-curve (iAUC) for blood insulin (p < 0.001 in mixed-effects models), while the stevia RebA and sucralose blends reduced the glucose iAUC (p < 0.05) compared with sucrose. Post-prandial levels of triglycerides plus hepatic transaminases did not differ across conditions (p > 0.05 for all). Compared with sucrose, there was a 3% increase in LDL-cholesterol after stevia RebA-thaumatin (p < 0.001 in adjusted models); and a 2% decrease in HDL-cholesterol after sucralose-ace-K (p < 0.01). There was an impact of blend on fullness and desire to eat ratings (both p < 0.05) and sucralose-acesulfame K induced higher prospective intake vs sucrose (p < 0.001 in adjusted models), but changes were of a small magnitude and did not translate into energy intake differences over the next 24 h.

Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021 were used to detect the changes and identify how anthropogenic activities have altered the land cover and land use and impede the sustainability of agriculture. Terra MODIS vegetation indices from 2000 to 2020 were used to detect waterlogging. Soil salinity was measured from the soil samples and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) from Landsat images. Findings of the study revealed that agricultural lands have decreased because of an increase in shrimp farming. Waterlogging and soil salinity are increasing due to increased shrimp farms also for poor drainage infrastructure and human modification.

However, their production has negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Certification standards have been promoted as a market-led mechanism to ensure their sustainable production. Even though food security does not feature in the theory of change of most certification standards, there are interesting intersections. This paper assesses the food security outcomes of certification adoption among cocoa and oil palm smallholders in Ghana. We analyse 608 household surveys from two study sites using propensity score matching and multiple standardized metrics of food security such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS), the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and the Coping Strategies Index. Certified cocoa/oil palm farmers are more food secure than uncertified farmers and food crop farmers across most indicators and group comparisons. However, the differences are for most indicators not substantial or statistically significant (except the HFIAS). In fact, 65% and 68% of the certified cocoa and oil palm farmers are vulnerable to food insecurity in terms of the FCS. These results suggest that even though certification adoption can improve the livelihoods and yields of farmers, in reality it has marginal effect on food security. Certification standards would need to emphasize food security in their guidelines, theories of change and support packages to smallholders if they are to enhance food security and have a truly positive effect on the sustainability of cocoa and oil palm production. © 2021 The Author(s).

It distinguishes between injunctive and descriptive social norms, as well as between reported actual choice and intended future choice. The study uses binary logistic regression models and survey data (N = 348) from five workplace restaurants in Helsinki, Finland where a novel, local and environmentally friendly dish, roach fish patties, was being launched. Workplace restaurants account for a significant share of food consumption in Finland and are a relevant context for investigating the impact of social norms as the food choice is highly observable. The study reveals that perceived descriptive norms are significantly associated with both actual and intended food choice while perceived injunctive social norms are not related to either. It also finds that in the case of actual choice, the impact of perceived descriptive norms is weaker compared to that of other motives, such as habit, visual appeal, value for money, and ability to satiate hunger. In the case of intended choice, only taste has a stronger impact than the descriptive norm. Further, the analysis situates the motives for food choice in the larger theoretical discussion of System 1 and 2 decision processes and of the impact of visceral factors on food choice, and finds that visceral-factor-related motives have a stronger impact on actual choice than on intended choice. The study shows how the role of social norms in sustainable food choice is more nuanced than presented in previous literature.

Amongst SSFs landed catches, approximately 95% are consumed domestically. Taken together, these highlight the importance of the potential for SSFs to contribute to food security and well-being of coastal populations, particularly in Developing Economy Countries (DECs). We used the Sea Around Us database to evaluate long-term trends of marine SSFs landed catches in 85 DECs. We analyse whether yields from SSFs have the capacity to provide the coastal populations of DECs with a recommended annual intake (RAI) of 10.6 kg of fish per person, and how that capacity has changed over the period of 1960 to 2016. We show that landed catches of SSFs increased in the majority of DECs evaluated from 1950 to 2016. However, in 2016, over one-third of SSFs in DECs assessed did not have the capacity to provide the RAI of fish to coastal communities, and 64% of all SSFs assessed are exhibiting significant declines in their capacity to fulfil this need. Regional trends in providing RAI were highly variable, putting the long-term sustainability and capacity of SSFs to contribute meaningfully to food security in doubt. This study demonstrates that landed catches of SSFs alone are not a useful proxy for food security.

Food loss and waste are linked to environmental deterioration, economic loss, and an increase in hunger. Therefore, the food industry requires sustainable consumption and production (SCP) to reduce losses and waste. The circular economy (CE) concept has become a popular strategy for reducing food waste and boosting sustainability. Therefore, with efficient reverse logistics in the FSC, food producers can help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) like SCP and zero hunger. In literature, minimal research has been available in identifying the CE adoption challenges in FSC. This research identifies 15 critical challenges from the literature and discussion with the panel of experts. The relationship between the challenges has been established through an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique. The challenges were characterized in cause–effect according to their relational intensity obtained using the grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. Grey's relational theory is applied in DEMATEL to minimize uncertainty and vagueness of the expert judgment. The findings of this study suggest that creating policy from the government, providing incentives, and strictly enforcing environmental regulations are the most critical challenge. Hence, by focusing on the above, the effective adoption of the CE principle is achieved. This result also suggests that by addressing the challenges of CE, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be performed.

Recognizing the issue, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 mandates reducing global food waste by 50 percent by 2030. This situation has also given impetus to academic research on consumer food waste in both household and out-of-home settings. However, food delivery apps (FDAs) remain under-researched from this perspective. This is a serious gap because operating under a business model that inherently facilitates food over-ordering, FDAs can be a major source of food waste. Understanding the demand-side factors that drive consumers to order more food than required to satiate their hunger can be useful in mitigating such wasteful indulgences. Noting this, we extend the seminal theory of planned behavior (TPB) to propose direct and intervening mechanisms that can better explicate why consumers indulge in a ‘shopping routine’ of ordering more food than required. We analyzed data from 487 FDA users to test the proposed hypotheses. Our results reveal the positive associations of (a) attitude and subjective norms with usage intentions and (b) trust, intentions, and leftover reuse routine with shopping routine. In addition, both proposed moderators—i.e., willingness to pay for eco-friendly packaging and number of years of FDA usage—do, in fact, moderate the associations of leftover reuse routine with both usage intentions and shopping routine. These findings can help marketers and policymakers devise appropriate strategies to promote pro-environmental green behaviors among FDA users without harming the commercial interests of the sector. © 2022 The Authors"

Nearly a billion people still live in poverty, the majority of whom happen to be in developing countries, with a larger share of those who are poor living on marginal lands. Food insecurity is a vicious reality in the everyday lives of these marginalized poor, and the threat of food insecurity and hunger is becoming even more serious and imminent, with increasing trends in population growth. Climate change is expected to add yet more weight to this equation and to pose greater risks for the livelihoods of these communities. In spite of the challenges faced, addressing marginal agriculture systems and poverty is vital to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we investigate the historical policy perspective towards marginal areas to pinpoint potential shortcomings in the policy environment. Subsequently, we present a roadmap to future research engagement and develop a policy framework, with instruments and strategies focusing on the food–poverty–environment nexus, to target poverty reduction, preserve biodiversity, and restore marginal lands. Our analysis of historical policies reveals that conventional policy approaches towards marginal agriculture have been conducive to favorable areas (specific to input-responsive crops only), neglecting marginal areas. Future policies to address the food–poverty–environment nexus within marginal environments must evolve around a framework that is all-inclusive but context-specific. Agricultural and other public investments should be prioritized geographically in accordance with the characteristics of marginality hotspots. Policy instruments should encourage long-term solutions to enhance productivity through regenerative production systems and preserve the environmental resource base. © 2021 by the authors.

In doing so, we assessed the actual benefits and synergies of reducing carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF), and ecological footprint (EF) and improving health and respecting dietary acceptance under the corresponding scenarios. The results show that CF, WF and EF can be reduced by up to 19%, 15% and 30% respectively, while satisfying nutritional constraints and achieving the minimum deviation from the current food combination.

The following concepts include integrated management of water basins or continued sustainable development of water basins. Although there are not a lot of underdeveloped water basins, there have been 150 years of dam development. Dams prevent sediment from moving continuously down rivers by trapping it in reservoirs, which reduces the storage capacity and useable life of the reservoirs and prevents downstream reaches of materials necessary for channel form and aquatic ecosystems. Restricted availability of hydrological and geomorphological data hinders current knowledge of sediment characteristics and dynamics, which affects prediction models required for management. This research tested current models for estimating sediment output and transport based on data mining categorization and prediction approaches and assessed their applicability. This work brings together experience from five continents in controlling reservoir sediments and reducing downstream sediment famine of data on the distribution of sediment particle sizes, and manning's roughness coefficient were shown to have the largest influences on the predicted sediment load. Additionally, parameter uncertainty for river geometry and water flow almost doubled, underlining the fact that more knowledge of these variables might significantly enhance our ability to forecast and control present and future sediment dynamics in the river basin. © 2022"

The continued vitality of agricultural systems depends on economic conditions that support farmers’ livelihoods. Exploring the long-term effects of adaptations requires modeling agricultural and economic conditions to engage stakeholders upon whom the burden of any adaptation will rest. Here, we use a new freeware model FEWCalc (Food-Energy-Water Calculator) to project farm incomes based on climate, crop selection, irrigation practices, water availability, and economic adaptation of adding renewable energy production. Thus, FEWCalc addresses United Nations Global Sustainability Goals No Hunger and Affordable and Clean Energy. Here, future climate scenario impacts on crop production and farm incomes are simulated when current agricultural practices continue so that no agricultural adaptations are enabled. The model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) with added arid-region dynamics is used to simulate agricultural dynamics. Demonstrations at a site in the midwest USA with 2008–2017 historical data and two 2018–2098 RCP climate scenarios provide an initial quantification of increased agricultural challenges under climate change, such as reduced crop yields and increased financial losses. Results show how this finding is largely driven by increasing temperatures and changed distribution of precipitation throughout the year. Without effective technological advances and operational and policy changes, the simulations show how rural areas could increasingly depend economically on local renewable energy, while agricultural production from arid regions declines by 50% or more. © 2020"

This disease is endemic and it will contribute to the loss of work efficiency in draught animals in developing countries and sanctions on exports of animals and animal products. Thus, this study is to identify the most observed FMD symptoms among cattle by farmers in Peninsular Malaysia. By including six states in Peninsular Malaysia, face-to-face interviews were conducted among 349 cattle farmers from April and October 2018. Using descriptive analysis, result demonstrated that the main FMD symptom observed by farmers of their cattle in Peninsular Malaysia was drooling (95.4.%), a loss of appetite (77.7%) and blisters on tongue, lips, mammary glands and around mouth and hoof (67.9%). As the FMD is one of the most highly infectious diseases among cattle, learning of the FMD symptoms earlier, will assist the cattle farmer to take fast effective action to reduce the spread and impact of FMD outbreaks.

Securing and managing soil nutrients remains one of the most basic challenges to growing adequate food while simultaneously protecting biodiversity and the integrity of ecosystems. To achieve these objectives, it is increasingly clear that the management of ecological processes will need to supplant reliance on non-renewable and environmentally damaging inputs. In recent years, progress has been made in developing perennial grain crops that show promise to improve on a range of ecological functions such as efficient nitrogen cycling and soil carbon accretion that tend to be well-developed in natural ecosystems but become compromised following land conversion to row crop agriculture. Here we report on a multi-faceted, 5-year experiment in which intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) (Thinopyrum intermedium), a perennial relative of wheat that is bred to produce the grain Kernza®, was intercropped in alternating rows with the perennial legume alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The performance of the unfertilized intercrop was compared to monocropped IWG treatments, with and without urea-N applications, planted at two row densities such that the intercrop could be interpreted as either an addition or substitution design. Comparisons of relative IWG yields (RYs) in the intercrop with unfertilized monocrops suggest net competitive interactions between alfalfa and IWG in the establishment year, followed by increasing degrees of facilitation over the next 4 years. Evidence from N fertilizer responsiveness, SPAD readings, net N mineralization assays, and N balance calculations suggest that alfalfa contributed to an aggrading pool of soil organic nitrogen over the course of the experiment. Comparisons of grain RYs of intercropped IWG and fertilized IWG monocultures suggest N-limitation in the first half of the experiment, and N sufficiency in the second half. Grain yields in the intercrop did not decline significantly over 5 years in contrast to all IWG monocrop treatments that did significantly decline. This study contributes to a growing literature on approaches to ecological nutrient management that incorporate diversity and perenniality to increase food security and resilience.

Aquaculture now provides >50% of the global seafood supply, a share that is expected to increase to at least 60% within the next decade. Aquaculture is an important tool for reducing resource consumption in global protein production and increasing resilience to climate change and other global disruptions (i.e. pandemics, geo-political instability). Importantly, blue foods also provide essential nutrition for a growing human population. Blue foods are helping to help the global goal of ‘zero hunger’ (United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 2) while reducing the dependency on finite natural resources but further refinement and new solutions are needed to make the industry more ‘circular’ and sustainable, particularly with respect to sourcing raw materials for aquafeeds.

Biotechnological interventions may become highly important in reducing plants’ drought stress in order to address key plant challenges such as population growth and climate change. Abstract: Drought is a multidimensional construct with several triggering mechanisms or contributing factors working at various spatiotemporal scales, making it one of the known natural catastrophes. Drought is among the causes of hunger and malnutrition, decreasing agricultural output, and poor nutrition. Many deaths caused in children are due to hunger situations, and one in four children face stunted growth. All this hunger and malnutrition may be responsible for the reduction in agricultural productivity caused due to the drought situations affecting food security. Global Hunger Index has been accelerating due to under-nutrition and under-5 deaths. Drought has been covering more than 20% of the world's agricultural areas, leading to significantly less food production than what is required for consumption. Drought reduces soil fertility and adversely affects soil biological activity reducing the inherent capacity of the soil to support vegetation. Recent droughts have had a much greater effect on people’s lives, even beyond causing poverty and hunger. Drought may have substantial financial consequences across the globe it may cause a severe impact on the world economy. It is a natural feature of the environment that will appear and disappear as it has in history. Due to increasing temperatures and growing vulnerabilities, it will undoubtedly occur more often and seriously in the coming years. To ensure sustainable socio-economic and social development, it is critical to reducing the effects of potential droughts worldwide using different biotechnological interventions. It’s part of a long-term growth plan, and forecasting is essential for early warnings and global hunger management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study developed a sustainable performance assessment (SPA) framework through integrated triple bottom line (TBL) and circular economy practice. The weights of sustainable dimensions and key performance indicators (KPIs) have been determined using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP). A fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (F-TOPSIS) has been used to evaluate sustainable performance and rank the alternatives. A total of 16 KPIs were used to develop the framework drawn from literature and experts' opinions. Food quality, revenue growth, and resource utilization are the top three KPIs obtained from F-AHP. The economic factors have the highest weights (0.4), followed by the environment (0.34), circulation (0.16), and social dimensions (0.1). Food quality is ranked first with a weight of 0.16, and human resources are ranked 16th with a weight of 0.01.

Biofortification, which is a process of breeding staple crops with improved micronutrient contents such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc, offers a cost‐effective and sustainable solution in reducing hidden hunger. However, the success of these foods depends on consumer acceptance. In contrast to previous studies, this research focuses on the mechanism of consumer acceptance of biofortified crops that undergo physical changes (i.e., changes in appearance) after biofortification. We use data on 473 Chinese consumers collected through online surveys to examine their purchase intentions for biofortified foods that have visible (vs. invisible) nutrition traits. Using two online surveys, we conduct two studies to reveal the mechanism and antecedents of consumer acceptance of different biofortified foods. In Study 1, we find that consumer purchase intentions vary depending upon the visibility of nutrition traits in biofortified foods. Specifically, consumers exhibit a nutrition‐related food neophobia (NFN) regardless of visibility of the nutrition trait in biofortified foods; and a sensory‐affective food neophobia (SFN) which is only pronounced when the nutrition trait in biofortified foods is visible. The results of the mediation analysis show that for both types of biofortified foods, NFN mediates consumers’ purchasing intentions. For foods that involve visible changes after biofortification, SFN acts as an additional mediator of consumer purchase intentions. Using ordered logistic regression analysis, we find that both food neophobias have a negative impact on consumer acceptance of biofortified foods. The results of Study 2 confirm our findings and further show that nutrition information moderates the mediation of NFN and SFN, i.e., the negative impact of NFN and SFN on purchase intentions can be reduced by providing nutrition information to consumers. The results of this study have several theoretical and practical implications and are of interest to stakeholders and marketers in the promotion of biofortified foods. © 2021 by the authors.

SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, China and spread to other countries and continents causing a variety of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms which led to death in severe cases. Scope and approach: In this review, we discuss and analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal production systems and food production of meat, dairy, eggs, and processed food, in addition to assessing the impact of the pandemic on animal healthcare systems, animal healthcare quality, animal welfare, food chain sustainability, and the global economy. We also provide effective recommendations to animal producers, veterinary healthcare professionals, workers in animal products industries, and governments to alleviate the effects of the pandemic on livestock farming and production systems. Key findings and conclusions: Port restrictions, border restrictions, curfews, and social distancing limitations led to reduced quality, productivity, and competitiveness of key productive sectors. The restrictions have hit the livestock sector hard by disrupting the animal feed supply chain, reducing animal farming services, limiting animal health services including delays in diagnosis and treatment of diseases, limiting access to markets and consumers, and reducing labor-force participation. The inhumane culling of animals jeopardized animal welfare. Egg smashing, milk dumping, and other animal product disruptions negatively impacted food production, consumption, and access to food originating from animals. In summary, COVID-19 triggered lockdowns and limitations on local and international trade have taken their toll on food production, animal production, and animal health and welfare.

Its implementation can enhance resource securities and sustainable development. Despite its potential, full adoption of the approach has been hindered by a lack of actionable strategies to guide its practical application. This is attributed to (i) poor data (ii) lack of empirical evidence, (iii) inadequate analytical tools, and (iv) lack of clarity on applicable spatial scale. This study undertook a literature review, coupled with systemic analyses of a WEF nexus analytical model, whose outputs were used as a basis to develop a Theory of Change, an iterative outline for operationalising the approach in the context of southern Africa. The consultative and iterative Theory of Change culminated with the formulation of pathways to (i) overcome the barriers impeding WEF nexus operationalisation, (ii) mitigation of trade-offs while enhancing synergies towards attaining simultaneous resource securities, (iii) poverty alleviation and reduction of inequalities, and (iv) reconciling policy with implementation scale.

Challenges with respect to postharvest practices are further complicated by well-known facts that small-scale fisheries suffer from lack of voice, vulnerability, contributions being undervalued or not valued at all, rural driving and being far from markets, and a host of issues. In most context the operators have low financial capabilities and are not able to access sustainable solutions to solving postharvest extant limitations confronting their operations and working technological packages. This chapter appraises the types and forms of postharvest practices and limitations to adopting what works in small-scale fisheries postharvest ways. Our chapter noted that postharvest activities remain critical to eliminating hunger and the midpoints between field harvest and consumption in the fisheries value chain. New recommendations were offered with the hope of influencing policy changes required in achieving sustainable postharvest practices in small-scale fisheries and increasing food and nutritional security. Recommendations were offered, especially the need to implement the SSF Guidelines toward a sustainable postharvest approach. The sustainable postharvest system is pertinent to attaining many of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 1, 2, and 12. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

While the production of ethanol has existed for several millennia and can be considered a product of Industrial Biotechnology, the application of complex and engineered biocatalysts to produce industrial scale products with acceptable economics is only a few decades old. Bioethanol as fuel, lactic acid as food and PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (PHA) as a processible material are some examples of products derived from Industrial Biotechnology. Purpose and Scope: Industrial Biotechnology is the sector of biotechnology that holds the most promise in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental degradation caused by pollution, since all products that are made today from fossil carbon feedstocks could be manufactured using Industrial Biotechnology - renewable carbon feedstocks and biocatalysts. To match the economics of fossil-based bulk products, Industrial Biotechnology-based processes must be sufficiently robust. This aspect continues to evolve with increased technological capabilities to engineer biocatalysts (including microorganisms) and the decreasing relative price difference between renewable and fossil carbon feedstocks. While there have been major successes in manufacturing products from Industrial Biotechnology, challenges exist, although its promise is real. Here, PHA biopolymers are a class of product that is fulfilling this promise. Summary and Conclusion: The authors illustrate the benefits and challenges of Industrial Biotechnology, the circularity and sustainability of such processes, its role in reducing supply chain issues, and alleviating societal problems like poverty and hunger. With increasing awareness among the general public and policy makers of the dangers posed by climate change, pollution and persistent societal issues, Industrial Biotechnology holds the promise of solving these major problems and is poised for a transformative upswing in the manufacture of bulk chemicals and materials from renewable feedstocks and biocatalysts.  © 2022 Anindya Mukherjee et al., published by Sciendo."

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the food issue became more intense, serious, and evident. Hunger demands urgent actions. Obesity levels have been raised and are removing health and quality of life from the population. Production planting practices and the food supply chain are not necessarily ecologically friendly. Sustainability issues greatly intensify social problems. As well as food loss (FL), food waste (FW), and sustainability concerns, obesity, and malnutrition are enhanced due to the lack of knowledge by the population. Processed food (PF), packaging, and additives, despite still needing improvement, are essential to food security control. Nowadays, hunger is not due to insufficient agricultural practices but rather to inequality and absence of adequate public policies. In the context of a certain abundance of food production and processing, the hunger scenario in contrast to FLW is an ethical, social, moral, and sustainable issue. In this context, a Food-Based Dietary Guideline (FBDG) can be an important public policy tool from the health, nutrition, environmental, and educational points of view. Despite the effort, the literature shows that FBDGs can be better used to fulfill healthiness and sustainability purposes. In this scenario, the elaboration/revision of the FBDG, adopting a clearer, simpler, and a better-suited communication strategy is essential. In this way, this article discusses the importance of the FBDG as a public policy tool, not only regarding health issues but also communication strategies, production sustainability, and humanitarian ones, which are crucial to FBDG's efficiency.

Despite the dire food scarcity, majority of this food waste takes place in developing countries because of the lack of appropriate and affordable preservation techniques. Traditional open sun drying is the most popular food-reservation technique to the local farmers due to near-zero capital cost and cheap labor cost. However, this method is highly energy intensive, unhygienic, and time demanding. The high energy consumption resulting from uncontrolled simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer processes in traditional drying systems highlights the necessity of pursuing sustainability in drying process targeting reduced energy consumption, environmental and social impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources, with emphasis on the developing countries. It was observed that the integration of thermal energy storage with heat pump makes the integrated drying system more efficient, and dries food with better quality. Likewise, advanced integrated drying systems, such as, solar with microwave, and heat pump with microwave make the drying process more cost and quality competent. Finally, impact of resource distribution and governmental incentives for renewable energy use in sustainable drying is discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

To achieve certain SDGs, such as zero hunger (SDG2) and good health (SDG3) it is essential to give attention to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Fermented foods make up a large proportion of African diets, however, many have not received scientific attention or commitment.Aim:The aim of this review is to highlight some of these traditional fermented foods and their potential benefits in achieving good health target of the sustainable development goal. Discussion:Food insecurity is a global crisis; however, it has a heavier weight in some regions of the world, such as the SSA. Food fermentation may be essential for sustainable development because it helps in achieving food security through food preservation. These cultured foods make raw materials more digestible, nutritious, accepted by consumers because of new flavours. Africa is home to varieties of fermented foods, and many have not receive scientific attention. The scarcely reported fermented food of African origin includes cereal-based (degue, koko), legume-based (tayohounta, ntsambu, cachupu), vegetable-based (kawal, ntoba mbodi, kocho), milk-based (urubu, mursik, kivuguto), and fruit-based (akwandu, dockounou) foods. Cassava flour/dough, maize-based ogi and legume-based iru are relatively research and considered low hanging fruits to achieve sustainability. Despite the potentials of fermented foods in contributing to good health in Africa barriers such as how to increase quality substrate yield, safe and hygienic production, food safety, commercialization, and trade still hamper these products.Conclusion:A comprehensive understanding of the microbiota and microbiome of these fermented foods is crucial in enabling their full health benefits and addressing their risks and implications. © 2023 Omololu E.

But if they had better access to technology and training in a more equitable way, they could contribute much more. In effect, the rapid technological changes that have occurred in the sector pose an even greater challenge to achieve equalizing the role of women to that of men in the agri-food sector. The limitation of the female gender to training and empowerment prevents them from taking advantage of the technology that are contributing to the achievement of a world free of hunger and malnutrition, which is one of the sustainable development goals (SDG). Therefore, this work analyzes the world situation in terms of training and gender gaps to see if these elements affect the achievement of four of the sustainable development goals (SDG 2, 4, 5 10) in 87 countries. The results of the multiple linear regression show the existence of a positive relationship between these elements is demonstrated. Then, as a real example, Spain is chosen as a country reference and analyzed in terms of training by gender, digital gender gap and labor gap.

Several studies have presented evidence that changes in dietary patterns across the world can lead to win-win outcomes for environmental and social sustainability and can complement ongoing technological and policy efforts to improve the efficiency of agricultural production. However, the existing evidence have been compiled in “silos” by a large range of researchers across several disciplines using different indicators. The aim of this quantitative review is to bring together the existing knowledge on heterogeneity of current dietary patterns across the world and how a transition toward healthy diets in different countries can aid in progress toward multiple global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We first summarize the nutritional quality, economic cost, and environmental footprint of current diets of over 150 countries using multiple indicators. Next, we review which shifts in dietary patterns across different world regions can help toward achievement of SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and wellbeing), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG13 (Climate action), SDG14 (Life below water), and SDG15 (Life on land). Finally, we briefly discuss how to enable the shift toward sustainable dietary patterns and identify the research and data gaps that need to be filled through future efforts. Our analysis reveals that dietary change is necessary in all countries as each one has unique priorities and action items. For regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, increased intake of nutrient dense foods is needed to address deficiency of essential nutrients like folate, potassium, and vitamin A. For North America and Europe, shifting toward more plant-based diets would be healthier and simultaneously reduce the per capita environmental footprints. The results can be useful for policymakers in designing country-specific strategies for adoption of sustainable dietary behaviors and for food industry to ensure the supply of sustainable food items customized with regions' need.

Food waste has negative impacts on different dimensions of sustainability: social (hunger), economic (resource costs), and environmental (resource consumption and waste generation). This paper focuses on waste reduction through improving the inventory management system in the dairy distribution chain by the application of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). The approach is tested and verified in a case study by application of simulation modelling. Two inventory management models are created, and their impact on waste in the distribution part of the supply chain is examined. Model 1 represents the current dairy inventory management system in the supply of retail stores. Model 2 is based on a higher level of information connectivity between participants (RFID product labelling and the appropriate level of information technology), enabling automatic product ordering and changes in inventory management policy. The obtained results confirm that coordinated inventory management, supported by the application of modern ICT, can significantly contribute to the improvement of the sustainability of the food supply chain, and provide an exact quantification of the given contribution in the case of the dairy industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: The sample comprised 215 female undergraduates who responded to a two-questionnaire anonymous survey conducted in Tokyo, Japan in 2018 and 2019 from November to December. We measured mindful eating status using the Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and used Japanese plant-based dietary indices to determine plant-based dietary patterns. Partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine the correlation of mindful eating with energy and nutrient intake, food consumption, and plant-based dietary patterns, after adjusting for demographics and body mass index. Results: Participants with higher sub-scores in “health of the planet” and “awareness and appreciation for food” ate higher quantities of several micronutrients and plant-based foods and were more likely to have a healthful plant-based dietary pattern. They were also less likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern. In contrast, participants with higher scores in “non-judgmental awareness” ate less protein, whole grains, and vegetables, and were likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern.

Here, we explore a more environmentally sensitive alternative to improve global nutrition, consuming insects. Our study focuses on Africa and Asia, two continents with a history of eating insects and high rates of nutritional deficiency. We model the impact of adding modest amounts (2.5, 5 and 10 g per day, dry weight) of regionally appropriate and farmable species on total nutrient intake and population-wide risk of deficiency for specific nutrients of concern: protein, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12. We also estimate the total potential change in dietary iron. Five grams per day of insect consumption could alleviate a considerable amount of risk of nutritional deficiency: 67 million (95% uncertainty interval: 49-84 million) fewer people at risk of protein deficiency, 166 million (120-220 million) fewer people at risk of zinc deficiency, 237 million (120-439 million) fewer people at risk of folate deficiency, and 251 million (28-2271) fewer people at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. For iron, per capita supplies could increase by 3% (0.8%-6.0%) with insects, and even more so for vulnerable groups in countries currently suffering severe rates of anemia: 4.2% (0.5%-8.8%) for women of childbearing age and 4.1% (0.4%-10.0%) for children under 5. Doubling or halving insect intake per capita causes the benefits for nutritional deficiency risk to roughly double or halve accordingly. Effects are most pronounced in South and Central Asia, though sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and Southeast Asia also see considerable reduction in nutritional risk. These results demonstrate the potential for insects to fill a crucial role in providing nutrition for these populous and rapidly developing regions while safeguarding the global environment. © 2021 The Author(s).

Though hi-tech agri practices and modern food processing techniques are producing enough food for the entire population, still incidences of malnutrition, poverty, hunger question the food supply and security. There is enormous food wastage every year in the food supply chain, in different stages of post harvest manufacturing and spoilage during storage. Global population escalation on the other hand will contribute to hike in food prices. By mid century it is necessary to design the 'food for future' on a sustainable basis in a world that will be facing food sourcing and sustainability concerns, biodiversity problems, environmental and climatic hazards. Health disorders relating to under nutrition and over nutrition, consumer's attitudes need to be addressed for maintaining future food security and sustainability.

Most of the countries in the South Asian region are facing multiple challenges like high population growth, declining farm land area, and low productivity in primary and secondary sectors leading to limited employment opportunities. Consequently, both availability and access to food are adversely affected. Regions exposed to natural disasters, tribal and the hilly regions of SA are amongst the most vulnerable in terms of food security. Accelerated efforts are required to ensure that conflicts do not exacerbate the already fragile food situation in SA. Despite recent strong gains in economic growth and agricultural productivity, food and nutritional security remains a major concern in SA. The region has the largest concentration of poverty and hunger in the world, with nearly 40% of the world's impoverished and 45% of the world's undernourished people. The enormity of malnutrition in SA can be gauged from the fact that it is the home to nearly two-thirds of the world's undernourished children. More than 56% of the world's low-birth-weight babies are born in SA. Furthermore, food and nutrition security remain major challenges with a large proportion of the world's poor living here and global hunger index (GHI) at 30.9. Overcoming these twin challenges require actions both at the national and regional level. Among production constraints and yield gaps, imbalanced nutrient use is a critical issue in many of the SA countries, with nutrient application focused mainly on nitrogen (N), leaving the possibility for other plant nutrient deficiencies including phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In some cases, the use efficiency of N may be low due to losses in the form of N2O emissions, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), or via leaching with the undesirable offsite effects. Among the primary nutrients, K is an essential nutrient for productivity, food quality and numerous functions in the plant system. It plays a major role in activating ∼60 enzymes, regulating stomatal functions, controlling water relations especially under rainfed crop production, influencing the water balance of plant systems, and underpinning agronomic productivity and sustainability. Negative K balance in soil under intensive cropping is reported because of low external input and large crop removal, leading to large scale K mining in soils. Declining yield trends were observed in several fertilizer experiments 30–40 years long with continuous application of either N alone or NP without K under both irrigated and rainfed crop production systems in the region. Recent K fertility analysis indicates widespread K deficiency in light-textured alluvial soils, red and lateritic soils beside acid soil types in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. The countries in SA depend largely on imported K fertilizers. Such imported fertilizer should be utilized most efficiently in the light of limited global K mineral reserves and 93% of world total K exports are from five countries viz. Canada (37.12%) followed by the Russian Federation, Belarus, Germany and Israel. Therefore, the current review addresses issues related to the K supplying capacity of soils in various crop production systems in SA, crop K responses, soil test methods followed, emerging issues in soil K fertility, K balance in major cropping systems and rationalizing K recommendations among crops, soil types and agro-ecological regions. The role of K in balanced nutrition, farm productivity, food and nutritional security in these countries is examined. The review also covers the critical role of K in climate change adaptation, mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and improving overall nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the SA region. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

However, climate change threatens to reverse the progress made so far in the fight against food insecurity. The agricultural sector in many developing countries, including the rice and wheat producers such as in Punjab (Pakistan and India), is highly vulnerable to climate change, which has serious implications for rural livelihoods and food security. Adaptation is considered a key tool to tackle climate challenges at the farm level and is, therefore, the focus of this study in terms of its impact on rice yields. A household survey was conducted in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and farmers were interviewed face-to-face. We employed a simultaneous equations model to assess the differential impacts of climate change adaptation on adapting and non-adapting farmers’ rice yields. Using the cross-sectional data of 480 rice growers, an endogenous switching regression model provided a means to estimate the selection bias of farmers’ attributes. The results show a significant positive impact of adaptations on rice yields. Specifically, the yield of farmers who adapted to climate change was 24% higher than the non-adapting farmers. The results further indicate that non-adapters can also benefit from the adaptation strategies if they decide to adapt. We also found a significant positive effect of farmers’ climate risk perceptions, literacy level, access to irrigation, ownership of livestock, and availability of farm advisory services on their adaptation decisions. These results, therefore, suggest that policymakers should take into account farmers’ local adaptation knowledge and farming practices when formulating adaptation policies. © 2022 by the authors."

In 2010, an estimated 239 million people or 26% of the world’s malnourished people lived in Sub-Saharan Africa. The trend is particularly problematic in the Horn of Africa, where in 2011; thirteen million people lived in hunger. The widespread concern about food insecurity inspired international collaboration between CIMMYT and IITA to leverage innovation as a tool to develop hybrid maize, known as the Drought Tolerant Maize in Africa (DTMA). Maize is a staple food providing livelihoods to more than 300 million Africans. The initiative, which is carried out in thirteen countries in East, West and Southern Africa, aims at generating, by 2016, drought tolerant maize providing a one ton/hectare yield increase under adverse weather conditions, while increasing the average yield by 20–30%, with an outreach of 30–40 million people. It also promises to add an annual average of US$160–200 million additional grain. Therefore, the major objective of this chapter is to elaborate food insecurity crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa and the role of DTMA in stemming the tide. The chapter employs empirical data to assess drought tolerant maize in Africa and its potential effects on household food security and poverty reduction. It reveals a significant increase in output associated with DTMA and demonstrates a strong potential to combat regional food insecurity. The chapter therefore proffers recommendations aimed at transforming African agriculture through novel technologies and innovative practices, as well as the development of market mechanisms that spur higher productivity, environmental sustainability and poverty reduction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

While food trade and the embedded (virtual) water (VW) may improve food availability and accessibility for more people all year round, the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trade needs to be revisited. In this research, we assess the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trades under two food security scenarios for Iran, a country suffering from an escalating water crisis. These scenarios are (1) Individual Crop Food Security (ICFS), which restricts calorie fulfillment from individual crops and (2) Crop Category Food Security (CCFS), which promotes “eating local” by suggesting food substitution within the crop category. To this end, we simulate the water footprint and VW trades of 27 major crops, within 8 crop categories, in 30 provinces of Iran (2005–2015). We investigate the impacts of these two scenarios on (a) provincial food security (FSp) and exports; (b) sustainable and efficient blue water consumption, and (c) blue VW export. We then test the correlation between agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators and provincial food security. Our results show that most provinces were threatened by unsustainable and inefficient blue water consumption for crop production, particularly in the summertime. This water mismanagement results in 14.41 and 8.45 billion m3 y−1 unsustainable and inefficient blue VW exports under ICFS. “Eating local” improves the FSp value by up to 210% which lessens the unsustainable and inefficient blue VW export from hotspots. As illustrated in the graphical abstract, the FSp value strongly correlates with different agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators, but in different ways. Our findings promote “eating local” besides improving agro-economic and socio-environmental conditions to take transformative steps toward eradicating food insecurity not only in Iran but also in other countries facing water limitations. © 2021, The Author(s)."

We combined a multi-regional input–output database (EXIOBASE) with food demand projections (OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018).

Then, we built a second, zero-hunger scenario to investigate the impacts due to the eradication of hunger by 2030, a target of Sustainable Development Goal 2. The results show that total growth in environmental impacts through food consumption is the highest for Indonesia (44–54%), India (35–43%) and Mexico (31–48%). The total impacts stay highest in Brazil (land stress), China (eutrophication) and India (climate change and water scarcity), mainly driven by meat, fish and dairy consumption, respectively. The zero-hunger scenario results in similar health improvements across all countries: 0.08 to 0.12 prevented disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per undernourished person. It would achieve the highest health improvements in India and China with around 375,000 human life equivalents of prevented DALYs combined. There are only slight trade-offs between hunger eradication and environmental goals. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."

Among these objectives are some in the field of agriculture and rural development such as: SDG 2: eradicating world hunger, EU agriculture ensures that food is produced sustainably for all EU citizens, and that EU food exports contribute to food security in third countries. EU rural development and agriculture policies also support other SDGs: SGD 1 (without poverty), DGS 8 (decent work and growth), SGD12 (responsible consumption and production) and SGD 15 (terrestrial life).

Food system activities have contributed to great gains for humanity but have also led to significant challenges, including hunger, poor diet quality, inequity, and threats to nature. While it is recognized that food systems are central to multiple global commitments and goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, current trajectories are not aligned to meet these objectives. As mounting crises further stress food systems, the consequences of inaction are clear. The goal of food system transformation is to generate a future where all people have access to healthy diets, which are produced in sustainable and resilient ways that restore nature and deliver just, equitable livelihoods. A rigorous, science-based monitoring framework can support evidence-based policymaking and the work of those who hold key actors accountable in this transformation process. Monitoring can illustrate current performance, facilitate comparisons across geographies and over time, and track progress. We propose a framework centered around five thematic areas related to (1) diets, nutrition, and health; (2) environment and climate; and (3) livelihoods, poverty, and equity; (4) governance; and (5) resilience and sustainability. We hope to call attention to the need to monitor food systems globally to inform decisions and support accountability for better governance of food systems as part of the transformation process.

Since the world level of urbanization has already crossed 50% and is expected to cross 68% by 2030, the world is more urban than rural, and hence our focus is more on urban solutions. Food production itself causes 25% of global emissions. Presence of hunger might suggest that food production is insufficient, which is a myth, as an estimate by Food and Agriculture organization suggests that the world produces more food than is needed.

However, there has been losing links between crops and livestock in the recent past due to promotion of mono- or double-crop-based intensive agricultural production systems owing to compulsions of hunger and poverty. Such farming practices resulted in issues of sustainability and economic viability due to stagnant productivity, deteriorating soil health, risk of failure of mono-cropping, absence of by-product and resource recycling, etc. Therefore, a study was planned during 2014–2018 involving multiple enterprises like food crops, agroforestry (fruits + vegetables), forage, livestock and water harvesting-cum-fish production to enhance productivity, profitability, energy efficiency, resource recycling and soil health. The IFS model of one hectare size besides producing multiple products (grains, fruit, vegetable, fodder, milk, fish, etc.) also resulted in US$ 1671/year net return with a benefit cost ratio of 1.58 and generated 293 man-days/year employment as against US$ 1287 net return and 119 man-days in groundnut–wheat cropping system. Energy efficiency, net energy gain and energy profitability were observed higher in groundnut–wheat cropping system. However, the share of indirect energy (71%) and renewable energy (67%) was more in IFS making it more self-reliant and sustainable. The IFS approach ensured round the year supply of income and a farmer can get approximately 265 to 597 US$ every month while he gets income only twice a year by adopting double cropping. Further, nearly 10.22 tonnes of farm yard manure and 2.5 tonnes of farm compost were recycled under IFS that improved soil health as compared to the double cropping. The study concluded that the IFS approach is capable of producing multiple products, improving productivity, profitability, employment opportunities, soil health and sustaining livelihood in vulnerable ecologies like SAT of central India and other parts of the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

We are witnessing increasing social inequalities and the accentuation of hunger around the world, especially in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. At the same time, malnutrition and effects of climate change are endangering both the health of people and nature, putting life and the planet itself at risk. In general, specialists agree that the solutions to the current crisis involve the transformation of hegemonic food production chains (globalized and industrialized) and the strengthening of more territorialized food systems. The present paper reflects on how the territorial approach (extensively promoted by the State in Latin America countries in the 21st century) can be collaboratively used to create territorial food markets that are more autonomous, sustainable, and connected with nature and territorial resources. Our hypothesis is that territorial development reinforces more sustainable food systems that increase the resilience of territories facing the current challenges of rural development. The methodology involves a thematic and selective literature review, the analysis of secondary indicators, and conducting online interviews. Our analysis focused on Latin America, one of the most advanced areas in territorial development policies. We situated our research in the Borborema Territory (Paraíba, Brazil), which is a significant case study for understanding the dynamics of territorialization (and deterritorialization) of agroecological production systems that are geared towards family farming. It is also, in our opinion, a concrete case that suggests how territorialized and more localized food systems show greater resilience in the face of adversity, which can be observed in the territorial actors’ ability to react to deterritorialization drivers that are emphasised in periods of crisis. Our main findings suggest that territorial development, by placing territory, resources, and territorial actors and institutions at the core of rural development strategies, reinforces territorialized food systems centred in small circuits of production–consumption. These alternative food systems not only contribute to social and environmental sustainability but enhance territorial development by expanding opportunities for territorial actors by diversifying the territorial economy and creating more crisis-resilient territories. © 2022 by the authors.

Agroforestry is a well acknowledged and established management practice to minimize the trade-offs, and to sustainably manage the contested landscapes while satisfying the growing demands of both local and global ecosystem beneficiaries. However, various facets of agroforestry, its management modality, institutional arrangements, and implementation outcomes are inadequately understood. This paper aims to scrutinize major agroforestry practices through the methods of systematic review of literature, government policies, and project reports. Taking a case of Nepal, this paper presents agroforestry transition from forest-based agroforestry (i.e., shifting cultivation) to farm-based integrated approach to agroforestry in Nepal. This paper reveals that integrated agro-forestry approach is crucial in creating win-win scenarios among various stakeholders by minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies among ES, especially food, fibre, and other ES (i.e., biodiversity, soil functioning, water, and climate regulation). Analysing socio-economic, ecological, and institutional factors that are affecting agroforestry for the last fifty years, we further suggest an integrated model of agroforestry which is replicable in other countries with similar socio-economic status, practicing subsistence farming system. The findings of the paper are crucial in awakening scholars, policy makers and landscape managers for up-scaling and out-scaling of integrated approach to agroforestry for ecosystem management and attainment of various sustainable development goals such as, no poverty (#1), zero hunger (#2), climate action (#13), and life on land (#15). © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

We assess best practices, processing technologies, environmental maintenance, multi-benefits of enset and its potency in hunger reduction in Ethiopia by reviewing evidence on good farm practices, improved technologies, sustainability, hunger reduction, inputs cost, and yields advantage of enset. The review results identify those best practices that optimize enset yield, technologies that facilitate extension services, processing and food qualities of enset. Moreover, we find that enset is a first-rated climate-smart crop, superior hunger solution because of its apparent capability to endure long periods (more than 5 years) of drought, highest yield, energy food supply, and costs advantages. In contrast, its long-period maturity, cultural perceptions, and little development policy attention given to enset limit its expansion. Therefore, exploring and creating universal access mechanism of early maturing and high-yielding varieties, processing technologies and mobile-based advices, involving best practices of enset in regular agricultural extension services, changing social perceptions optimize enset yield and production thereby it contributes environmental sustainability and cuts hunger challenges. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Transforming food systems to mitigate climate change and hidden hunger, ensure food security and good health all point to reducing animal-based foods as a key lever. Moving beyond animal-based food systems is a societal grand challenge requiring coordinated international research by the social sciences and humanities. A ‘selective openness’ to this range of disciplines has been observed within multi-discipline research programmes designed to address societal grand challenges including those concerned with the sustainability of food systems, inhibiting the impact of social sciences and humanities. Further, existing research on animal-based foods within these disciplines is largely dispersed and focused on particular parts of food systems. Inspired by the ‘Sutherland Method’ this paper discusses the results of an iterative research prioritisation process carried out to enhance capacity, mutual understanding and impact amongst European social sciences and humanities researchers. The process produced 15 research questions from an initial list of 100 and classified under the following five themes: (1) debating and visioning food from animals; (2) transforming agricultural spaces; (3) framing animals as food; (4) eating practices and identities; and (5) governing transitions beyond animal-based food systems. These themes provide an important means of making connections between research questions that invite and steer research on key challenges in moving beyond animal-based food systems. The themes also propose loci for future transdisciplinary research programmes that join researchers from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities and stakeholders from beyond academia to develop cooperative research and implementation initiatives. The experiences gained from the prioritisation process draw attention to the value of spending time to discuss and collaboratively steer research enquiry into emergent and controversial matters of concern. Fundamental, ethical questions around the continuation or complete cessation of the use of animals for food was a key tension. The positioning of research towards these questions affects not only the framing of the research area but also the partners with whom the research can be carried out and for whom it may be of benefit. © 2021, The Author(s)."

However, the development of a sustainable aquaculture industry has been hindered by the limited availability of natural resources as well as its negative impact on the surrounding environment. Hence, there is an urgent need to search for better aquacultural production systems that, despite their high productivity and profitability, utilize fewer resources such as water, energy, land, and capital in conjunction with a negligible impact on the environment. Biofloc technology (BFT) is one of the most exciting and promising sustainable aquaculture systems; it takes into account the intensive culture of aquatic species, zero water exchange, and improved water quality as a result of beneficial microbial biomass activity, which, at the same time, can be utilized as a nutritious aquaculture feed, thus lowering the costs of production. Furthermore, BFT permits the installation of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems in which the wastes of one organism are utilized as feed by another organism, without a detrimental effect on co-cultured species. This review, therefore, highlights the basics of BFT, factors associated with BFT for the successful production of aquatic species, the significance of this food production system for the sustainable production of economically important aquatic species, its economic aspects, drawbacks, limitations, and recommended management aspects for sustainable aquaculture. © 2021 by the authors.

The fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) has been devasting to smallholder farmer food security since it spread to sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, who have suffered massive crop losses, particularly maize, an important staple for basic sustenance. Since the FAW mainly devours green leaf biomass during the maize vegetative growth stage, the implementation of remote sensing technologies offers opportunities for monitoring the FAW. Here, we developed and tested a Sentinel 2 a+b satellite-based monitoring algorithm based on optimized first-derivative NDVI time series analysis using Google Earth Engine. For validation, we first employed the FAO Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System (FAMEWS) mobile app data from Kenya, and then subsequently conducted field validation campaigns in Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Tanzania. Additionally, we directly observed loss of green biomass during maize vegetative growth stages caused by the FAW, confirming the observed signals of loss of the leaf area index (LAI) and the total green biomass (via the NDVI). Preliminary analyses suggested that satellite monitoring of small-scale farmer fields at the regional level may be possible with an NDVI first-derivative time series anomaly analysis using ESA Sentinel 2 a+b (R2 = 0.81). Commercial nanosatellite constellations, such as PlanetScope, were also explored, which may offer benefits from greater spatial resolution and return interval frequency. Due to other confounding factors, such as clouds, intercropping, weeds, abiotic stresses, or even other biotic pests (e.g., locusts), validation results were mixed. Still, maize biomass anomaly detection for monitoring the FAW using satellite data could help confirm the presence of the FAW with the help of expanded field-based monitoring through the FAO FAMEWS app. © 2022 by the authors."

Gas flaring, oil spillage, and other forms of land and water pollution seriously degrade the natural environment as well as displace Nigerians from their homes and traditional occupations. Pollution has caused increased flooding, erosion, and dearth of both food and fishes, leading to poverty and hidden hunger, among other problems. More destructive is the reactionary disposition of the Nigerian state to climate change and ecological disasters. Beside the provision of make-shift structures and relief materials to flood victims, there are hardly any proactive efforts on the ground to check the activities of multinational corporations operating in the country. Greg Mbajiorgu's eco-drama Wake Up Everyone (2011) depicts the challenges of the climate crisis in contemporary Nigeria. A close reading and critical analysis of the play, which is a microcosm of the country, illuminates the ways these challenges affect Nigerians and the need for action. Apart from displacing individuals from their homes, flooding takes a heavy toll on the agricultural sector, as most crops and livestock production systems in Nigeria are not yet fully technology-based and are, therefore, susceptible to environmental degradation. As a result, the flooding of farms and plantations, damaging crops and seedlings, leads to a corresponding degree of food scarcity/insecurity and indeed inflation in the cost of farm produce. This paper concludes that conscious efforts suggested in the play should be made to forestall multinational corporations from further pillaging the environment, and that government functionaries saddled with the task of forging active measures to stem the effects of climate change in the country should rise to their responsibilities. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

The convenience of FDAs may cause consumers to order more food than people's level of hunger warrants, leading to food waste. Food waste is a grave societal problem, which, the authors argue, represents the dark side of FDAs. However, the tendency of consumers to order more food than required, or to engage in food over-ordering behaviour, has remained under-explored in the context of FDAs. Design/methodology/approach: This study addresses the gap by examining the antecedents of over-ordering behaviour on FDAs through the theoretical lens of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which past studies on food waste have also used. Findings: The authors' results confirm the positive association of attitude, subjective norms and leftover reuse intentions with over-ordering behaviour. The moderation effect of age and gender on the relationship between subjective norms with over-ordering is also confirmed.

This article tackles three blind spots in the understanding of rural poverty and vulnerability: the narrow focus on extreme poverty and hunger that hides a much wider set of inequalities and vulnerabilities, insufficient recognition of the diversity of rural households, and an inadequate appreciation of the impact of rapid structural changes in markets, the physical environment, and the political economic context. A better understanding of these areas is necessary for imagining a new policy landscape that can align progress on rural poverty alleviation with a wider transformation of food systems. The article provides a framework for assessing the dynamics of rural wellbeing and food systems change. It looks at the viability of small-scale farming and the diversification of livelihood options needed to overcome rural poverty and inequality. The analysis suggests that the future prosperity of rural areas will depend on policy reforms to address market failures in the food system, which currently work against equity, good nutrition and sustainability. Investments will also be needed to enable rural economies to capture greater value from the food system, particularly in the midstream of food distribution, processing and services.

This study critically analyses the trends and related issues perpetuating the development gap between privileged and marginalised communities in SA. It explores the link between innovative food production and food consumption entrepreneurship and underdevelopment based on sustainable development goals (SDGs). The study also generates a conceptual model designed to bridge the development gap between privileged and marginalised communities in SA. Philosophically, an interpretivism research paradigm based on the socialised interpretation of extant literature is pursued. Consistent with this stance, an inductive approach and qualitative methodological choices are applied using a combination of thematic analysis and grounded theory to generate research data. Grounded theory techniques determine the extent to which the literature review readings are simultaneously pursued, analysed, and conceptualised to generate the conceptual model. Research findings highlight the perpetual inequality in land distribution, economic and employability status, social mobility, gender equity, education, emancipation, empowerment, and quality of life between privileged and marginalised societies in SA. Underdevelopment issues such as poverty, unemployment, hunger, criminal activities, therefore, characterise marginalised communities and are linked to SDGs. Arguably, food production and food consumption entrepreneurship are ideally positioned to address underdevelopment by creating job opportunities, generating income, transforming the economic status, social mobility, and quality of life. Although such entrepreneurship development initiatives in SA are acknowledged, their impact remains insignificant because the interventions are traditionally prescriptive, fragmented, linear, and foreign-driven. A robust, contextualised, integrated, and transformative approach is developed based on the conceptual model designed to create a sustainable, innovative, and digital entrepreneurship development plan that will be executed to yield employment, generate income and address poverty, hunger, gender inequity.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has one of the fastgrowing populations with more than half of the global growth between now and 2050. The challenge now lies in feeding the ever-growing population that is exerting pressure on the limited available resources. Doubling the agricultural productivity of small-scale farmers by 2030 (SDG 2.3) remains a daunting task for researcher and policy makers to address on the continent that now relies much on imports of food. Exploitation of the untapped massive land resources for agricultural production poses threats to sustainability. However, the challenges of global warming cannot be left out of this discussion since it has direct impact on future productivity on the continent. Climate change that has been projected to mostly affect the poorer countries also present trials to the food system through increased diseases and weather extremes of floods and droughts. Questions are yet to be answered on which tradeoffs and synergies if any need to be made to achieve zero hunger in Africa by 2030. This synopsis critically breaks down the conflicts, tradeoffs and synergies of how a continent with such massive agricultural production potential can navigate sustainably to achieve zero hunger, self-sufficiency and exports prospects while conserving the environment and natural resources.

It is difficult to manage these conditions or standardize improvement systems without thinking of the three main elements or subsystems that are necessary for any meaningful development—namely water (W), energy (E), and food (F). These key elements form what is globally agreed upon as the “WEF Nexus.” While considering them, one should think about the other key factors that influence WEF Nexus, including population’s growth, impacts of environmental changes (including climate change), moderation and adaptation regimes to climate change and climate resilience, loss of biodiversity, and sustainable nature. Together, the WEF Nexus subsystems represent a framework to ensure environmental protection that should be seen as an ethical and socioeconomic obligation. Issues, such as protection of water resources, and strategies and management tools or mechanisms for the use of water assets and agricultural innovations under the obligations of sustainable use, are investigated in this paper. Attention is paid to the relationship between water and food (WF Nexus) or water for food security in various world regions, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Central Asia countries and the Caucasus, China, Africa, and Canada. This paper also presents analyses of a great number of up-to-date publications regarding the “Nexus” perspective and its applications and limitations. This paper suggests that the Nexus’ approach, in its different concepts (WEF, WE, WF and EF), can promote sustainable development and improve the quality of life of communities, while preserving natural, human, and social capital, addressing sustainability challenges, and protecting natural resources and the environment for long-term use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The theme of food and nutrition security speaks most directly to the United Nations’ sustainable development goal Zero Hunger. Climate change effects are felt beyond production, as extreme weather events come to disrupt other aspects of the food system, such as transport, storage, and distribution networks. Despite food systems’ contributions to worsening climate change issues, they hold great promise to make significant remediating contributions. From the perspective of sustainability, it is crucial that the flows of nutrients that the food system mobilizes at whatever scale are recycled in a closed system circular economy and within a carbon-neutral energy budget.

Some strategies to promote sustainability include reducing inputs, substituting conventional crops with genetically modified (GM) alternatives, and using organic production. Here, we leveraged global databases covering 121 countries to determine which farming strategies—the amount of inputs per area (fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation), GM crops, and percent agriculture in organic production—are most correlated with 12 sustainability metrics recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Using quantile regression, we found that countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, countries with more GM crops were last on track to meeting the SDG of reduced inequalities. Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004–2018, we found that countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa. Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a lesser extent, intensive use of inputs.

Hunger, waste, poor distribution of food, and low diversity affect many countries, and small family farmers are abandoning their activities due to the challenges which minimize the possibilities of contemplating SDG 12. Local production and SDG 12 favor access to safe and cheaper food, thereby encouraging food security and minimizing food waste. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with the participation of local actors in 16 municipalities in southern Brazil.

Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008–2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption.

The purpose of this article is to identify the prospects for simultaneously combating hunger and achieving sustainable agriculture in a model of its expanded reproduction. As a result, it is substantiated that to engage in Intensified Productivity, the private sector, which includes farmers, processors, and merchants, requires a sound governmental foundation and management. These are necessary for local agriculture and marketing to compete with imports and for purchasers to approach reasonably priced privately supplied food (Pretty and Bharucha in Ann Bot 114:1571–1596, 2014). Governments must ensure that input procurement, product promotion, and access to routine assets, data, preparation, instruction, and social services are all affordable. This will necessitate sufficient funds for assistance as well as net ventures. Supportable Intensification may also make a significant contribution to mitigating environmental change by increasing carbon retention in well-managed soils and reducing outflows due to increased compost and water system utilisation.

Yet this potential is being overshadowed by competing uses of ocean resources in an accelerating “blue economy.” The current emphasis on production growth, rather than equitable distribution of benefits, has created three unexamined or flawed assumptions that growth in the blue economy will lead to growth in “blue food” production, increased production will inevitably lead to improved food and nutrition security, and mariculture production will replace marine capture fisheries. In this perspective, we argue that if research and policies are pursued without addressing these “blind spots,” blue food contributions to reducing hunger and malnutrition, and to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, will be limited.

We focus on increasing protein content, the use of alternative protein crops and improving protein functionality. Furthermore, approaches to enhance the content of vitamins and minerals as well as healthy specialised metabolites and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered. In addition, methods to reduce antinutrients and toxins are presented. These approaches could help to decrease the ‘hidden hunger’ caused by micronutrient deficiencies.

Agriculture, forestry, and land use (AFLOU) sectors account for 13% of CO2 emanations in the atmosphere, contributing considerably to global warming and climate change. Climate change’s negative effects may be seen in the falling ecosystem production, both biological and man-made all around the world. Poor farming communities are the most susceptible to climate change, with an estimated 820 million people already suffering from chronic hunger and malnutrition, and a reduction in food production due to climate change might exacerbate food insecurity. Small farmers and destitute people demand long-term, adaptive livelihood arrangements, which always entail reliance on a variety of products. The carbon stored by agroforestry may balance the present US emission rate of 1,600 Tg C/year from fossil fuel combustion (Combustion, petroleum, and natural gas) by 34%. If large nature reserves or plantations are maintained for long-term carbon sequestration and storage, local residents may revert back to other commodities like fibre and sustenance. From different agroforestry systems, taungya agroforestry system accounted for 174 MgC/ha carbon accumulation in agroforestry networks. As a result, carbon offset regulations must account for important local environmental and socioeconomic concerns, as well as local participation and veto power. Total above—and belowground tree C stock accounted for 69 and 64% of total system C in the silvopasture and plantation, respectively. Developing appropriate policies to stimulate the use of carbon-sequestering agroforestry methods faces numerous obstacles, including demonstrating additionality, managing the risk of sequestered carbon losses, and involving smallholders and pastoralists with uncertain land tenure.

Pasture-based dairy systems in regions like New Zealand and Ireland are oriented towards maximum milk yield per unit of pasture, which has led to Holstein strains that are 50 to 100 kg lighter, exhibit a higher body condition score, and produce roughly half the annual amount of milk as compared to their Holstein counterparts kept in confinement in North America and Europe. Freedom from hunger might not be guaranteed when high-yielding dairy cows are kept on pasture without any supplemental feed, but at the same time no access to pasture can be considered an animal welfare concern, because pasturing is generally beneficial to the animals' health. On pasture, lighter-weight dairy cows with a medium milk production potential have proven to be superior with regard to feed efficiency and fertility.

This symbolic connection between meat and status persists today. Thus, based upon psychological theories of compensation, individuals low on subjective socioeconomic status (SES) should have a greater preference for meat, as meat may be substitutable for the status that they lack. Three experiments tested this premise. Participants who felt low on subjective SES preferred meat-based foods compared to participants who felt high on it (Experiment 1). The effect is driven by a desire for status (Experiments 2–3) and not by felt hunger or power (Experiments 1–2) and not generalizable to plant foods (Experiment 3). The results suggest a symbolic link between meat and status, which has intriguingly not yet been empirically shown, and we also demonstrate a consequence of the link for food preference.

On the other hand, the authors argue that the cause of Ethiopia's recurrent famine is not only natural interference, but it is also the reaction of society and governments that create a famine. Food security for Ethiopia requires an integrated long-term response to household vulnerability on the part of Ethiopian governments, civil society, and international partners by incorporating new technologies, local expertise, and active involvement of Ethiopian communities living with the realities of recurrent famine.

Consequently, fisheries are of paramount importance for several Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDGs 1 and 8, which are related to poverty and economic growth, as well as SDGs 2 and 3, which are about zero hunger and good health. On the other hand, fisheries can also negatively influence the ecosystem (SDG 14, life below water). Thailand is one of the world's most significant producers and exporters of fisheries products. This present work describes the evolution of wild fisheries production in Thailand for over twenty years and discusses its impact on fish and shellfish supplies. The present overview uses mainly the official statistical catch data of Thailand. From 1995 to 2015, Thailand's marine fisheries production gradually decreased from approximately 2.8 million tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes per year. Concerning taxonomic composition of the catches, no dramatic shifts were recorded during the 20-year period. The main observation seems that for less abundant taxa, such as Chirocentridae, Sillaginidae, Ariidae, Sharks, and Psettodidae, their part in the catch was halved between 1995 and 2015. On the other hand, inland capture fisheries remained constant at 0.2 million tonnes per year. The annual value of wild fisheries production was, on average US$1.7 billion. Notably, trawl fishing systematically reduced during these two decennia, resulting in a fishing efficiency of approximately 140 tonnes of demersal fish per trawl unit per year in 2015. During 2008-2015, the number of registered gill net fishing boats drastically increased from 2,300 to 6,600, and this has led to a dramatic decline in fishing efficiency to about 10% in 2014-2015. More in general, Thailand's continuous decline in marine capture production was linked to increased fuel prices, tightening restrictions by neighbouring countries for access into their exclusive economic zone, and the depletion of resources due to overfishing and illegal fishing. Against rising concerns about the sustainability of intensive fishing practices in recent years, Thailand is ramping up efforts to reduce the exploitation of fishery resources to levels that would achieve maximum sustainable yields. In particular, the intensity of fishing based on gill nets needs to be addressed in the future. Hence, Thailand's fisheries production faces the pressure of realising the importance of sustainable fisheries resources management and its impact on marine life and biodiversity, in addition to its role as a significant food source for a healthy population. © 2019 by the authors."

Currently, ammonia for fertilizers is one of the highest volume commodity chemicals and is produced through the Haber-Bosch process. However, this process is energy and carbon intensive and is highly centralized, which leads to inequitable distribution of fertilizers across the globe. Developed countries have an abundance of fertilizer and often over-apply it, leading to nitrogen pollution in water and air. Contrarily, developing countries lack access to fertilizer, resulting in malnutrition and hunger. Solar fertilizers provide a route to combine solar energy with nitrogen, oxygen, and water that are available in the air to produce nitrogen-based nutrients for plants. This work examines the agronomic and technical considerations of solar fertilizers and suggests that they present an opportunity to promote more equitable, efficient, and sustainable production and utilization of fertilizers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.; Nitrogen fertilizers are critical to supporting the current global human population. However, current means of production require massive energy inputs, have a large carbon footprint, and are highly centralized. One sustainable alternative is the decentralized production of “solar fertilizers” that utilize solar energy and air as inputs. This work examines the feasibility of solar fertilizer technologies including agricultural implications of decentralized fertilizer production, the technological requirements to achieve solar fertilizers, and initial targets for key performance metrics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.; Using solar energy to convert triple bonded molecular dinitrogen from the air into fixed nitrogen products that act as nutrients for plants presents an opportunity to develop “solar fertilizers.” The approach has much in common with solar fuels and chemicals but also has some unique advantages and challenges. The possibility of producing nitrogen fertilizers at a country's regional level may be able to effectively compete with existing technology by reducing the per unit cost of N nutrient production, removing or reducing transportation costs within or across international borders, and integrating with existing infrastructure. Furthermore, solar fertilizer technologies can reduce the energy and carbon footprint currently associated with the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. Deploying solar fertilizer technology in developing countries can also improve access to fertilizers for farmers in remote regions and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all people, in particular the poor. However, there are also substantial challenges that must be overcome in identifying active catalytic materials and effectively integrating solar fertilizer processes with agricultural infrastructure. This paper outlines the agronomic considerations that drive the development of decentralized solar fertilizer production and explores their implications on fertilizer prices with an emphasis on the developing world.

Given the high dependence of the modern global food production system on the continuous supply of commercial phosphorus (P) fertilizers, the goal of achieving global food security could be hampered by any form of paucity of the global P resource. P is a finite, non-substitutable, non-renewable, and geographically restricted resource. The anthropogenic influences on this critical resource are likely to pose a number of challenges to its sustainability. Based on an in-depth and systematic review of recently published literature, this study presents a detailed, methodical, and up to date assessment of the key sustainability challenges for the global P resource, and highlights their implications for global food security. The assessment indicates that the demand for P fertilizer to produce enough food for the growing global population will substantially increase by the middle of this century. There are also significant discrepancies in estimates of the lifetime of global phosphate rock (the main source of chemical P fertilizer) reserves that range from a few hundred to a thousand years; however, as global reserves deplete, exploitation of, and exploration for, resources will replenish reserves although the global P resource is finite. The signs of geopolitical constraints regarding phosphate rock reserves are already evident, and are likely to be more intense in future. The combined impact of increasing demand, dwindling reserves, and geopolitical constraints could result in a substantial decline in the production and supply of chemical P fertilizer in the global market and lead to an increased P price, and this situation may eventually restrict the access of farmers of many countries to P fertilizers for food production. Moreover, there is evidence of significant P wastage and loss as well as high discharge to water bodies from various systems at different geographical scales. The wastage and loss of P in this manner, if not checked, will not only increase the global demand for P but also result in the increased depletion of global phosphate rock reserves. On the other hand, the continuing high discharge of P to water bodies will accelerate harmful processes such as algal bloom, hypoxia and eutrophication that deplete fish and other aquatic foods, the signs of which are already apparent, and may cause irreparable damage to aquatic ecosystems. Shortage in supply of fish and sea foods in turn will restrict the access of many people to a protein based diet, and eventually result in hunger and malnutrition; however, this important fact is often overlooked while addressing the significance of sustainable P management for global food security. We recommend that any policy at the international, national, and local levels that aims to achieve food security and to protect aquatic ecosystems should incorporate measures to address the key sustainability challenges for the global P resource. An overview of the recent advances in the knowledge of sustainable P management strategies as presented in this study could be effectively utilized to mitigate these challenges for achieving global phosphorus security, food security, and environmental sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

However, indicators used for assessing progress toward the goals do not account for these interactions. To understand the potential implications of this compartmentalized assessment framework, we explore progress evaluations toward SDG 14 (Life below Water) and intersecting social goals presented in submissions to the UN High-Level Political Forum. We show that there is a disconnect between the apparent progress shown by indicators and long-term sustainability; for example, short-term gains in reducing hunger or poverty might be undermined by poor ocean health, particularly in countries dependent on fisheries or developing their blue economy. We suggest an extension to existing indicator assessments to integrate scenarios and social-ecological modeling.

While SDG2 identified that ending hunger and malnutrition requires the progressive realization of the right to food, through participation and empowerment of local communities, recent literature has also criticized the overemphasis on State-led regulatory interventions for having led to a uniformity of solutions that the use of classical tools by the State presupposes. It is now increasingly recognized that there is a need to a shift away from State-led solutions for citizens, to a focus on the ability for citizen groups to collectively design and implement their own solutions at the local level. Based on examples from both the European Union and the United States, this chapter provides two main contributions. First, it provides a review of the latest legal developments in the human right to food at the international level and combines this with a description of the problematic of the definition and identification local rights-based food policies. Second, the chapter develops the concept of local rights-based food policy in the context of the E.U. and the U.S. through two case studies based on semi-directed interviews with citizen groups working in these regions, and presents the opportunities and challenges of the concept and its implications on both sides of the Atlantic. The chapter concludes by presenting ways forward for the inclusion of human rights within municipal food policy, a necessary feature of the holistic approach required for sustainable development. © Springer Nature Switzerl and AG 2020, corrected publication 2020."

Characterized by easy access to nutrient-poor processed food and blocked access to foods that secure dietary health and sustain well-being, “the new hunger” has been linked in public health and social science literature to obesogenic environments, defined as both food and built environments that promote obesity. The paper examines how non-governmental organizations work within distinct policy ecologies to improve food access and food security and promote community health, focusing on one high-impact Mobile Farmers’ Market Program that was successful in building community infrastructure to promote dietary health and improve food security at the community level through improved food access.

The need for radical transformation of current food systems is inescapable if the world is to achieve one, let alone all, of these goals. Meeting this challenge will inevitably be disruptive to current food systems, carry costs, and be politically onerous. But the projected benefits far outweigh these difficulties. This commentary spells out the complexity of issues that need to be tackled to design and implement food systems that improve diets, nutrition, and health in an equitable fashion, while simultaneously respecting planetary boundaries. Six critical domains are identified that must be addressed for the successful transformation of food systems: 1) reinvent agriculture, 2) transform food environments for healthy diets, 3) mitigate climate change, 4) productively engage the private sector, 5) influence public policy priorities, and 6) establish true cost accounting of food. Because science is crucial for each of these domains, a research-driven strategy, emphasizing a collaborative process, is outlined. Bold, new, but technically and politically feasible actions are needed to effectively transform current food systems. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

Throughout these transitions, there has been a progressive population explosion and net ecosystem loss and degradation. Climate change now gathers pace, exacerbated by ecological dysfunction. Our health status has been challenged by a developing people-environment mismatch. We have regarded ecological conquest and innovative technology as solutions, but have not understood how ecologically dependent and integrated we are. We are ecological creatures interfaced by our sensoriness, microbiomes, shared regulatory (endocrine) mechanisms, immune system, biorhythms and nutritional pathways. Many of us are 'nature-deprived'. We now suffer what might be termed ecological health disorders (EHD). If there were less of us, nature's resilience might cope, but more than 9 billion people by 2050 is probably an intolerable demand on the planet. Future food must increasingly take into account the pressures on ecosystem-dependent food systems, with foods probably less biodiverse, although eating in this way allows optimal health; energy dysequilibrium with less physical activity and foods inappropriately energy dense; and less socially-conducive food habits. 'Personalised Nutrition', with extensive and resource-demanding nutrigenomic, metabolomic and microbiomic data may provide partial health solutions in clinical settings, but not be justified for ethical, risk management or sustainability reasons in public health. The globally prevalent multidimensional malnutritional problems of food insecurity, quality and equity require local, regional and global action to prevent further ecosystem degradation as well as to educate, provide sustainable livelihoods and encourage respectful social discourse and practice about the role of food."

Sustainable agricultural systems involve the use of farming practices that protect the environment, public health and human communities. They also ensure animal welfare, protect biodiversity and promote healthy ecosystems. Agricultural scientists recognize that one of the best ways of alleviating the twin scourges of poverty and hunger is through agriculture, i.e., by increasing food production. JCI published a special issue on ‘Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability’ in 2007. In 2009–2010, several articles were published, which specifically addressed important water and agricultural sustainability strategies. In 2013–2014, numerous articles on combating climate change from the standpoint of agriculture were published. The issues at the core of JCI have also been enshrined in the United Nations’ ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs), which were established in 2015.

Most of the harmful effects are found because of nonjudicious uses of agrochemicals, which, by the way of biotransformation, cause several diseases and damage biodiversity. Several government proceedings have made legislations against the use of persistent organic chemicals and recommended the use of biodegradable chemicals for a better greener environment.

Implementing the SDGs as an ‘indivisible whole’ represents the actual litmus test for the success of the 2030 Agenda. The main challenge is accomplishing a more integrated approach to sustainable development that encompasses new governance frameworks for enabling and managing systemic transformations. This thematic issue addresses the question whether and how the SDGs set off processes of societal transformation, for which cooperation between state and non-state actors at all political levels (global, regional, national, sub-national), in different societal spheres (politics, society, and economy), and across various sectors (energy, transportation, food, etc.) are indispensable.

Very quickly though free trade was countered with protectionism in the form of policies favoring national and cultural food security. The traumas of World War led to the introduction of international commitments on individual rights with respect to labor and the right to freedom from hunger. From the seventies, the pendulum swung back in favor of free trade, this time provoking a response in the form of fair and ethical trade. The introduction of new food markets promoted by social movements as from the eighties where values were attached to the conditions and processes of production rather than the product itself led to agriculture and food markets becoming imbued with ethical attributes. At the same time, an increasingly holistic concept of food security became adopted in international forums pointing to the need for policies which were no longer reducible to food aid. While for a period, broader ethical values were identified only with alternative food networks, as from the turn of the new millennium, under the collective umbrella of economic, social and environmental sustainability, they became adopted by the global agri-food players as the triple bottom line for all agricultural and food markets.

Here, we review information on 10 indigenous fruit trees that are considered to be underutilized and explore their occurrence, distribution, nutritional components, phytochemicals, and medicinal potentials, as well as their associated challenges and prospects. The indigenous fruit trees, which occur across different ecological zones in Africa, are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, protein, and valuable phytochemicals.

The key challenges to fruit tree sustainability include indiscriminate and illegal logging, low accessibility, and low acceptability, as well as inadequate research on their cultivation.

The methodology incorporates a quantitative assessment of social, ecological and economic indicators of agricultural sustainability in India, coupled with a co-relation analysis between several nutrition and land-based indicators for leading agriculture states across the country. The results highlight that despite attaining sufficiency in terms of food production, access to food by all in the country remains a major challenge along with incoherence between certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators and their corresponding data values.

Consequently, an umbrella policy (National Policy on Eco-Agri-Food Systems) has been proposed by authors for sustainable management of the country's entire agricultural value chain.

Food (""freedom from want"") is a fundamental human right, and it is acknowledged that there is enough sustenance in the world to feed everyone. Yet, some 800 million people are hungry. Why? It is due to a combination of inequitable distribution and morally indefensible destruction of excess crops to keep market prices attractive for producers and ""big-agro""industry.

This paper considers if productivity in the food sector is a driver of human EV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. We estimate count data specifications of country level human EV infections as a function of food sector productivity in sub-Saharan Africa over the 1976–2013 time period. Our parameter estimates suggest that if productivity in the food sector was on average 1 per cent higher over the 1976–2013 time period, the incidence of human EV infection would have been 42.5 per cent lower. This is consistent with bushmeat being a substitute for food produced in the formal sector, as food productivity increases lower the price of formal food relative to bushmeat.

In the last two decades, urbanists and landscape planners have promoted urban agriculture and food systems with little attention to ecosystem disservices. At present, increased urbanisation, environmental degradation, population growth and changes in food systems require a novel concept that considers trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices. Considering the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030, as well as the food revolution 5.0 of feeding up to ten billion people, edible urbanism 5.0 is a supportive component in reaching these goals. In this comment, edible urbanism via an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach is examined against current urbanistic concepts that have common food production systems in cities. Moreover, a discussion on issues and challenges of public policy and governance for the implementation of sustainable food systems is shown with findings that consider current industrial intensive farming as somewhat unsustainable. Edible urbanism integrates three main principles of sustainability by fulfilling food security, resilience and social inclusion. It links site-specific, best-practices by integrating EGI-based governance with modernised food production techniques.

This paper suggests the role of a sustainable education on the fight against hunger, poverty, and inequalities. If the environmental crisis is not solved, hunger cannot end, especially in underdeveloped countries and regions. Education is, more than ever, an important tool to increase the living standards. Due to sustainable educational processes, we have much more knowledge of how to solve climate problems, reduce poverty and increase food production without destroying Earth resources. Educational processes based on sustainability context also brings the opportunity to rethink the lack of collective coordination, especially among states. We are a civilization that shares the same fate, and together they can build more international cooperation and less competition, and education is a key point to rewrite the human history with no more hunger. Understand how industry and society grow and develop is essential to know how they learn and become productive, and knowledge production, a crucial point in education, already produces countries that are more able than others regarding the development of intensive sectors in state-of-The-Art technology, capable of generating more income, better production and reducing their nourishment vulnerability. These effects can be shared with underdeveloped ones. Innovation has been a crucial part of the most developed economies throughout history. The rise of living standards should be attributed to the technological progress, in learning how to do things better. A sustainable educational system is a crucial support to reduce knowledge inequality between developed and underdeveloped countries and help ones with learning difficulties, able to create learning societies free from hunger. © 2017 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

However domestic RWH usually focuses on in-house usage such as toilet flushing and washing, while there has been very little research specific to its use in food production. In developing countries home gardens often fail due to insufficient rainfall and water supply. In general, promoting urban agriculture and the greening of cities begs the question of whether there is sufficient water available to support it and where additional water will come from. A scoping review following a five step criteria is adopted here to understand the extent to which roof harvested rainwater can be used to support urban agriculture and what are the associated economic implications. In view of the broad scope of the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus, under which this research fits, this scoping review is deemed better suited (in absence of an ample body of literature) to the synthesis of relevant researches than a systematic review. The major contributions of this review are to highlight the lack of initiatives to utilise harvested rainwater in urban agriculture, to explore the obstacles and to lay a foundation for new areas of research within the sustainable urban development paradigm. Furthermore, the comparison between developed and developing countries helps bring to light cultural, socio-economic and political obstacles to improving sustainability and healthier living in the urban environment. The impact of history and traditions on crop choice, growing methods and consequently water consumption rates are also discussed. This review is particularly relevant to three of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (i.e. Cleaner and Sustainable Cities; Health and Wellbeing and No Hunger). It is found that there is a considerable potential to supply water to urban agriculture using customised roof RWH system designs. For example, one study reports that up to 41% of urban horticulture sites in Rome could be sustained by water harvested from local roofs. Irrigating a small garden (20 m2) with harvested rainwater can increase the yield by about 20% meeting the caloric requirements of a typical Indian household. Further research is needed on the integration of roof rainwater harvesting and urban agriculture to maximise its contribution to food production and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Nonetheless, this intensive model - and the related globalized processing and marketing system – poses a challenge to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. In addition, volatility on world cereal markets is threatening farmers' income, triggering diversification patterns. One of this pattern is the creation of alternative food chains intended as supply chains that are territorially embedded and able to reconnect producers with consumers. In this context, this paper aims to explore the diversity of alternative bread chains and valorisation practices, in order to identify organizational models, assess their economic performance in terms of creating added value distributing it along the stages of the chain and to understand the role played by ancient wheat varieties in differentiating the product. In order to do this, the paper develops a comparative case study analysis of several locally-based alternative bread supply chains in Tuscany (Italy). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors, selected considering all the steps in the supply chain: from growing the wheat and milling the grain through to the end product. From these interviews differences emerged between locally-based bread supply chains in terms of the valorisation system followed and the institutional arrangements. While the locally-based chains featuring modern wheat varieties have more conventional characteristics and pursue differentiation strategies based on certification, chains based on ancient wheat follow a more informal route, and product quality is mainly guaranteed by the reputation of the network. Furthermore, in the bread supply chains featuring ancient varieties, the methods for reducing transaction costs are linked to a bottom-up collective action, embeddedness strategies among stakeholders (that include also consumers), and are built on a relational approach based on trust, knowledge exchange and social networks. Results provide an assessment of the performances of different locally-based bread supply chains, identify critical aspects and suggest some policy implications for all types of chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Zimbabwe is no exception, as motivated by the Sustainable Development Goals of 2015 which aims at attaining zero hunger by 2030 and the New Urban Agenda which envisions that cities and huan settlements must provide access to quality services in the form of food nutrition and security. Through Zimbabwe’s regulatory framework, the Environmental Management Act and the Urban Councils Act, have been used as tools to promote food waste reuse and recycling hence, the reduction in food waste through recycling at household and even at commercial levels. However, local authorities suffer from a lack of capacity to effectively collect waste hence, the need to effectively deal with issues regarding food waste from the household level. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has also threatened food security in the African region and hence, the need to effectively maximise on food recycling and reuse measures. The chapter concludes that food waste recycling and reuse are an essential component for urban environments to thrive excellently, as this does not only cut on food waste to guarantee food security for the poor, but also promotes healthier and cleaner working and living environments for the populace. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Global concerns over climate change, resource use, pollution and other environmental indicators means that producers must implement practices and systems to reduce environmental impacts, yet this may only be achieved through assessments that allow impacts to be quantified, benchmarked and improved over time. Although environmental indicators are widely accepted, the metrics by which these are assessed continue to evolve over time as assessment objectives gain clarity and focus, and as the science relating to controversial topics (e.g. global warming or carbon sequestration) becomes more refined. However, significant negative trade-offs may occur between different metrics and denominators such that a specific practice or system may appear to have greater or lesser impacts, depending on assessment methodology. A number of tools and models have been developed to empower producers in quantifying environmental impacts, which will be increasingly important in satisfying future consumers’ hunger for information as well as food.These tools must be supplied in tandem with information as to the potential consequences of changing management practices and systems. At present however, tools available are based on differing methodologies, are often opaque in their background calculations and do not necessarily account for all the factors that influence environmental impacts from livestock. There is a clear need for robust tools that can be used as standards for assessing environmental impacts from the global livestock industry and that go beyond GHG emissions to produce a more rounded holistic assessment. © CAB International 2021."

The fertilizer value of nutrients excreted from an individual and production increase by recycling/reusing those same nutrients to grow crops have been calculated for four countries each from Sub-Saharan Africa (Burundi, Burkina Faso, Congo, and Malawi) and Asia (China, India, Maldives, and Nepal). The data related to sanitation coverage, fertilizer application rate, agricultural productivity, and dietary energy supply (intake) were collected from various sources and analyzed. Estimations of fertilizer equivalents of nutrients excreted and additional production increase due to nutrient recycling and reuse have been calculated using established equations. The cost for providing sanitation (toilet technologies) services is calculated based on the fraction of people practicing open defecation (OD). The investment needed to provide sanitation services on urine diverted (UD) mode and payback period considering only the economic benefit from fertilizers reused for crop production (i.e. without considering benefits from reduced mortality/morbidity rates, better environmental and public health practices etc) is reported. Calculations show that in countries like Burkina Faso and Malawi with undernourishment >20%, the cost of UST system can be recovered in around 20 years only by considering the nutrient value in excreta. And approximately 55 kg/p.y and 77 kg/p.y of cereals would be added to the food chain in Burkina Faso and Malawi, respectively. If other intangible benefits (like reduction in morbidity and mortality, improved health, and time savings due to improved services etc.) were considered, the cost of installing USTs can be recovered well within the acceptable life time of sanitation systems (Table 2).

Further, it has recently been suggested that the focus of food aid activities is shifting from food poverty and temporary hunger alleviation towards environmental sustainability through addressing food waste via organized re-distribution of expiring food from retail to charitable organizations. This potentially creates a mechanism that (1) solidifies food poverty and (2) fortifies the paradoxical situation where charitable organizations delivering food aid are dependent on food waste rather than trying to reduce it. To understand the process that has led to this shift, a longitudinal media data analysis on the evolution of the discussion and the interpretations on CFA is presented. By conducting an inductive frame analysis, the paper answers three key questions: How was CFA framed by and through the media in Finland between 1995 and 2016? Has any single frame dominated the discussion at any given point? Finally, what are the characteristics of the frame that focuses on food surplus redistribution? The results suggest that when the practices are framed as potential receivers and redistributors of surplus, perception of CFA is mainly favourable and the root causes for food insecurity are not addressed. Thus, by focusing on environmental sustainability, food aid practices—hitherto depoliticized as a poverty problem—have gained policy relevance in the discursive space of the circular economy; perhaps at the cost of poverty policy and with unintended consequences. © 2019, The Author(s)."

Despite this renewed interest and increased commitments to invest in agricultural development, there is an outstanding debate over the technological trajectories to sustainability. The debate centres on sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) and agroecological intensification (AEI) pathways to agricultural sustainability. Using a systematic literature review approach, this study examines the debate over AEI and SAI. This study employs a theoretical framework based on the economic, social, and ecological dimensions of sustainable agriculture within a policy and institutional space. Based on the sustainability dimensions, a discourse analytical technique is applied to unravel the debate. The results reveal differences in actor composition in the SAI and AEI pathways. Both pathways aim to promote food security with optimal and sustainable use of inputs; however, the actors differ on discourse relating to the concept of farming, the role of genetic engineering, the scale of operation, land use and soil health. Resolving these differences requires a blended sustainability approach that moves beyond the current AEI and SAI debate by acknowledging the tradeoffs and synergies of the socio-economic and ecological dimensions. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

To feed 10 billion persons 2050, we need to get the trade-offs right between sustainability, food security, food safety, and make better use of food already produced. The hierarchy of strategies for reducing food losses and waste are in descending order source reduction, reusing or reprocessing surplus foods, recycle food as feed for animals, recover the energy as biofuels, nutrients as compost, or raw materials for industry, while as last resorts one may consider recovering the energy by incineration or dumping as garbage in landfills. This paper will explore the trade-offs inherent when aiming at triple goals of sustainability, food security, and safety looking at these strategies for reducing food losses and waste and resource footprints. Intensification of food production and circular food systems could be parts of these solutions to future food security. In this regard could our future trade-offs be informed by the experiences from the use of antimicrobials to intensify food production and from the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in terms of circular food production? There is no trade-off between intensification of food production aided by antimicrobials and the public health risks from antimicrobial resistance due to the zoo-technical use of antimicrobials. A sustainable future requires control of antimicrobial resistance. If one avoids that cycles of nutrients become cycles of pathogens and/or hazards, circular food production systems will a major contribution to the future sustainable food security. Source reduction i.e., limiting food losses and waste appears to the strategy most promising for achieving sustainability. By using artificial intelligence and intelligent packaging major progress is possible, with the added benefit of better control of food fraud. A changed diet—eating more plant-based foods and not eating animal protein produced by edible feedstuffs, and source reduction of the food lost or wasted should enable us to feed at least an additional billion persons.

The HPNAP improves nutritional quality of food available at food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency shelters through contractual relationships to fund the purchase, delivery, storage, and service of nutritious food. Objective: To determine whether a one-time fiscal stimulus of the Locally Grown Produce Initiative to HPNAP contractors in 2012-2013 would result in a short-term sustainable increase in the proportion of dollars spent on New York State Grown (NYSG) produce. Design: Quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design. We analyzed New York State Department of Health administrative data regarding expenditures on all produce and NYSG produce by HPNAP contractors. Setting: New York State. Outcome Measures: The proportion of dollars spent on NYSG produce during 2011-2012 (preintervention) and 2013-2014 (postintervention) was compared between HPNAP food bank contractors (recipients of stimulus money, n = 8) and non-food bank contractors (nonrecipients, n = 34) using nonparametric methods. Results: The HPNAP Locally Grown Produce Initiative was associated with an increased proportion of NYSG produce spending by food bank contractors that received a fiscal stimulus 1 year later. Upstate food banks had the largest increase (median 31.6%) among all HPNAP contractors. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the Locally Grown Produce Initiative fiscal stimulus had a positive, year-long and statewide effect on the proportion of expenditure on NYSG produce by food banks.

These malnourished people live in developing countries and rely upon staple foods routinely with inability to either afford for dietary diversification or pharmaceutical supplementation or industrial fortification of minerals. Biofortification is a strategy that can tackle hidden hunger merely through staple foods that people eat every day. This strategy can be achieved through agronomic practices and conventional breeding and genetic engineering approaches, and each has their own pros and cons. The sustainability of such grain fortification with higher seed mineral concentration is soil health dependent, especially on the availability of mineral in the rhizosphere. Microorganisms, the invisible engineers in improving the soil health by solubilizing trace elements and by driving various biogeochemical cycles of soil, have the ability to serve as a key solution for this complex issue. In specific, plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbes reside in root-soil interface and employ the use of siderophores, organic acids, and exopolysaccharides for increasing the mineral availability and subsequent mobilization to the plants. Increasing the seed mineral density with the use of such PGP microbes, especially actinomycetes, is in its infancy. Hence, this chapter is aimed to bring a view on the role of microbes, especially actinomycetes, with metal-mobilizing and PGP traits for biofortification as this strategy may act as a complementary sustainable tool for the existing biofortification strategies. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016."

The food demand will increase and agricultural activities need modification to satisfy the hunger and nutrition requirements of this up-surging population. The demand for productive agricultural land will be increased. The environmentally sustainable system needs to be introduced to maintain the level of production and the quality of food. The increasing greenhouse gases are the cause of climate change, due to industrialization. The agricultural activities are particularly affected by the environmental issues, including climatic alterations, increasing scarcity of water resource. The movement of populations from rural to urban areas will increase the burden on resources. That is the reason the agricultural practices needed to be renewed by undertaking the ecological, economic, and social aspects of agriculture sector. Moreover, the food and nutrition requirements in the increasing population of developing and resource-scarce countries, especially in Asia and Africa is a challenge. These countries are already poor and resource scarce, and the phenomenon of climate change is adding further challenges for the agriculture practice of small-scale farmers. This review presents the science-based evidence of climate change effect on crops. So the sustainable modifications in agricultural activities should be made by keeping in view these effects.

Today's food systems fail to realize the normative foundations of ecological economics: justice, sustainability, efficiency, and value pluralism. Drawing on empirical and theoretical literature from diverse intellectual traditions, I argue that markets, as an institution for governing food systems, hinder the realization of these objectives. Markets allocate food toward money, not hunger. They encourage shifting costs on others, including nonhuman nature. They rarely signal unsustainability, and in many ways cause it. They do not resemble the efficient markets of economic theory. They organize food systems according to exchange value at the expense of all other social, cultural, spiritual, moral, and environmental values. I argue that food systems can approach the objectives of ecological economics roughly to the degree that they subordinate market mechanisms to social institutions that embody those values. But such ""embedding"" processes, whether through creating state policy or alternative markets, face steep barriers and can only partially remedy food markets' inherent shortcomings. Thus, ecological economists should also study, promote, and theorize non-market food systems. © 2019 by the authors."

The inclusion of sustainability characteristics in New Zealand’s (NZ) eating and activity guidelines (EAGs) may lead to achieving sustainable diets. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement among sectoral professionals of including sustainability characteristics within the guidelines. Methods: Agriculture, environment, and health sector professionals were invited to complete an online survey to establish agreement with sustainability characteristics and sustainability statements. Opinion and attitude questions were completed using a 5-item Likert scale. One-way ANOVA analyses were conducted to compare the level of agreement and differences in means of the sector levels of agreement whilst controlling for covariates. Post-hoc tests were used to determine sectoral differences. Results: Overall, 298 (65% female) respondents completed the survey from the agriculture (37%), environment (22%), and health (41%) sectors. Two-thirds (66%) of respondents were over 35 years and 90% had a tertiary education. Two-thirds (63%) of respondents disagreed that NZ’s current food system is sustainable; health (77%) and environment (78%) sector respondents had greater disagreement than those from agriculture (35%; P = 0.00). Overall, 77% of respondents agreed that sustainability characteristics should be included in guidelines; health (90%) and environment (84%) sector respondents had greater agreement than from agriculture (58%; P = 0.00). Five sustainability characteristics received high levels of agreement (>90%) for inclusion: dietary diversity, sustainable seafood, limit processed foods, reduced food waste, and sustainable lifestyle behaviours. Agreement for eight sustainability characteristics was highest among the health and environment sectors vs. the agricultural sector (P < 0.05). A relatively low level of agreement was received from all three sectors, particularly the environmental sector (68.7%), towards the characteristic “to consume recommended serves of dairy products.” Only 38.5% of all respondents agreed with the inclusion of “organic food produce.” Negative associations were observed between respondents’ opinions regarding the sustainability of NZ’s current food system and familiarity with the EAGs.

However, groundwater reliance is rising due to lack of canal water and is often inferior quality, costly, scarce, and ultimately expensive for smallholders. Moreover, as hunger rises daily due to population growth, additional irrigation water systems are needed to extend the cropping patterns. Therefore, wastewater (WW) use in agriculture has been increased on a growing scale over the last decades due to its fertilizing capacity and decrease in canal water and freshwater availability. It enhances soil productivity by contributing organic matter contents and preserves water and nutrients for plants. Various traditional treatments such as primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments are being used, but more working is required due to health and environmental issues. Therefore, the end product of tertiary treatments could be mixed with different water sources (for dilution), phytoremediator plants in channels and use of microbes that eat waste food could be adopted because the maximum crop yield is primarily determined by water quality, as well as climatic conditions, water management practices, chemical and physical soil properties. Besides, we can minimize the all-potential risks associated with agricultural activities and production via strengthened strategies, systemic dialogues, and financial frameworks.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the rising global demand for food in a sustainable manner (the most recent estimates tell us that about one billion people go hungry or are malnourished). Furthermore, a great number of factors contribute to uncertainty about the world's ability to meet the food demand of an increasing population. For all that reasons, food security must be put on top of the policy agenda."

We owe the oceans the very air we breathe. Oceans are storehouses of nutrient rich food that can alleviate the hunger of many generations to come, offer rich minerals and medicines to cure many diseases, regulate the temperature of our planet, stabilize weather patterns, and provide livelihood for many in the fishing and tourism industry. But sadly they are overexploited and polluted to the core. The very fact that these mighty oceans have started showing the ill effects of anthropogenic activities itself is testimony to the tremendous greed of humanity. Among all the mighty oceans, the Arctic ocean is the most sensitive and vulnerable to these changes as it holds a pivotal position in maintaining life on Earth by different mechanisms. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 of the United Nations underlines the urgent need to conserve marine resources and give equal rights to people in all countries to enjoy these resources. The current review is an attempt to highlight the enormous number of ways in which oceans have helped humankind, the serious threats the oceans are facing now, and how best we can have a sustainable approach to halt the total crashing of our great ocean systems. © 2021 Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal of Religions and Philosophies (DVK, Bangalore)."

It relies extensively on qualitative data collected in Glasgow and Ogoniland between 2013 and 2016. Results show that although the concept of food bank is more widespread and established in Glasgow than in Ogoniland, both Glaswegians and Ogonis are increasingly becoming dependent on food banks. In Glasgow, food banks have moved from being last, and short-term, resorts, to becoming permanent means of alleviating hunger. However, the managers of these food banks are clearly unsure about their long-term sustainability, and this paper argues that the established model of food bank operating in Glasgow should not be replicated in Ogoniland. Instead, using Freire's concept of ‘education for critical consciousness', we suggest an alternative model for food banks that shifts the focus from alleviating hunger to tackling the causes of poverty, that is, a shift from dependency to independency. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Whether these changes are transient or sustained remains unclear. This study aimed to assess if changes in subjective and objective appetite markers observed with WL are sustained after 1 year (1Y). Subjects/Methods: In total 100 (45 males) individuals with obesity (BMI: 37 ± 4 kg/m                             2                             , age: 43 ± 10 years) underwent 8 weeks (wks) of a very-low energy diet (VLED), followed by 4 wks refeeding, and a 1Y maintenance program. Fasting/postprandial subjective ratings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption (PFC) were assessed, and plasma concentration of active ghrelin (AG), total peptide YY (PYY), active glucagon-like peptide 1, cholecystokinin (CCK), and insulin measured, at baseline, week 13 (Wk13) and 1Y. Results: At Wk13, 16% WL (−18 ± 1 kg, P < 0.001) was associated with a significant increase in fasting and postprandial hunger ratings (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), and postprandial fullness (P < 0.01) combined with a reduction in PFC (P < 0.001). These were accompanied by a significant rise in basal and postprandial AG concentrations (P < 0.001, for both), a reduction in postprandial CCK (P < 0.01) and in basal and postprandial insulin (P < 0.001). At 1Y follow-up, with sustained WL (15%; −16 ± 1 kg, P < 0.001), fasting hunger and postprandial fullness ratings remained increased (P < 0.05 for both), and postprandial PFC reduced (P < 0.001). Basal and postprandial AG remained elevated and insulin reduced (P < 0.001, for all), while postprandial CCK was increased (P < 0.01) and PYY decreased (P < 0.001). Conclusion: With a 15% sustained WL at 1Y, the drive to eat in the fasting state is increased, but this may be balanced out by raised postprandial feelings of fullness. To assist with WL maintenance, new strategies are required to manage increased hunger and drive to eat.                          © 2018, The Author(s)."

The traditional way products are designed promotes a linear economy that discards recoverable resources and creates negative environmental and social impacts. Here, we suggest multi-disciplinary approaches encompassing chemistry, process engineering and sustainability science, and sustainable solutions in ""game changer"" challenges in three intersecting arenas of food: Sustainable diet, valorisation of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, and circularity of food value chain systems aligning with the United Nations' seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. In the arena of sustainable diet, comprehensive life cycle assessment using the global life cycle inventory datasets and recommended daily servings is conducted to rank food choices, covering all food groups from fresh fruits/vegetables, lentils/pulses and grains to livestock, with regard to health and the environment, to emphasise the essence of plant-based diet, especially plant-based sources of protein, for holistic systemic sustainability and stability of the earth system. In the arena of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, economically feasible and synergistically (energy and material) integrated innovative biorefinery systems are suggested to transform unavoidable food waste into functional and platform chemical productions alongside energy vectors: Fuel or combined heat and power generation. In the arena of circularity of food value chain systems, novel materials and methods for plant-based protein functionalisation for food/nutraceutical applications are investigated using regenerative bio-surfactants from unavoidable food waste. This circular economy or industrial symbiosis example thus combines the other two arenas, i.e., plant-based protein sourcing and unavoidable food waste valorisation. The multi-disciplinary analysis here will eventually impact on policies for dietary change, but also contribute knowledge needed by industry and policy makers and raise awareness amongst the population at large for making a better approach to the circular economy of food. © 2020 by the authors."

The literature on the commons has extensively studied examples of local common-pool resources following Ostrom’s lead, and Ostrom’s design principles have been used to analyze the governing mechanisms of seeds in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. However, various limitations, including that of scale or of diversity in the stakeholders involved in the commons, render the parallel insufficient to fully understand why the Treaty is not reaching its objectives of food security and sustainable agriculture. I believe that in the current state of the debate, discussion on (common) property rights over seeds remains crucial to understand these failures. Therefore, using the literature of the commons, this chapter explores how to enable the Treaty stakeholders to create a sustainable and inclusive global seed commons so as to best reach their set goals of food security and sustainable agriculture. Building on a thorough transdisciplinary study of the Multilateral System of access and benefit-sharing of the ITPGRFA, six invariable principles are identified as core elements of an efficient global seed commons: (1) sustainability; (2) interdependence; (3) the anticommons dilemma; (4) the physical and informational components inextricably bound to the use of seeds; (5) the Global seed community and (6) diversity, heterogeneity and complexity. It is argued that these invariable principles should be better articulated in the tools, rules and procedures of the global seed commons in order to realize the Treaty’s overall goals. The six invariable principles are not design principles which have to be adapted to a specific resources commons regime. In my view, these invariable principles express the very essence of seeds evolution: they constitute core principles enabling the existence of seed diversity. Humans cannot continue to avoid respecting them when designing the commons regime to govern the global seed commons. In conclusion, I plead for a truly ‘global seed commons’ to be redesigned using the identified invariable principles, during the ongoing review process of the Treaty, i.e., one that voices all its stakeholders. Only then could major social challenges be faced, such as producing sufficient and quality food in times of climate changes and persisting world hunger and poverty. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Fabien Girard and Christine Frison; individual chapters, the contributors."

All of these qualities are envisioned without requiring fossil fuels to plant and harvest our crops thereby eliminating those carbon emissions into our current carbon cycle. Accomplishment will be an indication that we have whipped our unsustainable, disastrous addiction to oil and our institutionalized assumption that the current trend of farm (spatial) size increase is necessary. The properly designed, developed, and deployed SCCS enables the possibility of this vision coming to fruition. As noted, this vision, however, requires us to recover from our unsustainable addiction to oil and to reassess our current assumptions that are based on cheap oil and that economies of “scale” have the same impact on the farm as it has in industry.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an example of incorporating racial equity, poverty, and structural policies into human health improvement. But theories must be put into action if they are to make a difference. A major research hospital’s global health division convened a workshop of fifty-five community, civic, and public health leaders to adapt the health-related SDGs to Detroit’s context and challenges. Four breakout workgroup sessions were held, covering hunger and food security (SDG 2), health and wellbeing for all (SDG 3), sustainable water and sanitation (SDG 6), and urban development and safety (SDG 11). The strongest conclusion to emerge was that progress on the SDGs in cities like Detroit will not be possible without building a more comprehensive and inclusive public health infrastructure. This needs to be a priority at the federal, state, regional, and local levels. The SDGs provide an exciting framework for global change. In an emerging model of translocalism, Detroit can learn best practices from cities around the world with similar challenges while sharing its own lessons.

To reach the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) of ending hunger globally (SDG #2) and achieving sustainable consumption and production (SDG #12), this food production system needs to change. Recent years have seen the rise in popularity of the vegan or plant-based diet among consumers, which can go some way to reducing the environmental burden. This trend has motivated pioneering food producers to develop innovative vegan food products for niche markets, thus driving the sustainability transition of the food sector. Scope and approach: This commentary tracks how three pioneering food companies have responded to the vegan trend in Europe. From the analysis of the sustainable innovation journeys of these innovative food producers, we propose a framework that presents a multi-level perspective on the socio-technical transition of the food production and consumption system. Key findings and conclusions: The findings show how food producers, incumbents, and new entrants progress through an early phase of planning a direction and establishing a goal, followed by pivoting and experimenting in response to changes in the business environment. This innovation journey concludes as the company moves from experimentation and learning activities onto innovation implementation. The paper postulates a model that describes how regime level changes arise from the microfoundations of the food production and consumption system, as the innovation journeys of companies drive institutional change towards sustainability.

This, in turn, depends on clear and universally applicable targets and indicators which are partially lacking. The novel and complex nature of the SDGs poses further challenges to their implementation on the ground, especially in the face of interlinkages across SDG objectives and scales. Here we review the existing SDG-2 indicators, propose improvements to facilitate their operationalization, and illustrate their practical implementation in Nigeria, Brazil and the Netherlands. This exercise provides insights into the concrete actions needed to achieve SDG-2 across contrasting development contexts and highlights the challenges of addressing the links between targets and indicators within and beyond SDG-2. Ultimately, it underscores the need for integrated policies and reveals opportunities to leverage the fulfillment of SDG-2 worldwide. © 2018, The Author(s)."

The crop is rich in both macro-and micronutrients compared with other vegetables and is suitable for ensuring food and nutritional security. It also possesses several medicinal properties and is currently employed in the treatment of high blood pressure, diabetes, cholera, uterine complaints as well as skin infections in humans. The crop is predominantly cultivated by traditional farmers and plays an important role in the subsistence and economy of poor farmers and consumers throughout the developing world. It also holds potential for dietary diversification, greater genetic biodiversity and sustainable production in Africa. Despite the numerous benefits the crop presents, it remains neglected and underutilized due to the world’s over-dependence on a few plant species, as well as the little attention in research and development it has received over the years. This review highlights the importance of S. aethiopicum, its role in crop diversification, reducing hidden hunger, the potential for nutritive and medicinal benefits, agricultural sustainability and future thrusts for breeding and genetic improvement of the plant species. © 2021 by the authors.

Trade-offs and synergies arise between strategies to achieve any one of these targets, which complicates the use of evidence to guide policies and investments since most analyses focus solely on one objective. This gives rise to ‘blind spots’ in the evidence base, where acting to achieve one objective can have strong impacts on achieving others, hampering attempts to establish a systematic approach to attaining the multiple objectives of SDG 2. Here, we focus on three key blind spots that arise from potential interactions between increasing agricultural productivity and enhancing the sustainability of food production systems, eradicating hunger and malnutrition, and increasing the resilience of food production systems to climate change. Incorporating the consideration of synergies and trade-offs into policy-making is also essential; however, there is relatively little evidence of this occurring in national policies to date. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited."

Yet rigorous evidence on social and environmental outcomes of sustainable development policies remains scarce. We conduct a national-level analysis of Brazil’s flagship social protection program, Zero Hunger (ZH), which aims to reduce food insecurity and poverty. Using data from rural municipalities across Brazil and quasi-experimental causal inference techniques, we assess relationships between social protection investment and outcomes related to sustainable development goals (SDGs): ""no poverty"" (SDG 1), ""zero hunger"" (SDG 2), and ""health and well being"" (SDG 3). We also assess potential perverse outcomes arising from agricultural development impacting ""climate action"" (SDG 13) and ""life on land"" (SDG 15) via clearance of natural vegetation. Despite increasing daily per capita protein and kilocalorie production, summed ZH investment did not alleviate child malnutrition or infant mortality and negligibly influenced multidimensional poverty. Higher investment increased natural vegetation cover in some biomes but increased losses in the Cerrado and especially the Pampa. Effects varied substantially across subprograms. Conditional cash transfer (Bolsa Familia [BF]) was mainly associated with nonbeneficial impacts but increased protein production and improved educational participation in some states. The National Program to Strengthen Family Farming (PRONAF) was typically associated with increased food production (protein and calories), multidimensional poverty alleviation, and changes in natural vegetation. Our results inform policy development by highlighting successful elements of Brazil’s ZH program, variable outcomes across divergent food security dimensions, and synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development goals, including environmental protection. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Nourishing the expected global population of nine billion in the face of fast diminishing land and water resources and looming climate change has tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications. Furthermore, whereas much past work on food security had focused on feeding the world through more staple crop calories, the current emphasis is on nourishing the global population through the provision of a more nutrient-rich diet. Hence the focus on micronutrient deficiencies (so-called 'hidden hunger'), dietary diversity, and the nutrient density of the food supply-all critical components of overall nutritional status. To aid future assessments of 'sustainable nutrition security', we need a new methodology and some novel assessment metrics and tools. Seven metrics are proposed, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) nutrient adequacy of foods and diets; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). The metrics can be combined with simulation models and then deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of targeted food system interventions.

Specifically, it provides a conceptual framework where key factors related to the acceptance and adoption of insects and insects based foods are identified. This paper takes a sociocultural, symbolic and contextual perspective to offer marketers and public policymakers a set of recommendations to promote entomophagy as a sustainable and healthy food practice to help consumers achieve their FWB. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, first, the authors review the literature on entomophagy from its rise to establishment in different food cultures by considering two main perspectives as follows: historical and sociocultural. Second, the authors review the salience of entomophagy as an important AFC capable of addressing sustainability and food health issues. Finally, the authors propose a framework in which the authors define key factors related to the acceptance and adoption of an insects-based diet in Western food cultures. The identification of these factors will help marketing and public policymakers to set up educational programs and strategies to promote entomophagy as a sustainable and healthy food practice within different Western food cultures, and thus, help consumers to achieve their FWB. Findings: To identify the key factors influencing the acceptance of entomophagy as AFC, this paper provides a summary of the core motivators characterizing the acceptance and adoption of insects and insect-based foods in Western food cultures. Specifically, the authors identify the key factors influencing the acceptance of entomophagy as food consumption in Western food cultures and based on the extant literature by Batat et al. (2017) the authors provide an entomophagy framework that includes both idiocentric and allocentric factors considering the adoption of insects and insect-based foods in Western food cultures. Table I provides a summary. Social implications: The authors believe entomophagy has the potential to generate societal benefits, as its appeal at the social (hunger in the world), environmental (reducing meat consumption and its impact on ecology) and health (less calories and nutritive food) level. Originality/value: The research contributes to creating new knowledge that simulates debate among public policy and marketing scholars about entomophagy as a novel food in Western food cultures. The focus on key factors related to its acceptance and adoption of Western food cultures calls for empirical evidence to be tested in the marketplace using possibly different insect categories and other novel foods. Further, the framework should stimulate thinking about ways the authors can change consumers’ negative perceptions of disgusting food. Marketers and policymakers can achieve it by making their practices more efficient in terms of promoting sustainable AFC, as well as with efficient policy initiatives focused on supporting AFC, including the regulation of insect introduction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Exploring these neglected resources, for example, the Transvaal red milkwood tree [(Mimusops zeyheri) Sond. family: Sapotaceae] is of paramount importance for food and nutritional security as well as economic prosperity. This review provides a critical appraisal of the nutritional and health benefits as well as the economic potential of Mimusops zeyheri. The plant is known for its diverse uses among rural communities. In folk medicine, the decoction from the bark and leaves of Mimusops zeyheri are used for treating wounds and ulcers, while the root is used as an infusion taken to treat candidiasis and other health issues. The nutritional profile of the fruit tree is similar to popular exotic fruits and richer in vitamin C when compared to guava and orange. Mimusops zeyheri is a rich source of vitamins, protein, and fatty acids. Based on the rich chemical pool, especially in the fruit and seeds, it has the potential to provide an accessible, readily available, and affordable enriched functional food with valuable health benefits. However, the successful exploration of Mimusops zeyheri for food security and sustainability requires multidisciplinary research. This will help achieve the envisaged food-nutrition security and poverty alleviation potential of the plant, especially among local communities. © 2020 by the authors.

They are also recognised by the international community and called upon to orient action towards the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the fulfilment of sustainable development goals. The aim of the present paper is to briefly consider some of the links between these two notions in order to facilitate the operationalisation of the concept of sustainable diet. The concept of sustainable diet was defined in 2010 combining two totally different perspectives: a nutrition perspective, focused on individuals, and a global sustainability perspective, in all its dimensions: environmental, economic and social. The nutrition perspective can be easily related to health outcomes. The global sustainability perspective is more difficult to analyse directly. We propose that it be measured as the contribution of a diet to the sustainability of food systems. Such an approach, covering the three dimensions of sustainability, enables identification of interactions and interrelations between food systems and diets. It provides opportunities to find levers of change towards sustainability. Diets are both the results and the drivers of food systems. The drivers of change for those variously involved, consumers and private individuals, are different, and can be triggered by different dimensions (heath, environment, social and cultural). Combining different dimensions and reasons for change can help facilitate the transition to sustainable diets, recognising the food system's specificities. The adoption of sustainable diets can be facilitated and enabled by food systems, and by appropriate policies and incentives.

The study examined the sustainability responses to climate-smart adaptation and the implication it has for explaining the food security situations among farm households in the Central Region of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: We estimated Heckit treatment effect model to analyse cross-sectional data collected from randomly selected farmers in the Central Region. Findings: Analysis of farm sustainability index suggests that farmers' agricultural practices in response to climate change are lowly or moderately sustainable. We further found that while majority of the farm households are severely food insecure or food insecure with hunger, only about one-third are food insecure without hunger and the remaining few being food secure. The sustainability of farm practices is being impacted by the farmers’ choice of climate smart adaptation measures at the farm level. Consequently, the farm households' food security situation is found to be improved when sustainable farming practices are employed in the face of managing climate change effects. Practical implications: Conclusions drawn from the study findings give rooms for policy implications that suggest responsibilities for policymakers, farmers and other stakeholders to promote CSA practices in food crop production in Ghana. These policy implications will contribute to improve crop productivity, increase incomes and thus enhance food security among farm families. Awareness campaign about benefits of CSA practices and technologies need to be strengthened among farmers in Ghana by government and NGOs that matter in promoting farm resilience to climate change. Given the important impacts of sustainable farm practices on household food security situation, policies that seek to build the adaptive capacity of farmers to climate vulnerability impacts should take into consideration the sustainability dimensions of the adaptation and mitigation measures to be advocated for use at farm levels. Originality/value: Our paper contributes to literature knowledge on climate-smart adaptation practices effect on food security as evidenced in some recent literature. The paper makes a unique contribution by highlighting the food security implication of the sustainability impact of CSA practices, thereby exploring sustainability as an impact pathway between climate smart adaptations practices and food security in a developing country like Ghana.

However, feeding a growing world population by increasing food production without implementing more sustainable consumption will threaten the environment. We explore alternative hunger eradication scenarios that do not compromise environmental protection. We find that an economy-growth-oriented scenario, which ignores inequitable food distribution and is aimed at ending hunger by increasing overall food availability, would require about 20% more food production, 48 Mha of additional agricultural land and would increase greenhouse gas emissions by 550 Mt of CO2 equivalents yr−1 in 2030, compared with the business-as-usual scenario. If hunger eradication efforts were focused solely on the under-nourished, food demand would increase by only 3%, and the associated environmental trade-offs would be largely reduced. Moreover, a combined scenario that targets the under-nourished while also reducing over-consumption, food waste, agricultural intensification and other environmental impacts would reduce food demand by 9% compared with the business-as-usual scenario and would lead to the multiple benefits of reducing hunger and contributing to environmental sustainability. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

The way food is consumed and produced affects the human well-being as well as the environment. Avoiding food losses and adopting a balanced healthy diet is also an important step towards sustainability. Promoting dietary standards and monitoring their adoption is a potentially important policy tool for mitigating environmental impacts of food production as well as monitoring food security and nutrition. There is relatively little research to measure nutritional adequacy of food intake according to dietary standards, and to explore the relationship with health outcomes. In this study we choose the well-established WHO global-level dietary recommendations as a reference to quantify nutritional adequacy by developing an energy and macronutrient intake index (ENI), and to assess its relation to indicators of hunger and undernutrition. We find strong negative association between nutritional adequacy of dietary intake and prevalence of undernutrition at national level, and we illustrate that ENI could be an effective tool to inform national food security strategies. Under different future socioeconomic development scenarios, almost all sub-Saharan African countries achieve an adequate per capita energy intake level but their nutritional status varies with many countries deviating from recommended levels because of the unbalanced development of macronutrient intake levels; more improvement exists in fat and energy intake levels and less agreement in fruit-vegetable and animal protein intake levels. Scenario application proves that the relationship between ENI and undernutrition could readily be applied in future scenarios generated by integrated assessment models to provide insights into the impacts of various climate change scenarios, socioeconomic development pathways and alternative global trade policies on global hunger and undernutrition status. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2), Zero Hunger, seeks to simultaneously address global environmental sustainability and food security challenges. We conducted an integrated literature review organized around three disciplinary perspectives central to realizing SDG 2: ecology and agricultural sciences, nutrition and public health, and political economy and policy science. Within each discipline we first draw on a wide range of literature to summarize the state of knowledge on effective pathways to achieve food security while ensuring the sustainability of food systems. We then conduct a comprehensive review of articles in each of these disciplines that discuss SDG 2, using the pathways we outline initially to frame our analysis. In particular, we ask whether the framing of SDG 2 is appropriate given current understandings of transitions to sustainable food systems. By applying a food systems lens, our review identifies several limitations in the way SDG 2 is applied by researchers including a productionist perspective, limited attention to ecological processes on farms, a definition of food security that lacks a food systems perspective, and a lack of attention to historical and structural factors that shape opportunities for equity and food security in different contexts. Finally, we consider possibilities for expanding the research agenda and associated implications for development practice. We argue that the pathway to achieving Zero Hunger should center on place-based, adaptive, participatory solutions that simultaneously attend to local institutional capacities, agroecosystem diversification and ecological management, and the quality of local diets. Two conceptual frameworks – social-ecological systems and sustainable diets – offer systems-based lenses for integrated analysis of agriculture and food security, which could inform the development of effective policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

In a previous article, we highlighted how biodiversity is vital for agricultural production, emphasizing the role of animal pollinators. Here, we discuss the different dimensions of food security and the key role of our food choices in the cities to drive land use in rural areas and minimize the environmental footprint. Although the environmental impact of agriculture and animal production are commonly justified for the need of greater production to achieve food security, the dimensions of food access and utilization are nowadays of critical importance. For example, worldwide, there are more people with nutritional problems associated with overweight than hunger. In addition, increasing agricultural production in some developed countries does not imply greater food availability in the poor regions where is needed. If the world population eat less meat of animals feed on grains (e.g. feedlots) the environmental impact will be lower, including lower greenhouse gas emission. It is key to identify the origin of the meat that we consume, given that there are other animal production systems with lower environmental impacts. Dietary change to reduce the excess of meat consumption in some sectors of the population can prevent many deaths because of lower obesity, and reduce the incidence of diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (the latter one is increasing all over the world at epidemic rates). The achievement of food security and sustainability relies on many pathways and includes changing the way in which we distribute and utilize the food, using the grains and beans to feed people instead of animals, reducing food waste, and changing our diets. © 2018, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

Unforeseen uncertainties during transitions are not faced strategically and interrupt collaboration among country teams expected to jointly implement policies, including policies intended to contribute to food and nutrition security. In some low- and middle-income countries, these obstacles result in persistent hunger, malnutrition, and death mainly affecting the most vulnerable populations and contributing to unequal human development. We aimed to understand what mechanisms determined sustainability of Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) during presidential transitions, from socio-political and nutritional perspectives, in a Central American country that experiences a change of president every four years. Purposeful criterion and snowball sampling were used to recruit 52 policy actors from all relevant sectors and levels, elected or appointed, that had contributed to implementing the FNSP adopted since 2006. Data from semi-structured interviews were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding. Results were verified using content analysis for obtaining emerging themes in news, speeches, and documents. Twenty-four forces simultaneously shaped a dynamic process determining sustainability during transitions. The forces for sustaining FNSP were Backed Up, Beneficial, Championed, Importance, Institutionally Sound, Owned, Sensitive, Shared, Steady Resources, Strategic, Transition Effect, and Trusted. The forces for not sustaining FNSP were Antagonistic Underlying Structure, Campaigning, Dysfunctional Transition, Fractioned, Haphazard, Insensitive, Irrelevant, Misrepresentation, Neglected, Rivalry, Unsound Institutions, and Unsteady Resources. These forces determining FNSP sustainability during transitions were molded by the emerging reasons for sustaining and for not sustaining policy actions as reported by the study participants. The forces favored or impeded the sustainability of an action or part of it. The forces operated at all levels and sectors, but forces affected actions differently in these. The forces did not compete, but combinations of them brought about outcomes that policy actors in charge and their collaborators could intentionally influence. The potential of forces to shape sustainability of FSNP depended on interacting actors responding to emerging events within specific contexts. Roles performed by civil society, governmental officials, and international cooperation were critical for policy sustainability during transitions. These results are consistent with Lewin's Force Field Theory on the complex dynamics embedded in intersecting forces within contexts and identify the specific forces that were operating. Although the 24 forces were identified in one context, the set of forces likely captures the range of forces that may operate in other similar political contexts. The knowledge that such forces may be operating could be helpful in ensuring sustainability of policies in the future. Actors and other stakeholders can identify the predominant specific forces operating for a policy and activate or promote the forces that enhance sustainability and deactivate or suppress the forces that inhibit sustainability. Foreseeing or creating opportunities to activate (or deactivate) and promote (or suppress) forces during the early stages of a presidential transition could help sustain policies and related practices that benefit food and nutrition security. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Yet little definitive evidence has been provided on the impact of biofuels on food security. The evidence base is particularly lacking in low-income countries where the establishment of a viable biofuel sector has been stifled by policy and market uncertainty, despite the potential for positive impacts in terms of poverty reduction and food security. In order to address social and environmental concerns surrounding biofuel production a number of voluntary sustainability certification schemes have been established, but few specifically address food security. This paper assesses how sustainability certification standards can help to ensure that biofuels deliver better food security outcomes.

Theoretical Implications: The design of the interdisciplinary course helped students think critically and creatively to learn complex issues. Advances in technology and active learning support a flipped classroom model to engage students. Place-based learning combined with interdisciplinary classroom experiences connected students to local real-world contexts and provided students with practical applications of problem-solving, critical thinking, and systems thinking skills. Originality/Value: Graduate students conducted an asset and needs assessment, which connected them to professionals in the community. Students think food and nutritional security, hunger, and sustainability are global challenges and seldom notice food insecurity in their local communities. © 2019, © 2019 Wageningen University."

In Ghana, effective management of fish and the fisheries is essential for food, economic and nutrition security and is critical towards achieving many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals especially those pertaining to hunger, poverty, gender equality and life under water. Ghana has experienced significant economic growth in the last few decades, but increasing inequality, uncertainties in fish availability and unsustainable management of the fisheries are challenging local food and nutrition security. This literature review examines and evaluates the role of fish and fisheries in supporting FNS in Ghana, and highlights the lack of focus on fish in the literature with regard to regional food security and fisheries governance. Our review highlights the importance of ensuring the viability of small fish populations to enhance micronutrient availability and counteract micronutrient deficiencies in Ghana. Additionally, strengthening women's role in decision making and promoting female education and empowerment in the fisheries sector is an important strategy towards enhancing FNS in the region. © 2020 The Authors"

Livestock provides extensive services and products which are critical in addressing the issues of hunger, malnutrition, health and diseases. However, despite such importance, livestock systems across the globe continue to face the challenge of sustainability. In this research article, using ethnographic research techniques, we examine the Beitbridge livestock systems to understand the vulnerabilities within the system and current efforts to overcome. The article identifies that the Beitbridge livestock system, similar to many others, faces numerous socio-ecological and political economy challenges. Also, in the past engagement of the author and the community, it emerged that there was limited use of digital technologies within the community. Therefore, this study explore whether digital technologies can contribute towards sustainability of livestock and if so, how. The major findings of the study are that, DTs have affordances which can be exploited to contribute towards the sustainability of the livestock system. However, in order for this to happen, there is need for convergence of conditions e.g. Presence of supporting institutions and improvement of digital infrastructure. These findings confirm the need for context based studies on DTs. The findings of the study provide practitioners and policy makers 'something to think about' in the development of DTs and supporting systems."

In the Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) member countries as a group, infant and child mortality were reduced by more than 65% between 1990 and 2015, achieving the MDG target of two-thirds reduction, although these goals were not achieved by several smaller countries. The SDGs are broader in focus than the MDGs, but include several goals that relate directly to nutrition: 2 (zero hunger—food), 3 (good health and well-being—healthy life), and 12 (responsible consumption and production—sustainability). Other SDGs that are closely related to nutrition are 4 and 5 (quality education and equality in gender—education and health for girls and mothers, which is very important for infant health) and 13 (climate action). Goal 3 is “good health and well-being,” which includes targets for child mortality, maternal mortality, and reducing chronic disease. The Global Burden of Disease Project has confirmed that the majority of risk for these targets can be attributed to nutrition-related targets. Dietary Guidelines were developed to address public health nutrition risk in the Asia Pacific region at the 48th APACPH 2016 conference and they are relevant to the achievement of the SDGs. Iron deficiency increases the risk of maternal death from haemorrhage, a cause of 300000 deaths world-wide each year. Improving diets and iron supplementation are important public health interventions in the APACPH region. Chronic disease and obesity rates in the APACPH region are now a major challenge and healthy life course nutrition is a major public health priority in answering this challenge. This article discusses the role of public health nutrition in achieving the SDGs. It also examines the role of APACPH in education and advocacy and in fulfilling the educational needs of public health students in public health nutrition. © 2017, © 2017 APJPH."

Land resources have become limited due to urbanization and industrialization. The existing agricultural land has been degraded and soil fertility has declined due to unsustainable farming practices. Despite of progress made in the past several decades, hunger and malnutrition in Africa still hinder health, human development and economic growth, which will become even worse in the future if proper measures are not taken. Sustainable intensification is the only solution to tackling both environmental sustainability including climate change and malnutrition, i.e., to produce more foods in terms of nutrients human body needs with less natural resources and carbon emissions. To achieve this vision, innovations in technologies, policies and institutions are essential.

The book begins with the recent development of agriculture under capitalism and neo-liberal regimes, and the transformation of farming and peasant agriculture from a small-scale, family-run way of life to a globalized system. Topics such as the global hunger and obesity challenges, GM foods, and international trade and subsidies are assessed as part of the world food economy. The final section concentrates on themes of sustainability, food security, and food sovereignty. The book concludes on a positive note, examining alternative agri-food movements aimed at changing foodscapes at levels from the local to the global. With increased coverage of the financialization of food, food and culture, gender, ethnicity and justice, food security, and food sovereignty, the book is perfect for students with little or no background in sociology and is also suitable for more advanced courses as a comprehensive primer.

The extent of anthropogenic CO2 release threatens our future and is not tolerable. The increase in atmospheric CO2 reflects the cumulative effect of human activities over more than a century and must be stopped. The contribution of photosynthesis to the binding of excess CO2 could be increased if other limitations such as limited N- and P-availability were overcome. The productivity of various types of vegetation increases upon application of fertilizers. However, N-fertilization jeopardizes natural biomes, alters the rhizosphere, decreases the biodiversity and stimulates the release of potent greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O. Therefore, fertilization must be restricted and fails as global solution to increase CO2 binding in biomass in context of climate action. Worldwide afforestation appears a powerful action. However, its capacity to reduce CO2 is sometimes overestimated. The consequences of afforestation on land use change, conservation of natural biomes, crop food prices and socio-economic traditions need to be considered. High priority must be given to the reduction of CO2 emission by combustion. In addition, there is urgent need to technically develop and economically implement negative emission technologies. Decisions in context of climate actions must be placed in the framework of all sustainable development goals including no poverty and no hunger. © 2021 Die Autoren. Biologie in unserer Zeit."

In addition, it calls for the establishment of new ways to reduce current food wastage, farming in a manner which conserves biodiversity and environmental services, increases enterprise profitability through new business models and empowers women. Finally, it seeks for governments to create coherent policies at all levels allowing these positive changes in farming systems to take place in every country. Moringa will play a key role in helping these desirable visions be attained. Moringa is a reasonably unique species as its fresh leaves and pods are both edible and extremely micronutrient dense. Its dried leaves are a good micronutrient source in food fortification for chronically underfed and malnourished children. It is a fast growing, productive tree that adapts well to a range of environments, especially in hot, semi-arid regions and is, thus, a climate-resilient crop. It grows well in a wide range of production systems from a densely planted green vegetable repetitively harvested crop, to a fullygrown tree crop which can be harvested periodically when needed. Use of this diversity of production systems in specialized environments can promote in-situ germplasm conservation, soil conservation, sustainable production systems, enhanced profitability and a continuous source of vitamins and minerals for smallholder farm families, and often - all of these attributes together. This species is thus a boon to women small-holders as it enables them to better provide their children with highly nutritious food direct from the family home garden or by procurement in the local market. Likewise, its good productivity and wide range of adaptability helps to develop resilience in farm enterprises and to ensure better enterprise profitability and sustainability."

A systematic analysis of power imbalances in food systems is required if we are to meet the 2030 Agenda vision of promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns and ending hunger and poverty. Such an analysis, with a view to a transformation to more sustainable and just food systems, requires tools to be developed and tested in real-life case studies of food systems. To better understand the structures and mechanisms around power in food systems, this study applies a political ecology lens. We adapted the ""power cube"" analysis framework that was proposed by the Institute of Development Studies for the analysis of spaces, forms, and levels of power. We apply the analysis of these three dimensions of power to two food systems in the tropical lowlands of Bolivia: one agroindustrial and one indigenous. After identifying food system actors, the food system spaces in which they interact, and what forms of power they use at what levels, we discuss some implications for an emerging scientific culture of power analyses in critical sustainability assessments. Mechanisms of hidden power undermine visible legislative power in both case studies, but in our example of an indigenous food system of the Guaraní people, visible power stays with a local community through their legally recognized and communally owned and governed territory, with important implications for the realization of the right to food. © 2018 by the authors."

Animal based protein production in particular is very resource consuming. To satisfy the growing meat hunger in the world, alternative protein sources are needed that both have a smaller environmental impact and are readily accepted by consumers. Compared to beef and pork, plant and insect proteins can be produced more sustainably, although consumer acceptance may pose a particular challenge for the latter. In this chapter, we will explore Western consumers’ acceptance of insects as food source and influencing factors. In particular, the role of emotional reactions towards insects, such as disgust and motivational barriers for the acceptance of insects as food will be discussed. Furthermore, the role of concepts taken from risk research, such as risk and benefit perception and trust, will be explored. Relevant characteristics of the insect product itself in terms of processing degree for consumers’ willingness to eat will be highlighted. To further increase the sustainability of the insect production, food waste could be used as insect feed instead of more resource intensive feeds.

World hunger has been declining for decades, and food production per capita has increased sharply since the 1960s. But this success has come with costs that raise questions about the sustainability and the unintended effects of the global “rationalization” of food production. Environmental costs include the degradation of groundwater, surface water, soils, and biologic diversity. Social costs include a growing rural-urban divide, a worldwide obesity epidemic, and antibiotic resistance. This paper takes an evolutionary perspective to look at global agriculture as an interlocking system of technologies, belief systems, and institutions that reinforces growth and technological complexity over stability and long-run sustainability.

The United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals place a high priority on food and energy security; bioenergy plays an important role in achieving both goals. Effective food security programs begin by clearly defining the problem and asking, ‘What can be done to assist people at high risk?’ Simplistic global analyses, headlines, and cartoons that blame biofuels for food insecurity may reflect good intentions but mislead the public and policymakers because they obscure the main drivers of local food insecurity and ignore opportunities for bioenergy to contribute to solutions. Applying sustainability guidelines to bioenergy will help achieve near- and long-term goals to eradicate hunger. Priorities for achieving successful synergies between bioenergy and food security include the following: (1) clarifying communications with clear and consistent terms, (2) recognizing that food and bioenergy need not compete for land and, instead, should be integrated to improve resource management, (3) investing in technology, rural extension, and innovations to build capacity and infrastructure, (4) promoting stable prices that incentivize local production, (5) adopting flex crops that can provide food along with other products and services to society, and (6) engaging stakeholders to identify and assess specific opportunities for biofuels to improve food security.

The application of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), Relative Trade Advantage (RTA), Lafay Competitive Advantage (LI), and Domestic Resource Costs (DRC) indexes to the array of 37 products results in the revealing of comparative, trade, competitive, and production advantages of five Central Asian economies for labor-intensive horticultural products and grains. Capital and technology-intensive sectors of animal husbandry and food processing are recognized as low competitive. Taking Central Asia-China collaboration as a model, the authors elaborate policy measures aimed at support, promotion, or establishment of competitive advantages. The application of the measures facilitates the concentration of the resources toward competitive and conditionally competitive products, allows to protect fragile advantages in marginally competitive sectors, and contributes to the overall improvement of stakeholders' performance across agricultural value chains in the region. © 2020 by the authors."

The criteria and approach we propose, for a paradigm shift towards sustainable intensification of agriculture, integrates the dual and interdependent goals of using sustainable practices to meet rising human needs while contributing to resilience and sustainability of landscapes, the biosphere, and the Earth system. Both of these, in turn, are required to sustain the future viability of agriculture.

The aim of this paper is to identify relationships between the undernourishment scale and selected characteristics describing the agricultural sector within identified clusters of developing countries. Typological groups of countries were separated usingWard's method. It results from the analyses that the greatest problems with maintaining food security are observed in the developing countries with a high share of agriculture in their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), adverse conditions hindering agricultural production and deficient infrastructure. Based on research results desirable and tailored strategies for food security improvement in individual clusters were developed. Promoting investments in agricultural infrastructure and extension services along with adopting measures aimed at increasing the households' purchasing power, especially those in rural areas, appear to be key drivers for improving both food availability and food access. The paper focuses not only on identifying the reasons of undernourishment, but also contributes to recognition of the most effective ways to solve the hunger problem under a country's unique conditions.

Brazil exemplifies such multifaceted scenario as the country has left the “hunger map” in 2014 but now faces another issue: The quality of the food available to its population. Physical, social, economic, cultural, and political factors have impacted the Brazilian food environment, shaping new eating habits such as the replacement of traditional local food for processed foods. Within this context, educational institutions may play an important role in spreading knowledge about major social challenges such as this and their interdependent causes.

In addition, an assessment of land development phases (LDPs) in a human-dominated landscape coupled with an analysis of the water-food-ecosystem (WFE) nexus can deepen our understanding of sustainable land management. In this study, we proposed the concept of land development phases (LDPs) by forest and GDP changes using previously-applied theoretical and empirical approaches. The positive relationship between GDP growth and forest stock changes was used to analyze the timing of forest stock changes as five-year averages, which were aggregated over 20 years to classify LDPs. In addition, forest area changes compared with GDP and GDP per capita changes were analyzed to identify LDPs. Based on two conceptual approaches, we suggested global land into three LDPs: degradation, restoration and sustainability. Using this approach, most of Europe, North America and northeast Asia were classified as sustainability phases, while Africa and Central Asia in the Mid-Latitude region appeared to have degradation or restoration phases. The LDPs described could be improved with further incorporation of solid data analysis and clear standards, but even at this stage, these LDP classifications suggest points for implementing appropriate land management. In addition, indices from comparative analysis of the LDPs with the WFE nexus can be connected with socio-economic global indices, such as the Global Hunger Index, the Food Production Index and the Climate Change Performance Index.

The right to food is a fundamental right of humans. With increasing population and urbanization, less land is being used for agricultural purposes. In addition, the climate change due to global warming often leads to frequent disasters such as droughts and floods, adversely affecting the food production. This leads to increased levels of poverty and hunger. Ensuring food security has become the prime agenda for all the policymakers and government bodies across the world. With changing global dynamics, traditional ways of ensuring food security will not be sufficient alone. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need to develop a sustainable food security system that not only focusses on food production but also equally emphasizes on the efficacy of food distribution and reducing food wastage. In this digital age, the emerging disruptive technologies like Block chain, robotics, big data analytics, and cloud computations, etc., are increasingly changing the functioning of various sectors, giving rise to IoT-based working environment. The policymakers are also exploring these technologies to maximize their outreach so as to benefit the larger set of population and to gain visualization and control over policy implementation using IoT. This paper attempts to model the sustainable food security system using various technologies driving IoT. It also studies the interrelationship among various technologies and their application in various levels of policy implementation. The methodology used in the paper is fuzzy-TISM, which not only provides the causal relationship among two technologies but also provides the magnitude of the cause–effect relationship and the hierarchical framework for the complex problem. Findings: The paper is addressed to the design of sustainable food security system in the Indian context wherein government ensures food security for all, using public distribution system (PDS). Social implications: The paper is addressed to the design of sustainable food security system in Indian context wherein government ensures food security for all, using PDS. Originality/value: This study is a novel attempt to integrate the IoT into the design of the PDS to ensure food security. The enabling factors for IOT are modelled using Fuzzy-TISM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The accomplishment of these goals requires individuals who can think critically about our current food systems. Since 2013, professors at Allegheny College have taught a food and agriculture course entitled Soil to Plate to address questions related to agriculture and food security. The 15-week course covers sustainable farming practices, soil fertility, pest management, and the factors that influence access to high quality food. Methods of introducing content are multi-modal: Field trips, lectures, discussions, guest speakers, cooking lessons, and skype sessions with experts around the world. Weekly field trips are taken to small, medium, and large-scale farms, food processing facilities, food pantries, community gardens, and grocery markets.

As human population rises, overfishing, water stress related mainly to agriculture, livestock and industry, together with marine pollution and global warming are dangerously reducing marine biodiversity and natural resources. In this challenging landscape, ensuring food security by finding a sustainable and high-quality food source has become a priority. In this sense, fish should be considered as a preferred food, being an important source of digestible proteins, beneficial fatty acids and vitamins, with a low content of saturated fats. However, overfishing of wild populations, together with marine pollution, have been linked to a significant biodiversity loss and have contributed to a downward trajectory in wild caught fishing. Within this framework, a great opportunity arises for an efficient productive sector: aquaculture. Aquaculture provides a great opportunity to fight global hunger, as it is the food sector and one of the productive sectors experiencing the fastest growth, which currently supplies more than half of the fish consumed worldwide. Aquaculture is considered a sustainable alternative, since it allows the efficient use of natural resources, guaranteeing food hygiene, security and promoting economic growth, with a minimal environmental impact. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The authors expect that hungry consumers display a lower preference for sustainable food items and that this hunger-induced imprint on food consumption patterns must be traced back to the fact that the activation of very fundamental human needs contaminates stereotypical perceptions of sustainable products. More importantly, hunger primarily operates spontaneously, as well as automatically, and affects perceptions, which are difficult to control (and which sometimes go unnoticed). A laboratory experiment studied this premise by sampling 166 participants with 18 h of actual food deprivation, half of them having breakfast before and the other half after completing the experimental tasks. The participants who had breakfast show a stronger tendency to choose sustainable products, which can be traced back to implicit gentleness-associations concerning sustainable products in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Albeit explicitly held beliefs also influence choices, these judgments are not affected by food deprivation. A field study then replicates the findings in a real-life setting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The global population is about 6.8 billion, and it is projected that by 2025, it will reach about 8 billion. Most of the bulk of the additional population is expecting to come from the developing world, which will see its population increase by 61 percent by 2050. World population is growing at an exponential rate and people, be they in urban or rural areas, depend on food for everyday sustenance (UN-ESA, 2009). Population densities of Cameroon stand at 62.6, which are relatively high and are on the increase (World Bank, 2013). Food availability is an important factor affecting human population growth, along with other density dependent limiting factors (Hopfenberg, 2003). The increasing population will therefore have a significant role in influencing and shaping the nature of change and future of land use and food security. ‘Hunger has always been an invitation to make a better world, and it remains so’ (Roberts, 2008). Throughout the history of human existence, food has held centre stage in the construction of human societies and the evolution of human activity. Food is vital to our understanding of who we are as nations and communities, and the healthy production of food beyond subsistence levels (Budge and Slade, 2009) is a call for attention. This opens up avenues for deeper assessments on linking exponential growth rates in population and food security needs, which may lead to even more transformations of landscapes, land use, land cover, development or shocks within societies. By this, greater concerns over issues of population, land use change, urbanization, climate change, and food security will remain top on the international agenda on global challenges (FAO, 2005). Population growth influences land use patterns in combination with consump- tion behaviours and productive activities of the world’s people (Wolman, 1993). Current population growth is being accompanied by a change in human habitat. Population growth, migration, family formation, and household fission lead to greater population density and land fragmentation. This growth and density leads to increased consumption of natural resources through the expansion of grazing and fodder, as well as in increased agricultural production (intensification and extensification on marginal lands) (Mortimore et al., 1994). Understanding trends in population size and change are crucial to estimating the future demand for food (Godfray et al., 2010). Examining and understanding the systemic of present and future human population distribution is critical to understanding the impacts that population growth could have on the rest of the human-environment system in the future. The introduction of satellite image systems presses a new paradigm shift to the forefront of spatial demographic analysis. Satellite data can now be used along with more traditional demographic techniques, providing an even better tool for evaluating population dynamics. It has become one of the strongest tools for analysing and interpreting the complex systems of the earth and the anthropogenic influences that continue to pressure the planet’s limited resources. This of course must be taken in the context of inherent data errors and all other problems and assumptions associated with extrapolation from one scale to another (Muhlestein, 2008). This chapter thus questions how population dynamics affects the sustainability of agricultural land use and also the vulnerability of land users’ in being food secure. It seeks to establish a link between land use land cover change and population change dynamics in determining food security. © 2016 Rob Roggema, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors."

In particular, the construct measures of the structural model have been tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings: The outcome the authors came up with is coherent with the hypothesized model, and it proves a positive relationship of the five dimensions identified on consumer awareness. Moreover, the study results show the crucial role of landfill and water shortage concerns in measuring consumer awareness.

Sustainable agricultural practices that are referred to by the label “agroecology” have been promoted as one of the solutions to the challenges, which have a potential to contribute to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals of ending hunger and achieving food and nutrition security. However, there is disagreement regarding the question of whether agroecology can indeed provide a real solution to these challenges. Some argue that sustainable agricultural intensification practices, which rely on high external input use, are critical to increasing agricultural productivity and are preferable to a focus on agroecological intensification practices, which rely on use of biological processes within the farm.

The results identify 5 world regions and indicate the existence of an agrifood debt (i.e., disequilibria between regions in the natural resources consumed, the environmental impacts produced, and the social wellbeing attained by populations that play different roles within the globalized agrifood system). Three spotlights underpin this debt: 1) a severe contrast in diets and food security between regions, 2) a concern about the role that international agrifood trade is playing in regional food security, and 3) a mismatch between regional biocapacity and food security.

The analysis revealed eight aspirational food system discourses: production, distribution, and infrastructure; healthy, organic, local food; behavioral health and education; sustainability; finance and investment; hunger relief; demand-side preferences; romanticized, community led transformations. Study findings reveal that of eight discourses, only three encompass the experiences of low-wealth rural residents. This aspirational food system may aggravate the lack of autonomy and powerlessness already experienced by low-wealth rural groups, perpetuate a sense of failure by groups who will be unable to reach the aspirational food vision, silence discourses that might question those that play a role in the inequitable distribution of income while sanctioning discourses that focus on personal or community solutions, and leave out other policy-based solutions that address issues located within the food system. Further research might explore how to draw attention to silenced discourses on the needs and preferences of low-wealth rural populations to ensure that the policies and programs promoted by food system experts mitigate poor diets caused by food insecurity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate an ongoing statewide weekend backpack program through the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Design. Mixed-methods inquiry was used to explore the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of backpack programs within Montana. Setting. Study participants completed audio-recorded one-on-one phone interviews. Participants. Key informants (e.g., managers at food banks, staff at participating schools, policy makers) were purposively sampled (N = 20). Method. Semistructured interviews were conducted to gather data to describe each RE-AIM dimension. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and deductively (i.e., using RE-AIM as themes) coded for meaning units, placed into higher-order categories, and summarized in narrative. Supporting quantitative data (e.g., the proportion of eligible students that joined the program, rate of school-level adoption) were calculated using descriptive statistics. Results. Backpack programs with a broad reach and evidenced effect may be appealing to adopt. Weekend food bags cost an average $3.87 (SD ±.94) and there were some positive (i.e., ease, protecting participants' privacy) and very few negative (logistical) components of implementation. Collaborators and community partners are necessary for long-term sustainability. Conclusion.

This paper argues that it can. We assess climate and gender bias impacts on women’s production in the global South and North and challenge the male model of agricultural development to argue further that women’s farming approaches can be more sustainable. Level-based analysis (global, regional, local) draws on a literature review, including the authors’ published longitudinal field research in Ghana and the United States. Women farmers are shown to be undervalued and to work harder, with fewer resources, for less compensation; gender bias challenges are shared globally while economic disparities differentiate; breaches of distributive, gender, and intergenerational justices as well as compromise of food sovereignty affect women everywhere. We conclude that investing in women’s agriculture needs more than standard approaches of capital and technology investment. Effective ‘investment’ would include systemic interventions into agricultural policy, governance, education, and industry; be directed at men as well as women; and use gender metrics, for example, quotas, budgets, vulnerability and impacts assessments, to generate assessment reports and track gender parity in agriculture.

Area of study: Members of university communities from agri-food field departments at universities from three Ibero-American countries (Spain, Colombia and Brazil). Material and methods: 631 on line surveys from different Ibero-American faculties of the area. Descriptive, quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. The level of knowledge and engagement of SDGs related to agriculture sector as Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) were investigated. Main results: The level of knowledge about the SDG Agenda, the priority rating for the implementation of each goal and the level of engagement varied significantly between countries. While Spain obtained the highest values in most of the variables relating to knowledge of the SDGs, followed by Brazil, Colombia showed the highest levels of engagement and willingness to apply specific actions in the agri-food sector to promote the implementation of the SDGs. Research highlights: The knowledge and engagement must be improved if we are to achieve the SDGs, and education and research play a vital role in bridging the SDG implementation gap in agri-food field. In the area the best-known SDG strategies are those related to sustainable farming systems and the least-known are the concept of 'degrowth' as a possible efficient strategy, 'permaculture' and 'local production and consumption'.

The chapter argues that there are important contextual differences that need to be considered by African urban planners in order to address food insecurity.

The answer to this question will necessarily involve diversification of - and innovation within - the protein sources and manufacturing practices utilized to produce high-quality protein foods.

Methodology/approach: Food system channels are defined, discussed in relationship to other food system components, considered in terms of historical food system changes, examined in relationship to wellbeing and disease, and proposed to have useful applications. Findings: Food system channels are broad, organized, and integrated pathways through which foods and nutrients pass. Channels are larger in scale and scope than previously described food system structures like chains, stages, sectors, networks, and others. Four major types of contemporary Western food system channels differ in their underlying values and health impacts. (1) Industrialized food channels are based on profit as an economic value, which contributes to a diversity of inexpensive foods and chronic diseases. (2) Emergency food channels are based on altruism as a moral value, and try to overcome gaps in industrialized channels to prevent diseases of poverty. (3) Alternative food channels are based on justice and environmen-talism as ethical values, and seek to promote wellness and sustainability. (4) Subsistence food channels are based on self-sufficiency as a traditional value, and seek self-reliance to avoid hunger and illness. Historical socioeconomic development of agricultural and industrial transitions led to shifts in illness food system channels that shaped dietary, nutritional, epidemiological, and mortality transitions.

Food appropriate for human consumption but ultimately ends up unconsumed or discarded is called food waste. Reducing food waste can bring down the food costs, benefit the environment, and improve food security and human health as food comprised of various nutrients which are vital for disease prevention. Food and nutrition waste estimation is essential to provide awareness among the general public regarding importance of food which is thrown away as waste and to develop policies on regional and global level to reduce food waste or redirect surplus food to needy people before it going to waste. The current study aimed to (i) determine the level of food waste and its composition by types (ii) calculate the nutritional losses from food wastes and (iii) examine the causes of food waste at household level in tehsil Kahror Pakka, Pakistan. To explore these objectives, food waste generated during 24 h was collected from fifty one households, sorted and weighed into different types such as fruit, vegetables, cooked food, processed food, meat including fish and poultry and dairy products. Maximum food waste was associated with cooked food (35.02 g) whereas, minimum waste was reported by dairy products (1.98 g) per capita per day. Nutritional value of food waste was estimated by comparing the values of each food item with food composition table for Pakistan. Total amount of household food waste represented an estimated value of energy (54.42 kcal), protein (2.61 g), lipids (2.21 g), carbohydrates (10.58 g), fiber (0.75 g), β-carotene (275.2 mcg), and vitamin A (96.83RE), calcium (Ca) (22.49 mg) and phosphorous (P) (37.11 mg) per capita per day.

Nonetheless, subsistence hunting occupies an uncertain legal status in Brazil, leaving many traditional and rural Amazonian populations subject to arbitrary interpretation and enforcement of contradictory laws. The Brazilian Wildlife Protection Act of 1967, which helped to stem the slaughter of wild animals for the international hide market, made the hunting of all wild animals illegal. Later, only indigenous peoples had their rights to hunting explicitly recognized in Brazilian laws. Exceptions for other traditional and rural populations were then introduced, allowing subsistence hunters to own and license guns and hunt with them in a “state of necessity” or “to quench hunger” through the Brazilian Disarmament Statute and Environmental Crimes Law. These legal inconsistences mean that there is no single regulatory framework for subsistence hunting in Brazil. This scenario of uncertainties jeopardizes the establishment of consistent sustainable hunting management practices across Brazilian indigenous lands, sustainable use reserves and agrarian reform settlement areas. This article analyzes the relevant legislation and examines evidence from key studies with a view towards implementing robust, scientifically informed and practically feasible co-management strategies for indigenous and sustainable use reserves in the Brazilian Amazon. By focusing on subsistence rights, food sovereignty and organizational autonomy as guaranteed in international agreements ratified in Brazil, the framework presented here involves empowerment and technical training of local people in Amazonia to monitor and manage their own resource base. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Considering the importance of food supply chains, the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of sustainable food supply chain management and to propose an integrated framework. With this objective, the chapter provides an overview of sustainable development and the importance of food supply chain management to address the global food crisis.

This is particularly true in countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, where hunger and undernutrition persist and natural resource are increasingly strained. Sustainable intensification with a focus on nutrition is particularly crucial to provide adequate and nutritious food for all without further damages to the planet. However, a silo approach to meeting the demands of a growing, increasingly urbanised, and wealthier population is no longer acceptable.

The 20th century saw world population increase from 1.6 to 6.1 billion, accompanied and to some extent made possible by rapid improvements in health standards and food supply, with associated advances in agricultural and nutrition sciences. In this paper, I use the application of linear programming (LP) in preparation of rations for farm animals to illustrate a method of calculating the lowest cost of a human diet selected from locally available food items, constrained to provide recommended levels of food energy and nutrients; then, to find a realistic minimum cost, I apply the further constraint that the main sources of food energy in the costed diet are weighted in proportion to the actual reported consumption of food items in that area. Worldwide variations in dietary preferences raise the issue as to the sustainability of popular dietary regimes, and the paper reviews the factors associated with satisfying requirements for adequate nutrition within those regimes. The ultimate physical constraints on food supply are described, together with the ways in which climate change may affect those constraints. During the 20th century, food supply increased sufficiently in most areas to keep pace with the rapid increase in world population. Many challenges will need to be overcome if food supply is to continue to meet demand, and those challenges are made more severe by rising expectations of quality of life in the developing world, as well as by the impacts of climate change on agriculture and aquaculture. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The Breeding and management practices of indigenous bovine breeds: Solutions towards a sustainable future (BOVISOL) project is a scientific cooperation between three Mediterranean countries (Greece, Tunisia and Algeria) supported and funded by the European Commission under the European Research Area Networks (ERA-NET) scheme of the 7th Framework Programme. This project has been formed around the hypothesis that the local bovine breeds must be preserved since they possess a valuable genetic pool, and they are a part of the landscape and the biodiversity of rural areas. Moreover, their products (milk, cheese, meat, etc.) could contribute significantly to the local economies as they could easily be associated with recent food trends like “local” and “slow food”, which are considered today, as, not only a mean of nutrition, but also a way of living and a part of people’s identity. BOVISOL project aims to: (i) identify the local breeds and populations in a national level, (ii) describe the existing farm and breeding practices, (iii) analyze the quality of the main local animal products, (iv) propose solutions that will promote the sustainability of the traditional farming systems, especially nowadays that climate change proposes new challenges on animal production, and (v) disseminate the solutions on all the levels of the sector (farmers, scientists, local communities, governmental agencies). © 2020 by the authors.

Difference-in-difference and propensity score matching estimations are used to determine the impact of program participation on the household Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). We found that program participation reduced the MPI significantly, which is mainly driven by the food insecurity dimension, and that the reduction in poverty is due to the reduction in the incidence and intensity, the latter in particular, of poverty among the ultra-poor households. Our analysis of the political economy of Kenya suggests that, while the government is making progress in the institutionalization of social protection, weaknesses in the implementation and financing of the program, as well as the short-term focus of impact evaluation, may undermine the program’s potential to help build a strong state that is accountable for the eradication of poverty. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies - including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes - into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change. Importantly, we find that these targeted policies can more than compensate for most sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2 °C to 1.5 °C. © 2018 The Author(s).

This is more than eradicating hunger but considers availability of support and health services and the availability of appropriate foods to meet individual requirements. In particular, this paper considers those in rural communities, from lower socioeconomic groups or underlying health conditions. Methods Semistructured professional conversations informed the development of a questionnaire which gathered insights from five organisations involved with the emergency food response in the South East, England, UK. Descriptive themes were derived though inductive analysis and are further discussed in relation to UK government food support measures and early published data. Results Four themes emerged from conversations, including: (1) increasing demand, (2) meeting the needs of specific groups, (3) awareness of food supply and value of supporting local and (4) concerns over sustainability. All organisations mentioned changes in practice and increased demand for emergency food solutions. Positive, rapid and innovative changes helped organisations to adapt to containment restrictions and to meet the needs of vulnerable people. Although concern was raised with regards to meeting the specific needs of those with underlying health conditions and the sustainability of current efforts. Conclusion Considerable gaps in food provision were identified, as well as concerns regarding increased long-term food and nutrition insecurity. The paper makes recommendations to improve nutrition security for the future and considers the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Irrigation, therefore, has a crucial role in enhancing food security and reducing hunger in the region. Numerous countries in Africa consider water and irrigation management as a key factor in improving their food security and ensuring access to drinking-water for their populations. Fortunately, there is evidence from a number of places on the continent where the adoption of efficient irrigation systems has led to higher productivity among smallholder farmers. While the appropriate interventions for the diverse agro-ecological zones of sub-Saharan Africa are known, adoption among smallholder farmers still remains a challenge. Digital technology opens the vast untapped potential for farmers, investors, and entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of food production and consumption in Africa. From precision farming to an efficient food supply chain, technology could bring major economic, social, and environmental benefits. Increasing investment and involvement of the private sector is crucial for the up-scaling of irrigation technologies. Indeed, the sheer optimism across the startup ecosystem is that extreme hunger can be cured in Africa, in this generation, by significantly transforming the industry that employs most of its citizens. This paper draws on lessons from past trends in the irrigation industry and emphasizes on novel directions to ensure that farmers, as well as other stakeholders reap the benefits associated with improved technologies. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Specifically, it examines shocks imposed by the implementation of austerity policy and neoliberal welfare reform and the longer term individualisation that gives rise to greater vulnerability to such shocks and how community organisations encourage different levels of resilience in the face of this. Original findings from case study and qualitative analysis are twofold. Firstly, food insecurity effects are not only hunger and poor health experienced at the individual scale, but they also extend into places through the loss of social networks, erosion of community spaces, denigration of local foodscapes and collective de-skilling that limits the community resources needed for self-organising. Secondly, the ways in which food support is provided in communities has implications for how communities can regain the resources they need to be able to enact resilience in the face of trouble and difficulty. As such, the research demonstrates that self-organising is more than free-time activity; in these conditions, the capacity to self-organise is a vital community asset that is necessary for building resilience and social sustainability. As such, policy responses to poverty should take a multi-scale approach. © 2019 by the authors."

Often, in many countries, the adoption of laws and international commitments regarding climate change do not generate short-term actions capable of anticipating already existing and future situations and threats. The so-called â€œDry Corridorsâ€ in Guatemala is an example of this weakness. From this situation emerges a series of challenges regarding sustainable development, environment and climate change threats that require an effective coordination between the main stakeholders in order to make a significant change. Multiple challenges should convert into priorities to make a difference with regard to these issues. This study is oriented to point out three (3) of them which are crucial. This will enable decision-makers, with this guidance, to provide the foundations for the short, mid and long-term. Firstly, there is a need to have an efficient strategy formulated, implemented and evaluated for the eradication of poverty and hunger. These populations are the ones that suffer more sustainable development shortcomings, environmental and climate change impacts. Usually, these events translate into food insecurity and low nutrition levels. Secondly, it is necessary to avoid factors that prevent effective coordination between the private sector, civil society, government and academic sectors, which together constitute the pillars of the â€œQuadruple Helixâ€ alliance network. They are usually main protagonists of these impacts, especially at the local level. Finally, there is an urgency of approving a decentralized effort involving these actors mainly at local levels. The separation of regulations, the generation of specific benefits for the target populations and the payment of these goods and services are part of a participation culture that engages all stakeholders. This last alternative gives rise to 19 modalities with different alliances and behaviors of the aforementioned sectors to face detected weaknesses. Â© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate US consumers’ perceptions of imperfect “ugly” produce and their willingness to purchase and consume these foods in their households. Design/methodology/approach: Four focus group sessions with at least five voluntary participants per session were conducted. Each session used structured interview questions and the discussions were led by the same moderator. All sessions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed based on published focus group guidelines and recommendations. Findings: The research study has revealed two categories of potential consumers, Influencers and Learners, when it comes to an initial understanding of “ugly” produce consumption. The study also identified nine themes (i.e. food safety, price sensitivity, location of sale, product display, name/label, purpose of use, fun, targeted education and food waste) that consumers hold regarding imperfect “ugly” produce. Research limitations/implications: Insights from this study provide strategies for sustainable food management that could help stakeholders along all points of the food chain save money, reduce hunger and diminish food waste in our communities. Originality/value: This study serves to provide preliminary insights in approaching the issue of consumers’ perception of imperfect “ugly” fruits and vegetables from a research perspective.

It reflects on the debate about whether transgenic foods should be used, which is more of a social controversy than a scientific one.

Given that economic growth does not directly equate to human development, this paper states that it is necessary to address the problem of poverty and hunger from the capacity development framework according to human rights. Poverty causes disability by limiting human development; it creates the conditions for the violation of human rights; therefore, an institutional framework and social initiatives aimed at protecting the poor should be established. Finally, the main lines of research in the field of biotechnology are outlined, such as the development of genetically modified organisms and the need to continue defining methods, based on the development of capabilities.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze some of the links between the two notions of sustainable diet and sustainable food system in order to facilitate their implementation. The notion of sustainable diet was defined in 2010, combining two very different perspectives: nutrition, focused on individuals, and global sustainability, in all its dimensions, environmental, economic and social. The nutrition perspective can be easily linked to the objective of health improvement. The sustainability perspective requires more complex analyses. We propose to consider it as the contribution of a diet to the sustainability of a food system. Such an approach, covering the three dimensions of sustainable development, enables to identify interactions and interrelations between food systems and diets. It gives the possibility to find levers of change towards sustainability. Diets are at the same time the result of the way food systems function and drivers of systemic changes. Drivers of change for each category of actors inside food systems, consumers, private sector… are different and can be triggered by different concerns (health, environment, social and cultural aspects). Integrating these different dimensions and motivations can encourage transition towards sustainable diets, depending on the specificities of each food system. Adoption of sustainable diets can be facilitated and activated by the very structure of food systems, as well as by appropriate policies and incentives. © 2016"

It is motivated by the ongoing covid-19 global epidemic, but expands to a broader view on the crises that disrupt food systems and threaten food security, locally to globally. Beyond the public health crisis it is causing, the current global pandemic is impacting food systems, locally and globally. Crises such as the present one can, and do, affect the stability of food production. One of the worst fears is the impacts that crises could have on the potential to produce food, that is, on the primary production of food itself, for example, if material and non-material infrastructure on which agriculture depends were to be damaged, weakened, or fall in disarray. Looking beyond the present, and not minimising its importance, the covid-19 crisis may turn out to be the trigger for overdue fundamental transformations of agriculture and the global food system. This is because the global food system does not work well today: the number of hungry people in the world has increased substantially, with the World Food Programme warning of the possibility of a “hunger pandemic”. Food also must be nutritious, yet unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death. Deepening crises impoverish the poorest, disrupt food systems, and expand “food deserts”. A focus on healthy diets for all is all the more relevant when everyone’s immune system must react to infection during a global pandemic. There is also accumulating and compelling evidence that the global food system is pushing the Earth system beyond the boundaries of sustainability. In the past twenty years, the growing demand for food has increasingly been met through the destruction of Earth’s natural environment, and much less through progress in agricultural productivity generated by scientific research, as was the case during the two previous decades. There is an urgent need to reduce the environmental footprint of the global food system: if its performances are not improved rapidly, the food system could itself be one main cause for food crises in the near future.

A number of agricultural and ecological scientists believe that a large-scale shift to organic farming (OF) would not only increase the world's food supply, but might be the only way to eradicate hunger sustainably. Nevertheless, OF has recently come under new scrutiny, not just from critics who fear that a large-scale shift in this direction would cause billions to starve but also from farmers and development agencies who question whether such a shift could improve food security. Meanwhile, the use of genetically modified (GM) crops is growing around the world, leading to possible opportunities to combat food insecurity and hunger. However, the development of GM crops has been a matter of considerable interest and worldwide public controversy. So far, no one has comprehensively analyzed whether a widespread shift to OF or GM would be the sole solution for both food security and safety. Using a literature review from databases of peer-reviewed scientific publications, books, and official publications, this study aims to address this issue. Results indicate that OF and GM, to different extents, are able to ensure food security and safety. In developed countries, given that there are relatively few farmers and that their productivity, even without GMOs, is relatively high, OF could be more a viable option. However, OF is significantly less efficient in land-use terms and may lead to more land being used for agriculture due to its lower yield. In developing countries, where many small-scale farmers have low agricultural productivity and limited access to agricultural technologies and information, an approach with both GM and OF might be a more realistic approach to ensure food security and safety. © 2017 by the authors."

Individuals involved in a nonviolent demonstration use the immediacy of their needs and the sustainability of collective action to decide whether or not to initiate violence against the state. Specifically, I hypothesize that the likelihood of violent escalation will increase when the food price increases and unemployment rate is high or when the event is spontaneous.

Intervention strategies targeting food security triggered a long lasting debate whether science and technology driven interventions could be the panacea for hunger eradication. However, contextual factors are extremely important in determining food security, as it is a location specific outcome of how biophysical, geographical, societal and political factors combine. Recent studies emphasize the important role of institutions to understand the persistence of food insecurity or to explain how different actors address food security. This article introduces a special issue that investigates approaches and methods, anchored in different institutionalisms, diagnosing how institutions influence food security levels in diverse African contexts. We draw two main lessons from this special issue. Firstly, there is a clear need for localized ex-ante institutional diagnostics to understand developments in food security in Africa. This can inform and guide decision-makers in designing locally appropriate interventions. Secondly, developing institutional diagnostics in view of sustainable food security requires theoretical triangulation; food insecurity is typically a problem emerging from a configuration of distinct processes. To develop a contextual and precise understanding of how institutions work and to identify what an institutional context ‘is good at’ the special issue argues in favour of an interdisciplinary approach in the social sciences that is strongly rooted in evolving practices (re)arranging institutions affecting food security. © 2017 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences"

Rethinking Food and Agriculture explores and uncovers some of the key historical, ethical, economic, social, cultural, political, and structural drivers and root causes of unsustainability, degradation of the agricultural environment, destruction of nature, short-comings in science and knowledge systems, inequality, hunger and food insecurity, and disharmony. It reviews efforts towards ‘sustainable development’, and reassesses whether these efforts have been implemented with adequate responsibility, acceptable societal and environmental costs and optimal engagement to secure sustainability, equity and justice. The book highlights the many ways that farmers and their communities, civil society groups, social movements, development experts, scientists and others have been raising awareness of these issues, implementing solutions and forging ŉew ways forward’, for example towards paradigms of agriculture, natural resource management and human nutrition which are more sustainable and just. Rethinking Food and Agriculture proposes ways to move beyond the current limited view of agro-ecological sustainability towards overall sustainability of the food and agriculture system based on the principle of ‘inclusive responsibility’. Inclusive responsibility encourages ecosystem sustainability based on agro-ecological and planetary limits to sustainable resource use for production and livelihoods. Inclusive responsibility also places importance on quality of life, pluralism, equity and justice for all and emphasises the health, well-being, sovereignty, dignity and rights of producers, consumers and other stakeholders, as well as of nonhuman animals and the natural world. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

While recognizing the moral imperative to feed hungry people, this book challenges the effectiveness, sustainability and moral legitimacy of globally entrenched corporate food banking as the primary response to rich world food poverty. It investigates the prevalence and causes of domestic hunger and food waste in OECD member states, the origins and thirty-year rise of US style charitable food banking, and its institutionalization and corporatization. It unmasks the hidden functions of transnational corporate food banking which construct domestic hunger as a matter for charity thereby allowing indifferent and austerity-minded governments to ignore increasing poverty and food insecurity and their moral, legal and political obligations, under international law, to realize the right to food. The book’s unifying theme is understanding the food bank nation as a powerful metaphor for the deep hole at the centre of neoliberalism, illustrating: the de-politicization of hunger; the abandonment of social rights; the stigma of begging and loss of human dignity; broken social safety nets; the dysfunctional food system; the shift from income security to charitable food relief; and public policy neglect. It exposes the hazards of corporate food philanthropy and the moral vacuum within negligent governments and their lack of public accountability. The advocacy of civil society with a right to food bite is urgently needed to gather political will and advance ‘joined-up’ policies and courses of action to ensure food security for all. © 2018 Graham Riches."

This means that to continue to feed the world, we will need to optimize the production and utilization of food around the globe. Optimization of a process on a global scale requires massive data. Agriculture is no exception, but also brings its own unique issues, based on how wide spread agricultural data are, and the wide variety of data that is relevant to optimization of food production and supply. This suggests that we need a global data ecosystem for agriculture and nutrition. Such an ecosystem already exists to some extent, made up of data sets, metadata sets and even search engines that help to locate and utilize data sets. A key concept behind this is sustainability—how do we sustain our data sets, so that we can sustain our production and distribution of food? In order to make this vision a reality, we need to navigate the challenges for sustainable data management on a global scale. Starting from the current state of practice, how do we move forward to a practice in which we make use of global data to have an impact on world hunger? In particular, how do we find, collect and manage the data? How can this be effectively deployed to improve practice in the field? And how can we make sure that these practices are leading to the global goals of improving production, distribution and sustainability of the global food supply?

These issues are expected to adversely affect the agricultural ecosystem and well-being of the society. In order to minimize food insecurity and prevent hunger, a timely adaptation is desirable to reduce potential losses and to seek alternatives for promoting a global knowledge system for agricultural sustainability. This paper examines the causal relationship between agricultural ecosystem and CO2 emissions as an environmental pollution indicator in Pakistan from the period 1972 to 2014 by employing Johansen cointegration, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, and Granger causality approach. The Johansen cointegration results show that there is a significant long-run relationship between the agricultural ecosystem and the CO2 emissions. The long-run relationship shows that a 1% increase in biomass burned crop residues, emissions of CO2 equivalent of nitrous oxide (N2O) from synthetic fertilizers, stock of livestock, agricultural machinery, cereal production, and other crop productions will increase CO2 emissions by 1.29, 0.05, 0.45, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.65%, respectively. Further, our finding detects that there is a bidirectional causality of CO2 emissions with rice area paddy harvested, cereal production, and other crop productions. The impulse response function analysis displays that biomass-burned crop residues, stock of livestock, agriculture machinery, cereal production, and other crop productions are significantly contributing to CO2 emissions in Pakistan. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study contributes knowledge about the impact of food-based approaches on the diets of populations at risk of hunger and food insecurity in four of the poorest rural communities in South Africa. The study investigated the consumption and production patterns of rural households (278 in summer and 280 in winter) in four sites in the poorest municipalities in South Africa. Methods: A multistage stratified random sampling technique was applied to identify the communities and sample households for the quantitative survey and qualitative assessments. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected between 2013 and 2015 through focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews and the two-round panel survey to cover both the summer and winter seasons at each site. Results: Home gardening led to a significant positive increase in the consumption of white roots and tubers, dark green leafy vegetables, orange-coloured fruit and other fruit in the 24 h prior to the survey. Participation in a community garden led to significant increases in the consumption of dark green leafy vegetables and other vegetables. School gardening did not demonstrate any statistical relationships with the consumption of foods from the crop-related food groups. Crop production improved dietary diversity. Selling produce and irrigation showed a stronger improvement in dietary diversity. Seasonality affected the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables for home consumption in winter. Conclusions: Producing beyond that solely for home consumption has greater benefits for dietary diversity and a consumption-smoothing effect during the post-harvest period. Politicians and the scientific community should recognise the role that household and small-scale crop production plays in supporting household consumption and the provision of essential micronutrients despite constraints and disincentives. Production and education programmes should focus on strengthening existing good consumption patterns and promoting the consumption of foods that can improve dietary diversity.  © 2020 The Author(s)."

Recently, scientists recognized that human wellness and healthy life are going to face challenges in the near future because of the vulnerability of agriculture and natural resources. It is due to imbalance and unnecessary use of synthetic agricultural inputs in traditional farming systems. Terefore, improved agricultural technology has to ensure, in traditional farming, safe agricultural produce and bringing down of environmental pollution. Recently, nanotechnology (NT) has been recognized as a promising next-generation technology in the field of agriculture. As an environment-friendly and economically viable tool, the potentiality of nanomaterials (NMs), such as nanosensors, nanopesticides, nanofertilizers, nanocarriers, nanochips, and nano-packaging, has shown great prospect in improving safe agricultural productivity and upholding of environmental safety. Because the use of NMs decreases imbalance and unconscious utilization of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, this minimizes the loss of nutrients and lead to improved agricultural productivity thru the smooth distribution of fertilizers and pesticides, and also improving water and nutrient efficiency. The current review concentrates on the utilization of NT for agricultural sustainability and environmental safety. © 2021"

The premise is twofold: close-grained appreciation of already-interacting biophysical processes allows for the design of complementary social and agricultural systems requiring minimum energy inputs. Secondly, the insistence on campesino smallholders as actors in the design of sustainable food systems directly addresses decades of “top-down” developmental interventions, from Green Revolution experiments in the 1960s and 1970s to international food security programmes in the 1990s. Permaculture connects food insecurity to the delegitimisation of smallholder innovation and insists that, through sharing simple techniques, campesino farmers can contribute towards future-oriented questions of environmental sustainability. This repositioning is brought about through the mobilisation of pedagogical techniques that legitimise the experiences and expertise of small-scale farmers, while standardising experimental methods for testing, evaluating and sharing agroecological practices. Like food sovereignty and food justice movements, Salvadoran permaculture links hunger with longer histories of (uneven) capital accumulation and dispossession and renders campesino farmers its protagonists. By modelling a form of expertise premised in intimate involvement with specific environments, permaculture goes still further, seeking to dislodge a pervasive knowledge politics that situates some as knowers and innovators, and others as passive recipients. This grounds human rights in an ethos of caring for the “more-than-human” world and places emphasis on a corollary right as part of food justice, increasingly being demanded “from below”: the right to know. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Over the last few decades, the food bank movement has emerged as an important and necessary complement to the public sector/governmental food and nutrition safety net for millions of low-income and food insecure populations in the United States and around the world. The food bank system is a private sector, non-governmental initiative, characterized by centralized non-profit organizations which procure, inventory, store and distribute food for multiples of local hunger relief agencies in various communities. From the start of the food bank movement, the effort has been closely linked with the commercial food system. A crucial factor in the establishment and development of the food bank movement has been the role of the food industry in the movement's emergence, the establishment of national networks, and the long-term sustainability of food banks. Since 1979, with the founding of America's Second Harvest (now Feeding America), the food industry, and especially food manufacturers, have been one of the principal sources of food and financial support for the food bank movement; and by extension, the industry has served an important role in reducing hunger in the US and around the globe. This article traces the history of that collaboration, and future trends in the relationship between food banks and the food industry."

Economic crisis, poverty, and hunger have been escalating in different parts of the world due to unsustainable use of natural resources. Thus, the goals of economic and sustainable development should be defined in terms of sustainability of resources: water, energy, and food. Identifying factors affecting these resources, and explaining the interconnectedness between them, is the first step towards sustainable management of natural resources. Several frameworks and models have been designed to help policymakers understand the complexity of the interlinkages between natural resources and assist with planning and regulating these resources. This paper describes a spatial-temporal decision support tool that analyzes energy requirements in the food sector. The tool provides policymakers with essential information to assess which energy inputs in food production are the largest and which factors might influence the increase in energy use over space and time. The tool was developed using a web-based Geographical Information System (GIS) application in a way that allows the user to navigate over different spatial locations, select a point of interest to grow a certain quantity of a specific crop, and calculate water, land, and energy requirements accordingly. This application provides a web-mapping platform and helps users determine when and where they can grow crops based on water and energy requirements objective functions. This application is very helpful for areas with limited information on natural resources. It utilizes satellite imagery to identify major environmental features that are important for analysis. It also allows comparison between different scenarios of food production, promotes natural resources usage efficiency, and encourages greater policy coherence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

A significant portion of this waste accounts for plate waste and food surplus from food-service operations such as restaurants, workplace canteens, cafeterias, etc. In this work, we seek to identify potential strategies to optimize food consumption in all-you-can-eat food-service operations, in terms of minimizing food waste while ensuring quality of service (i.e., maintaining low wait-time, unsatisfied-hunger, and walk-out percentages). We treat these facilities as complex systems and propose an agent-based model to capture the dynamics between plate waste, food surplus, and the facility organization setup. Moreover, we measure the impact of plate size on food waste. The simulation results show reducing plate size from large to small decreases plate waste up to 30% while ensuring quality of service. However, total waste as the sum of food surplus and plate waste is lower with large plates.

Progress is being continued fight against hunger, yet an unacceptably large number of people still, lack the food, and they need an active, healthy, and wealthy life.

Rural and urban differences affect food availability, accessibility, and sustainability; thus, it has a great impact on household food security and dietary diversity. The relationship between the human environment and other factors threatens different domains of food systems resulting in food security. The objective of this study is to determine significant differences between the prevalence of household food security and diet diversity between urban and rural communities in Occidental Mindoro. Specifically, to determine the pattern of usual food intake of preschool children between rural and urban communities Methods. This study utilized a comparative, cross-sectional, analytic study design in order to determine the prevalence of each variable of interest in the two study areas. Radimer-Cornell Tool was utilized to assess the food security status of the household while the FAO-Dietary Diversity Score Questionnaire was used to the diversity of diet among PSC. A total of 480 (rural: n=240; urban: n=240) preschool children were recruited to participate in this study. Ratio and proportion using the point and interval estimate were used to determine the prevalence in different areas, meanwhile, chi-square of homogeneity was used to determine significant difference in the two areas under study. Results. Food insecurity in rural communities was found to be at 56.25% (95% CI: 49.97% to 62.53%) while the prevalence in urban communities was 45.83% (95% CI: 39.53% to 52.14%). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of household food insecurity between rural and urban communities (p=0.0224). Meanwhile, the prevalence of less dietary diversity among preschool children in rural communities was 37.08% (95%: 30.97% to 43.19%) and 26.25% (CI: 20.68% to 31.82%) for urban communities. There was a significant difference in prevalence of low dietary diversity score among preschool children between rural and urban communities (p=0.0107). Conclusion. There were significant differences in terms of household food insecurity and less diverse diet between two community settings. Higher prevalence in rural areas signifies that there is a need to prioritize these vulnerable communities in terms of hunger mitigation and nutrition programs. A combination of milk-rice-meat-fish was observed in the diet of preschool children for both communities however, higher prevalence of less dietary diversity was detected among rural communities. © 2020 University of the Philippines Manila.

Based on extensive original research in Free State Province, South Africa, the book explores how people living in poverty make meaning of their food circumstances within the socio-cultural, political and economic contexts of post-apartheid South Africa, how they view the government�s food security policies and programs and their perceived agency to affect change. The personal narratives contained in the book show that food insecurity is shaped by many issues, among which are structural poverty, racism, attempts or non-attempts at reconciliation during and after apartheid, public health issues such as HIV/AIDS, and environmental circumstances. At a time when most discourse around food insecurity focuses on how to provide more food to people facing hunger, this book's multidimensional approach is a valuable contribution to the contemporary dialogue on poverty, food security/insecurity, sustainability and democratic agency both within South Africa and around the world.

BSF can be reared on a wide range of organic residual streams. This allows for local production within a circular agriculture, decoupling livestock production from import of expensive feed components, such as fishmeal or soymeal. Rearing of BSF can be done by smallholder farmers, thus contributing to their livelihood, economic sustainability and social status. Smallholder farmers contribute importantly to food security, which is a prerequisite for a stable society. In armed conflicts, smallholder farmers are usually the first to suffer. In countries recovering from conflict, agricultural development should focus on restoring food production by smallholder farmers, improving their socio-economic position, thereby contributing to sustainable development goals 2 (zero hunger) and 16 (peace and justice).

However, a proportion of patients achieve inadequate weight loss and some experience weight regain. Little is known of the influence of eating beliefs and behaviours in response to cravings on early weight loss trajectory. This study aimed to identify the post-surgery eating cravings that predicted patients not achieving excess weight loss outcome (EWL) at 6–8 months post-LSG. Design: A total of 106 (80.7% female) participants who underwent LSG from four sites completed the questionnaires at 4–6 weeks post-bariatric surgery and 6 months post-LSG. Achieving <40% EWL at 6-month follow-up was included as the outcome variable, and the nine subscales of the Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait version (FCQ-T) were included as potential predictors of that change. Methods: Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between EWL and the nine subscales of the FCQ-T (intentions to eat, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, lack of control, preoccupation with food, feelings of hunger, negative affect, emotions experienced before or during food cravings or eating, and guilty feelings). Results: Participants lost an average 64% EWL (SD = 21% EWL) 6–8 months after LSG surgery. Results indicated the overall model was significant and, of the nine variables, the emotional food craving subscale (adjusted OR = 4.19, p =.018) predicted a failure to achieve EWL. Conclusion: Emotional food cravings experienced 4–6 weeks following LSG may predict poor weight loss outcomes at 6 months. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Bariatric surgery is currently the most viable and cost-effective treatment for obesity and shows sustainability. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is now the most common procedure. Not all patients achieve excess weight loss outcome (EWL) following LSG. What does this study add? Emotional food cravings contribute to weight loss outcomes at 6 months’ post-LSG surgery. Emotional food cravings may be a maladaptive coping mechanism that represents important area for early psychological intervention. © 2018 The British Psychological Society"

We analyse data from the World Bank National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID-19 NLPS) and the 2018/2019 General Household Survey (GHS). An exact McNemar’s test determined that there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of households that skipped a meal (p =.002), ran out of food (p =.036) or went a whole day without food (p <.001) pre- and during- COVID-19. Approximately 81% perceived COVID-19 as a substantial threat to their income. This was buttressed by the finding that 75% reported a decrease in their total income since the outbreak of COVID-19. Overall, the findings in this paper suggest that COVID-19 posed a substantial threat to the attainment of SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 8.

Therefore, the sustainability of food supply chains has gained ground; however, the sustainability of perishable food supply chains, is still not a fully explored field of study. Therefore, in this research, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to optimize the cost, energy consumption, and the traffic congestion associated with such supply chain operations. In this study, product lifetime uncertainty is explicitly modeled as a Weibull random variable, and food perishability is assumed to be affected by vehicle refrigerator utilization, which is considered as a decision variable. In addition, multiple vehicle types and multiple product types are considered. A dairy supply chain case is investigated, and the interrelations and interactions of all three aspects of sustainability, also known as the three triple bottom lines (TBL) of sustainability, are studied. The results indicate that emphasizing the economic aspect, for highly perishable products, the environmental impact of the chain may increase by 120%, and for the highly congested road networks, the social impact may rise by 51%. However, a 15% economic compromise can improve the sustainability of the supply chain network design by 150%. It is also shown that road congestion and the uncertain perishability of the products are critical factors that can, although differently, affect the operation and the design of the supply chain. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2); Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12); Climate Action (SDG 13) and Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16).

However, a significant population worldwide presently suffers from malnutrition and inadequate access to food. To meet the goal of zero hunger and malnutrition, agricultural production must maintain pace with increasing food demand. This goal is being challenged by rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental issues. Climate change, depleting soil and water resources, air, water and soil pollution are not only reducing productivity, but also pose a threat to food safety and nutrition. This book analyzes linkages between agriculture and environmental changes, major challenges and potential solutions to secure future food security. It covers, in detail, the impacts of major environmental changes including climate change and air pollution on crops and agricultural production. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also discussed. This book provides the reader with a broad view of interactions between agriculture and the environment, where agriculture is not only vulnerable but also acts as a contributor and offers mitigation options for some of the challenges in sustaining future food security. Agricultural sustainability in near and long-term future will depend on adapting crops and crop management practices based on emerging scientific knowledge of plant physiology and resource efficient technologies combined with focused socio-economic reforms to conserve food diversity and traditional practices. With the help of specific case studies, this book also highlights the significance of reforming small scale farming practices. Overall, this book provides the core idea of sustainable agriculture and food production in current and future scenarios, and is recommended for anyone interested in this topic. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Sustainable development in agriculture practices started with focusing on farmers and the information they need to make the land suitable for growing crop varieties, bring their harvest, and get them into the market. To achieve sustainable agriculture, research attention was given to microbes as they are the engineers in the soil and contribute to plant growth, soil fertility, and disease control. Microbes also play a vital role in regulating climate change via the production and consumption of greenhouse gases, removal of pollutants from the environment, and recycle them. They are the sole drivers of the economy to the bioprocess industries and related sectors. Realizing these potentials, microbial biotechnology has made its contribution to sustainable agriculture through producing biofertilizers and improved strains of rhizosphere microbes which assist in other physiological processes such as biological nitrogen fixation, pest control, mineral solubilization, and lignocellulose degradation. Microbial biotechnology is now used to increase the profitability and productivity of the farm, and also in disease prevention and therapy, thereby directly contributing to diverse sustainable development goals. Modern agriculture technologies and management practices have already doubled the production of food over the past half-century. It is believed that a combined operation of an enhanced farming system along with a functional market could contribute to an improved economy, food security, income for farmers, and better land management. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The analyses were based on discussion and independent scoring in a group of 12 participants with academic backgrounds within agricultural or veterinary sciences. We considered all categories of animals; those kept for food production, working and companion animals, but also laboratory and wild animals. The strengths of the links between improving animal welfare and achieving an SDG were scored on a 7-point scale, from being completely indivisible, at one end of the scale, to where it is impossible to reach both the SDG and improved animal welfare at the same time. There was good consensus between participants, with the overall scores being positive, indicating that although animal welfare is not explicitly mentioned in the SDGs, working to achieving the SDGs is compatible with working to improve animal welfare. When analyzing the direction of the links, the impact of achieving an SDG was considered, on average, to be slightly better at leading to improved animal welfare, than the impact of improving animal welfare was on achieving the SDG. The exception to this was for SDG 2, dealing with zero hunger. The two SDGs for which there was strongest mutual reinforcing were SDG 12, which deals with responsible production and consumption, and SDG 14, which deals with life below water. Most of the targets under these two SDGs were considered relevant to animal welfare, whereas when all SDGs were considered, 66 targets of the total of 169 were considered relevant. Although the results of this study suggest a mutually beneficial relationship between improving animal welfare and achieving SDGs, this should be confirmed on a wider group of people, for example people from less developed countries and other stakeholders. Showing the relationships between animal welfare and the sustainable development goals helps highlight the importance of animal welfare when implementing these goals in practice. The methodology described in this study could also be useful to researchers working with other societal and environmental issues not yet considered within the overall SDG framework. © Copyright © 2019 Keeling, Tunón, Olmos Antillón, Berg, Jones, Stuardo, Swanson, Wallenbeck, Winckler and Blokhuis."

International organizations (including regional integration organization as the EU) and State governments refer to different definitions. In the International perspective, policy and definition of food waste have been traditionally developed by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), with the explicit intent to struggle world hunger. Nonetheless, the same initial goal of combatting global food insecurity has been changing recently adding a new perspective to the traditional narrow concept, brought in by sustainability and its broad interpretation including the circular economy target, contained in the 2015 post-Global Millennium Development Goals. The challenge is offering the chance for a clear definition, distinguishing the European framework from the International context only on the basis of the specific scope of such a peculiar Regional Integration Organization. This Article aims to demonstrate that the European definition of food waste has been targeting so far, as for the legislative perspective, the specific goal of environmental impact reduction, which is just one of the numerous aims identified within the International legal framework. The National systems in the European context ask for an unambiguous definition in order to measure and estimate in a credible, practical and consistent manner the extent of loss and waste and to identify where the loss and waste occur. A precise definition will enable countries, companies and other organizations to take sustainable decisions and program their investments. Having a clear and consistent legal framework will certainly assist businesses and regulators to make decisions on a more certain basis. That is a key factor in order to achieve the ambitious target of the circular economy. In the European Union system, there is no specific definition of food waste under the Waste Framework Directive (WFD, No 2008/98/EC). The previous Directive (No 75/442/EEC) containing a definition was amended in 1991 with the addition of ""categories of waste"" (Annex I) and the omission of any reference to national law. A lack of legal clarity under EU law regarding the distinction between waste and non-waste could hinder the efficient use of by-products. That is why the European Parliament has recently called on the EU Commission to develop guidance on the implementation of Article 5 of the WFD which defines by-products. The distinction between waste, by products and end of waste is a key issue in the Circular Economy Package and would also help in raising awareness among food industries, retailers and consumers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Its importance for economic benefits, healthy diets, and nutrition, and achieving sustainable food systems is highlighted by several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), i.e., SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water). However, due to unprecedented population levels, the contribution of the fisheries sector to fulfills these roles is challenging, particularly given additional concerns regarding environmental well-being and sustainability. From this perspective, this study aims to identify the links and trade-offs between the development of this sector and the environmental sustainability in Thailand via a critical analysis of their trends, current ecological impacts, and more importantly, their contributions to several individual SDGs. A time-series of Thailand's fisheries production from 1995 to 2015 indicates a recent reduction from around 3.0 million tons in 1995 to 1.5 million tons in 2015 of wild fish and shellfish from marine and freshwater habitats. The maximum sustainable yield of these species has been exceeded. Conversely, Thailand's aquaculture production has continued to grow over the last decade, resulting in a reduction of mangrove forest area, wild fish stocks, and water quality. While capture fisheries and aquaculture production significantly contribute to several SDG targets, there are potential trade-offs between their development and the achievement of SDGs within the planet dimension, i.e., SDG 6 (CleanWater and Sanitation), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14, and SDG 15 (Life on Land). On the one hand, the mitigation of overfishing will be beneficial for the targets of SDG 14, leading to more sustainable resource management. On the other hand, it might cause a decrease in the volume of marine catches and economic and social profits. We conclude that the SDGs can serve as a framework for both policymakers and industrial workers to monitor and compromise on regulations that will optimize productivity in the context of sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors."

Through a literature review, this paper will demonstrate that supply management, based on consumption, is a solution to food wastage and can in parallel, improve rural wealth, introduce sustainable agricultural practices, resolve major urban pressures and bring about global climate change adaptation.

These endemic species are associated with a rich indigenous knowledge and cultural diversity in relation to their use and conservation. Sphenostylis stenocarpa (ex. A. Rich.) Harms., (African Yam Bean (AYB)), is one such crop within the family of Fabaceae. Its nutritional and eco-friendly characteristics have value in ameliorating malnutrition, hidden hunger and environmental degradation inherent in resource-poor rural and semi-rural communities throughout Africa. However, lack of information from the custodians of this crop is limiting its sustainable development. Therefore, ethnobotanical surveys on the diversity, uses, and constraints limiting the cultivation and use of the crop in southeastern Nigeria were carried out. Five-hundred respondents were randomly selected and data collected through oral interviews and focused group discussion (FGD). Semi-structured questionnaires (SSQ) were also used to elicit information from a spectrum of AYB users comprising community leaders, farmers, market women and consumers in five States. Results showed that the majority of the respondents lacked formal education and were of the age group of 40-50 years, while the female gender dominated with limited access to land and extension officers. Seed coat colour largely determined utilization. Long cooking time, requirement for staking materials, aging of farmers and low market demand were among the major constraints limiting further cultivation and utilization of AYB. In-situ conservation was by hanging dried fruits by the fireside, beside the house, storing in earthenware, calabash gourds, cans and bottles. It is concluded that there is urgent need to scale up conservation through robust linkages between contemporary scientific domains and indigenous peoples in order to harness and incorporate the rich indigenous knowledge in local communities for enhanced scientific knowledge, biodiversity conservation and its sustainable utilization for food security. © 2017 by the authors.

Can increases in food production achieved in the past two decades be sustained in the next two decades? Can developing countries achieve freedom from hunger and malnutrition for their entire populations? How can food security be reconciled with environment quality in an industrializing society? Leading authorities, from soil scientists to economists, address these critical questions in Food Security and Environmental Quality in the Developing World. With a focus on India, this book reviews the state of natural resources, fertilizer and energy needs, and the potential importance of biotechnology as they affect all developing countries. It then addresses issues pertaining to water quality, agricultural chemicals, and pesticide residues on food. Part Three examines water harvesting, post-harvest food losses, storage and processing of animal products, and sustainability and inequality issues. The next sections deal with poverty alleviation, microfinance, gender equity, policy issues, and the role of the public sector. Finally, the book considers emerging issues and priorities. Developing countries have achieved an impressive increase in total food production over the past two decades, but at a high cost to environmental quality. As the populations of these countries continue to grow, soil degradation, pollution and contamination of natural waters, deteriorating air quality, and growing dependence on expensive and diminishing fossil fuels become increasing concerns.

Often the definition of Circular Economy is reduced to recycling exclusively and sometimes even to “recycling at all costs”, even though the waste hierarchy primarily and clearly points into other directions first: reduce, reuse, and if these options have been dealt with exhaustively, recycle. One of zinc's attributes is durability. Zinc is a robust and durable metal and its main application, - protecting steel from corrosion - enhances the life time of steel many times over. Durability leads to a reduced need for raw materials. The challenge is to introduce durability and of course recyclability as well as the in-use stocks of metals (the urban mine) in models that currently are developed to make use of circularity principles in EU legislation, e.g. in the material efficiency standards for product regulations. Frontrunner in the concept of circularity is the Ellen McArthur Foundation which proposes a Circularity Indicator to characterize the level of circularity of products or processes. How do products score that make use of zinc? And is this approach practically applicable? Sustainable development goes beyond the quantifiable, functional features of a product. Contributions to a sustainable development are in part guided by the UN Sustainability Goals (UN SDGs). Zinc is important for “Zero Hunger” (UN SDG 2) or “Good Health and Well-Being” (UN SDG 3). Here the use of zinc in food additives and in fertilizers contributes substantially, because zinc is an essential element to growth and well-being. While circularity is dealt with in LCA approaches, Social Life Cycle Assessment adds yet another dimension of complexity. All models should be scientifically sound with transparent data.

The sector is challenged by many stresses, which led to huge loss in plant productivity worldwide. The ever-increasing population, rapid urbanization with shrinking agricultural lands, dramatic change in climatic conditions, and extensive use of agrochemicals in agricultural practices that caused environmental disturbances confront mankind of escalating problems of food security and sustainability in agriculture. Escalating environmental problems and global hunger have led to the development and adoption of genetic engineering and other conventional plant breeding approaches in developing stress-tolerant varieties of crops. However, these approaches have drawn flaws in their adoption as the process of generating tolerant varieties takes months to years in bringing the technology from the lab to the field. Under such scenario, sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices that avail bacterial usage open the avenues in fulfilling the incessant demand for food for the global population. Ensuring stability on economic fronts, bacteria minimizes plant salt uptake by trapping ions in their exopolysaccharide matrix besides checking the expression of Na+/H+ and high-affinity potassium transporters. Herein we describe information on salinity stress and its effect on plant health as well as strategies adopted by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in helping plants to overcome salinity stress and in mitigating loss in overall plant productivity. It is believed that acquisition of advanced knowledge of plant-beneficial PGPR will help in devising strategies for sustainable, environment-friendly, and climate-smart agricultural technologies for adoption in agriculture to overcome the constrained environmental conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Bhat, Kumar, Bhat, Wani, Dar, Farooq, Bhatti, Koser, Rahman and Jan."

Thus, biotechnology may have the potential to deliver solutions to some of the shortcomings of the green revolution such as the limitations of conventional breeding, poor quality and insufficient quantity of planting materials available to farmers and the negative environmental consequences of high usage of inorganic pesticides and fertilizers.

In this context, cities - having become the main centres of consumption and production worldwide - need to move towards more sustainable and resilient urban development models, considering novel approaches aimed at integrating grey and green infrastructure, economic growth and environmental concerns, knowledge diffusion and poverty and hunger eradication. In this regard, the implementation of urban and peri-urban agroforestry (UPAF) systems - associated with the integration of urban food systems into urban planning - can greatly support the provision of ecosystem services to urban dwellers, thus contributing to the improvement of their livelihood through increased food and nutrition security, energy and fresh water availability, regulation of local climate, carbon sequestration, maintenance of genetic diversity, recreation opportunities and health improvement. In this sense, UPAF is emerging as a new urban practice addressed to promote sustainable land use as well as the integration between urban and rural development. However, its implementation in urban contexts presents several key challenges, such as land tenure conflicts, lack of integration with urban policies and plans and technical knowledge, as well as necessity of innovative governance models. In this context, the aim of this chapter is to outline, through a review of the relevant literature and case studies from both developed and developing countries, the benefits deriving from the implementation of UPAF systems and highlight how these practices can support the improvement of urban sustainability and resilience, particularly in terms of enhancement of provisioning, cultural, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017."

Critical investigation on the food crop-bioenergy trade-offs was conducted while bioenergy development implications were analysed in the context of the four dimensions of food security. Lastly, mitigative measures to bioenergy development impacts were discussed and one key proposition is need to strengthen the second and third generation technology for biofuel production in Nigeria. © 2019 Saheed Matemilola, Isa O.

This movement spoke against the colonial character of the curriculum, demographic representation, institutional cultures, and architecture of the university in South Africa today, which excludes the majority of the students who cannot access higher education in South Africa. It is in this context that the high cost of higher education was questioned, with some questioning the very “idea of the university”, and the role of the university in a society contending with income inequalities, unemployment, and poverty. This article seeks to position food at the centre of decolonising tools towards a sustainable African university of the future. Looking at growing levels of hunger, and the lack of access to food among our students, I argue that in putting food at the centre, regarding our understanding of the curriculum, shape, size, and future of the university in South Africa, we might begin to transform the exclusivist, uncaring and elitist spaces that define a university. In trying to rethink the ‘‘idea of the university’’ in South Africa I look at one of the enduring institutions of knowledge in African societies—uMakhulu (“Senior Mother/Grandmother”) as a body that can reconnect the African university to its matriarchal heritage, in order to define a university that can feed itself beyond the narrow neoliberal understanding of sustainability. © 2019, © 2019 Unisa Press."

We tested this in an Indian context, where an enormous diversity of such plants constitutes a significant part of the rural diet and their acceptance has been high. In this study, we assessed the diversity of wild edible plant resource and the importance of species based on the use and its pattern. We have also shortlisted a set of plants to make an informed decision on prioritization. We found a great variety of plants (1,403 species) from 184 families were consumed across India, although the first 44 families (24%) contributed largely to the (75%) diversity. Leguminosae followed by Compositae, Poaceae, Malvaceae, and Rosaceae, were the families with the highest number of species. We note that a few species from the large pool were extensively used throughout the country while another few were valued for their multiple edible plant parts. Leafy shoots (722 species) followed by fruits (652 species) were the two most-eaten plant parts. Our results strengthen the fact that: (a) wild edibles have been an integral part of the diet; (b) their widespread assimilation into local food culture suggests an untapped potential to ensure easy availability and access to micronutrients for sustainable food systems, and thus in social welfare; and (c) they should be incorporated into the national food policy for formal cultivation and promotion. © Copyright © 2020 Ray, Ray and Sreevidya."

Their objective is to integrate hunger problems with the aims of a food system based on environmental, economic and social sustainability. In this study a comparative analysis of the urban food policies’ actions is conducted, as envisaged in cities around the world. The methodology is based on the community detection method through network analysis, in which the number of actions cities have in common defines their adjacency in the network. The Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, which is a unique city platform worldwide, was used to select the cities and to analyse the actions in them, as classified into six main topics: ensuring and enabling an environment for effective action; sustainable diets and nutrition; social and economic equity; food production; food supply and distribution; and food waste. Three clusters are thus identified: i) agriculture for food security; ii) governance and food economy; and iii) sustainable and healthy consumption.

Conventional agriculture is the mainstream approach to achieving this target but has also caused extensive environmental and social harms. The consensus is that we now need an agriculture that can “multi-functionally” increase food production while simultaneously enhancing social and environmental goals, as committed to in the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Farming also needs to become more resilient to multiple insecurities including climate change, soil degradation, and market unpredictability, all of which reduce sustainability and are likely to exacerbate hunger. Here, we illustrate how agroforestry systems can increase yield while also advancing multiple SDGs, especially for the small developing-world agriculturalists central to the SDG framework. Agroforestry also increases resilience of crops and farm livelihoods, especially among the most vulnerable food producers. However, conventional yield-enhancement strategies have naturally dominated the debate on food production, hindering implementation of more multifunctional alternatives. Governments and institutions now have the opportunity to rebalance agricultural policy and investment toward such multigoal approaches. In doing so, they could achieve important improvements on multiple international commitments around the interlinked themes of food security, climate change, biodiversity conservation, and social well-being. © The Author(s) 2017."

This study attempts a local-level support for the actualisation of Sustainable Development Goal Number 2 (“end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”) by 2030. Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, remote sensing data from Climate Research Unit (CRU) and in-situ data from Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) were analyzed by GIS techniques to map the suitability of rice cultivation in the study area, with the integration of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover, slope, temperature, precipitation and soil parameters (cation exchange capacity, pH, bulk density, organic carbon). We apply the various statistical parameters that include mean spatial NDVI; correlation coefficient, standard deviation and Root Mean Square (RMS) between CRU and NIMET data. Spatial regression trend analysis is conducted between CRU precipitation and NDVI and between CRU temperature and NDVI from 1985 to 2015. The results reveal that NDVI in highly suitable rice planting regions is higher than marginally suitable regions except in the months of October and November, which shows that the highly suitable regions will yield better than the marginally suitable regions during the dry season. Additionally, NDVI is seasonally bimodal in response to precipitation, meaning that vegetation vigor is more dependent on precipitation than temperature. Finally, the correlation coefficient, standard deviation and RMS between CRU and NIMET precipitation data shows 0.42, 108, and 110, respectively, while these three factors between CRU and NIMET temperature data shows 0.88, 1.60, and 0.86, respectively. In conclusion, the MCDM approach reveals that upland is more suitable for rice cultivation in Benue State when comparing with the area provided by the Global Land Cover and National Mappings Organization (GLCNMO) data. © 2019, © 2019 Wuhan University.

However, in this paper, we argue that it can be sustainably managed if the environmental boundary conditions, laid by the traditional customs and practices, are fully respected. We narrate an empirical study from the Zunheboto district of Nagaland, India, where we deployed a mixed research method to explore the Indigenous and Local Knowledge and Practices (ILKPs) associated with shifting cultivation (aka Jhum), particularly concerning farm-level practices, forest and biodiversity conservation, and disaster risk reduction measures. The research method included analysis of primary data obtained through Focus Group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (n = 21), and a questionnaire survey (n = 153) with Jhum farmers from two different age groups, i.e., below 50 years (middle-aged farmers) and above 50 years (older farmers). From the qualitative inquiry, we identified 15 ILKPs, which were then validated from survey responses. We used the Mann–Whitney U test to examine differences in agreement between two groups of framers. Based on this analysis, we conclude that upholding of the ILKPs holds strong potential for the local implementation of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly, SDG-1(No poverty), SDG-2 (Zero hunger), and SDG-15 (Life on land). However, eight of the identified ILKPs showed a statistically significant difference between older and middle-aged farmers, underlining a declining trend. Finally, we suggest suitable policy measures to mainstream ILKPs to balance the trade-offs in food production and biodiversity conservation, and to ensure the future sustainability of Jhum cultivation in the region and beyond. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, irrigated agriculture through water control infrastructure, such as sluices or barrages, weirs and regulators, creates physical barriers that block migration routes of important fish species. Blocking of fish migration routes, leading to a degradation of inland capture fisheries, will undermine Myanmar's efforts to develop sustainably and meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and the sustainability targets within the national Myanmar Sustainable Development Plans, as well as its Agricultural Development Strategy and Investment Plan. Despite the ambitious international and national targets, there is no explicit policy or legislation and no examples of where fish have been considered in the development or operation of irrigation infrastructure in Myanmar.

Emerging research now shows a connection between consumer food waste, healthy diets, and environmental impacts, with implications for food security and hunger. In the United States, the average consumer wastes nearly 1 lb of food every day - approximately one-quarter of edible food purchased. Those who consume healthier diets waste more food than people who consume diets that are less healthy. This food waste accounts for vast amounts of wasted cropland, irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides, and energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.

With the right environment and best management practices (BMPs), the envisaged expectations of the integrated investment can be achieved. This paper compares the economic performance and environmental friendliness of two adaptive integrated aquaculture systems at Njala University fish farm, Sierra Leone. The studies were carried out for six months (June-November, 2014). Fish, rice cum piggery and fish, rice cum poultry production integration platforms were set up to perfect the ideas of integrated fish farming in Sierra Leone. Water quality parameters measured biweekly included: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, water hardness, water alkalinity, ammonia, nitrate, BOD and nitrite. These parameters were determined using Jenway analytical probes and Pondlab multi-parameter kits. Three samples were collected in thoroughly washed 600ml water bottles at each sampling point. Water quality parameters determined in the studies were found to be within the recommended range for the culture of tropical fish species and were not also statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the pH of adaptive research platform (ARP) was slightly acidic. Economic analysis gave a negative incremental benefit and Net Present Value (NPV) for the fish, rice cum piggery synergy in the first year. The calculated benefit/cost ratio for the pig, rice cum piggery production was positive but below 1 (0.87).The system had a negative NPV (-Le 2,990,708), and a payback period of 1.33 years; a net profit of Le 8,944,000 with a gross profit margin of 0.46. The fish, rice cum poultry production, however, gave a positive NPV (Le 841,930.32 (US189.3)) and a cost - benefit ratio of 1.02. Net profit, Gross Profit Margin and the payback period calculated for the investment were Le 13,892,000, 0.34 and 0.98 years, respectively. The poultry project broke even and payback in the first year while the piggery project did not but can only break even and pay back in the second year of production. The culture of genetically poor fish fingerlings, high construction costs of the adaptive research platform, scale of operation and pricing of the farm produce were seen as major causes of reduced profitability. The results obtained from the study, clearly indicate that the two integrated synergies have the potential to help solve the problems of hunger and poverty in Sierra Leone, especially among the rural poor that constituted more than 70% of the population."

Fungus was characterized based on ITS (internal transcribed spacer) regions via clustering approach after isolated from tea plantation area. The higher the NaCl concentration, the more effective the TXD was observed. Improved electron transport rate (ETR), maximum quantum efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm), the effective quantum yield of PS2 (ΦPS2), photochemical quenching (qP) and decreased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was detected in TXD primed plants after NaCl expose.

The actual situation in global food production leads most of the attention to improving accessibility and safety of food, particularly to vulnerable populations. However, in view of the growth in demand, which includes changes in preferences for example towards food of animal origin, availability and continuity will play larger roles in future. Food production needs to increase over the coming decades at challenging rates, while facing problems of degradation and reduced availability of natural resources for production such as soil and water, and facing increasing challenges from climate change. The actual trends in yield development suggest that a simple gradual improvement of production within the existing concepts will not provide a sustainable or feasible solution, and that more fundamental changes in the agricultural production paradigm are required to face these future challenges.

However, because of their bioaccumulation, nondegradability, and the excessive amounts in which they exist, these metals contaminate the food chain and subsequently become a source of toxicity to human beings and the entire ecological function. This is a major issue of concern within the study of environmental science and geochemistry. Although there is a global significance to the issue, it seems more immediate for the developing countries (DCs) such as Nigeria, where the pressure of the teeming population escalates the exigency for human sustainability, food security, and total eradication of hunger. Within the Nigerian context, many studies have examined this all-important issue, but most of these studies are fragmented and limited within the purview of mostly individual states and localities within the country. Taken on a wider geographical scale, the discussions and perspectives of these studies on heavy metal contamination of the food chain offer insufficient insight and expose merely a snapshot of the actual situation. As a result of this, a country-wide knowledge base of the implications of heavy metals on the food chain is lacking. Thus, the present study synthesises existing literature and their findings to create a knowledge base on the vulnerability of the food chain in Nigeria. Aquatic foods, fruits, vegetables, and major staple food such as tubers are the major host of carcinogenic and mutagenic components of heavy metals in Nigeria.

Water resources and irrigated agriculture are not developed to their full potential. Currently less than 4% of renewable water resources in Africa are withdrawn for agriculture. Barriers include the lack of financial and human resources to build irrigation and related rural infrastructure and acquire agricultural technology, and inadequate access to markets.

However, it is unknown how this support is being translated into investment in nutrition. National budgets are important vehicles through which governments communicate intent to address pertinent national challenges. The present paper assesses the nutrition sensitivity of Ghana's budget statement for the year ending 31 December 2014. We perused the budget in its entirety, examining allocations to various sectors with the goal of identifying support for direct nutrition interventions. We examined allocations to various sectors as per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The review shows that the total revenue and grants for the 2014 fiscal year is Ghana Cedis (GH¢) 26 001·9 million (25 % of GDP). The total expenditure for the same period is estimated at GH¢34 956·8 million (33·1 % of GDP). The health sector is allocated GH¢3 353 707 814 (3·8 % of GDP). As of 28 October 2014, the Bank of Ghana's Official Exchange Rate was US$1 = GH¢3·20. It is one of the key sectors whose interventions directly or indirectly impact on nutrition. However, the proportion of the national budget that goes to direct nutrition interventions is not evident in the budget. Nutrition is embedded in other budget lines. Allocations to relevant nutrition-sensitive sectors are very low (<0·5 % of GDP). We conclude that Ghana's 2014 budget statement pays scant attention to nutrition.

Its most succinct description is 'the water-food-energy nexus for a green economy'. The water, food and energy nexus aims at the most efficient, best practice principles applied throughout the full food supply chain. This includes consideration of reducing wastage of the food for various reasons in the supply chain. This paper describes the global opportunities for better efficiency and resources conservation in the water, food, and energy supply chains with examples from Australia. Food wastage equates on average to 243lday-1 of water per person in the food they throw away, which is 1.5 times the daily water use per person in the UK. The concepts of virtual water and water footprint can help in identifying opportunities to save water by targeting reduction of wastage of food that has the highest virtual water content. A green economy aims at achieving optimised supply chain objectives in a manner that espouses the sustainability principle, gives due attention to environmental concerns and helps with eradication of poverty and hunger.

Sustainability must characterize the socio-economic infrastructures as well the scientific and technical components. Today almost half the world population lives on two dollars a day or less and although poor, most are not hungry. WTO objectives for world trade include agriculture and food with the hope of supplying cheap food based on and generated by a capital intensive system. However, the current paradigm of producing ever cheaper food in the West is found to be increasingly unsustainable and, if introduced globally, will create a variety of instabilities. A policy of feeding the growing cities of the developing world with imported Western food would remove domestic markets from poor farmers and would also risk large-scale famine when global food trade breaks down. The only sustainable alternative is to empower poor farmers to help themselves to serve their own domestic markets thus modelling the Western strategy for agriculture which has moved from free trade to protection. The capitalist system must be designed to enhance quality of life by building up and not by destroying rural communities. To achieve this aim the Western concept of cheap food needs replacement by a new paradigm emphasizing quality of life. Global solutions for feeding the developing world require ethical behaviour by rich and powerful nations in addition to technical and economic inputs. Proposals are made to exclude agriculture and food from the WTO, to build-up agriculture and protect domestic food markets in developing countries, to continue but redirect government payments to Western farmers for sustaining natural resources and rural life, and to require consumers to pay the real cost of food. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

With its peculiarities like the life cycle approach, women empowerment, consideration of vulnerable sections in society and proposed reforms in public distribution system (PDS), NFSA is a promising effort for food security in India. The purpose of this paper is to put forth various aspects of NFSA and to identify issues and challenges for its implementation in the light of Indian PDS. Design/methodology/approach - Understanding the implications of NFSA, mapping the existing system of foodgrains distribution in India and analysing existing literature and secondary data available from assorted sources are the steps followed in this endeavour. Findings - Limited resources and exponentially increasing population, lack of infrastructure, operational inefficiencies and poor performance of the PDS are the major hurdles in successful implementation of the proposed act. This study gives emphasis on the need of major reforms in procurement, storage, movement and distribution of foodgrains strategies. Research limitations/implications - This paper focusses mainly on the operational and strategic aspects of PDS and its implications on NFSA. There is a wide scope for future research on sustainability of the act through agricultural and biotechnological innovations, financial analysis and strategic aspects. Originality/value - This study is an unique attempt of mapping and auditing of the entire complex value chain of the Indian PDS for implementation of NFSA. As NFSA is going to redefine the food security aspects, this pioneering work will be useful for researchers and policy makers working in this field in India and other developing countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The 2007-2008 food crisis and ongoing chronic hunger problems clearly demonstrate that millions of people on the continent, including in relatively stable countries such as Kenya, are dangerously vulnerable to economic, political and climatic shocks that threaten food availability and accessibility. At the heart of the strategies to build resilience and tackle food insecurity is the need for effective institutional and policy frameworks that can support local innovations while taking into account the biophysical, social and economic constraints within which rural livelihoods operate. The papers included in this Special Issue of Food Security support the view that for food security initiatives in Kenya to be effective, they must embrace solutions that are equitable, generalizable and ecologically sound to ensure sustainability. Ultimately, to improve innovation and technology adoption, a systems approach that allows women and men, wealthy and poor farmers to engage with scientific and political elites in the design and implementation of food-related research and development initiatives must be embraced. There is also the need to develop tools and approaches that can assist smallholder farmers, researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders to share a better understanding of the multiple factors driving food insecurity and hindering the implementation of effective policies and institutions. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. & International Society for Plant Pathology."

Continentally, less than four percent of Africa's renewable water resources are withdrawn for agriculture and other uses. Investments in agricultural water management can contribute in several ways to achieving the Millennium Development Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and ensuring environmental sustainability. Increased yield and cropping area and shifts to higher valued crops could help boost the income of rural households, generate more employment, and lower consumer food prices. These investments can also stabilize output, income and employment, and have favourable impacts on education, nutrition and health, and social equity. Investments in agricultural water management can cut poverty by uplifting the entitlements and transforming the opportunity structure for the poor. The overall role of investments in agricultural water management in eradicating hunger and poverty is analyzed. This paper contributes to the present debate and efforts to identify strategies and interventions that can effectively contribute to poverty reduction in Africa. It provides an overview of population growth, malnutrition, income distribution and poverty for countries in three case study river basins - Limpopo, Nile, and Volta. With discussions on the contribution of agriculture to national income and employment generation, the paper explores the linkages among water resources investments, agricultural growth, employment, and poverty alleviation. It examines the potential for expansion in irrigation for vertical and horizontal growth in agricultural productivity, via gains in yield and cropping area to boost the agricultural output. Factors constraining such potential, in terms of scarcity and degradation of land and water resources, and poor governance and weak institutions, are also outlined. The paper argues that increased investments in land and water resources and related rural infrastructure are a key pathway to enhance agricultural productivity and to catalyze agricultural and economic growth for effective poverty alleviation. © 2008 The Authors. © 2008 United Nations."

At the same time, over 1 billion people are overweight and obese in both the developed and developing world. Diseases previously associated with affluence, such as cancer, diabetes and cardio-vascular disease, are on the rise. Food system-based approaches to addressing these problems that could enhance food availability and diet quality through local production and agricultural biodiversity often fall outside the traditional scope of nutrition, and have been under-researched. As a consequence, there remains insufficient evidence to support well-defined, scalable agricultural biodiversity interventions that can be linked to improvements in nutrition outcomes.; Agricultural biodiversity is important for food and nutritional security, as a safeguard against hunger, a source of nutrients for improved dietary diversity and quality, and strengthening local food systems and environmental sustainability. This book explores the current state of knowledge on the role of agricultural biodiversity in improving diets, nutrition and food security. Using examples and case studies from around the globe, the book explores current strategies for improving nutrition and diets and identifies key research and implementation gaps that need to be addressed to successfully promote the better use of agricultural biodiversity for rural and urban populations and societies in transition. © 2013 Bioversity International.

It is now widely accepted that poverty and hunger arise not because there are no goods or food, but because billions of people lack income to purchase them. It is also a common belief that the private sector can play a significant role in lifting the poor from the margins of the market system. This would require strategic and mindset shifts in global companies leading to a very different path where their operations intersect with the greater good of communities, societies, and nations. Successful engagement in the untapped market space at the base of the global income pyramid calls for completely new capabilities, responsibilities, and values. Alliance building with local and non-traditional partners, promoting bottom-up solutions and understanding social sustainability are some of these new managerial challenges. This article reflects on some of the critical challenges of global companies and global managers in their strategic engagement at the BOP and explores how large firms can become involved in the pursuit of social capital acquisition and how new approaches of public-private partnerships in reformulating the profit-performance links, the downscaling of products or services without compromising their quality and integrity, the bridging of the information and infrastructure gap, educating, and empowering the poor, together with innovations through technological adaptations can be managed through the embracing of new mindsets.

The responses of 32 operators of these programs were obtained by semi-structured telephone interviews and were analysed using qualitative research methods. Concerned citizens within the community and teachers were the major proponents for programs; their primary indicators of need were children's hunger-related behaviors. Programs generally provided the breakfast or luch meal, were overseen by a board, and were operated by a mix of paid and volunteer staff. A lack of resources, problems with parents and the community, and managerial stresses were the main perceived barriers to program continuance. Programs run by communities generally had more need for resources, expressed lower confidence in their sustainability, and were less likely to cooperate with other groups than school-run programs. While some programs deliberately tried to avoid stigmatization, program operators did hold some prejudicial views about the communities they served and few programs could be considered empowering to users. © 1992."

In this model, society, environment, and technology are interlocking parameters that dictate the nature and types of efforts for sustainability. Society provides for all its citizens the very basic necessities: potable water, food, education, housing, and sanitation. Environment (or ecosystem) includes the natural resources possessed by society. Technology enables the resources to be exploited economically in service to society, and determines the value of the resource. These factors must be considered simultaneously in developing appropriate and sustainable solutions for an environmentally and socially just society. The model is applicable to any country that seeks sustainability and justice for its citizens.

Ensuring that all people have access to adequate and nutritious food produced in an environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. ""Sustainable diets"" have been proposed as a multidimensional framework to address the need for nutritious and adequate food in the context of the many challenges facing the world today: reducing poverty and hunger, improving environmental health, enhancing human well-being and health, and strengthening local food networks, sustainable livelihoods and cultural heritage. This paper examines the contribution of forests and trees to sustainable diets, covering among others, nutritional, cultural, environmental and provisioning aspects. The literature reviewed highlight major opportunities to strengthen the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets. However, several constraints need to be removed. They relate to: cultural aspects, sustainable use of non-wood forest products, organization of forest food provisioning, limited knowledge of forest food composition, challenges in adapting management of forests and trees to account for forest foods, and in integrating forest biodiversity into complex landscapes managed for multiple benefits. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and makes recommendations to enhance the contribution of forest foods to sustainable diets through increased awareness and better integration of information and knowledge on nutritious forest foods into national nutrition strategies and programs. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Its assumed main ethical value is the concept of justice as fair distribution of outputs, with the main aim to reduce hunger and to optimalize sustainability. Although this paradigm can be proud of its enormous success to feed the world, it also produces huge problems, which make it unsustainable and not fair. The approach decreases biodiversity, increases erosion, is animal unfriendly and depletes scarce resources. It has an huge impact on climate change and its economic and patenting system increases the gap between rich and poor, thereby reducing chances for rural livelihood, producing unemployment, inherently instable social relations and food insecurity. Probably, it can produce food for even more than eight billion in 2050 with enormous cost. The agrosystem approach, its alternative, starts with local farming practices and innovation activities. It implicitly acknowledges the ethical value of how to lead a good life. However, variants of this approach either give farmers full priority in what and how to produce (as in agrarianism) or give consumers the lead (as in urban gardening). The current utilitarian and deontological ethical approaches are quite blind for how to deal with these strategies that cut across justice, good life and other values. Due to the dynamics of social, economic and cultural systems, agricultural priorities cannot anymore be established one sided by either farmers (and producers) or consumers. Sustainability and climate change require changing consumer food styles (in expanding urban areas) and new farming styles. To improve the approach of agrosystem into one of plural and democratic agrosystems, I propose to make room conceptually for the negotiation and cooperation of farmers and consumers about their interests, preferences and values. In this revised agrosystem approach a concept of justice is assumed not as fair distribution but as fair recognition of farming and food styles. This ethical notion enables to take into account the pluralism of farming and food styles and various interactive ways of intensification and innovation with consumers. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

About 80% of the total population live in rural areas. The contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product is 30%. Rice is the major food crop while jute, sugarcane and tea are the main cash crops. Other important crops are wheat, tobacco, pulses, vegetables and fruits. Overall productivity in Bangladesh is stagnating or declining. The implication of yield stagnation or declining productivity is severe, since these trends have occurred despite rapid growth in the use of chemical fertilisers. Depletion of soil organic matter is the main cause of low productivity, which is considered one of the most serious threats to the sustainability of agriculture in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, most soils have less than 17 g/kg and some soils have less than 10 g/kg organic matter. Farmers realise that there is a problem with soil fertility related to organic matter depletion. Farmers say that organic matter increases yield, reduces the production cost, improves crop growth and the economy, increases water-holding capacity and improves the soil structure. They recognise soil with higher organic matter content by darker brownish to black in colour. Some farmers are using fast-growing trees such as Flemingia macrophyla, Ipilipil (Leucaen leucophala), Glyricidia sepium, Boga Medula (Tephrosia candida), Dhol Kolmi (Ipomoea fistulosa), etc., as living fences, which can be used as fuel, fertiliser and fodder. To increase the soil organic matter, farmers use green manure crops, compost, quick compost, cow dung, azolla, etc. However, fuel for cooking purposes is limited and cow dung and crop residues are largely used as fuel. Crop residues are also used as fodder for livestock. Farmers expressed the wish to learn more about organic fertilizer management. However, sufficient food should be produced to keep pace with population growth. To alleviate the hunger and poverty is to increase the intensity of agricultural production and maintain favorable ecological conditions. Therefore, more organic matter should be used in the farmers' fields to sustain the soil fertility in an intensive farming system."

Agriculture is the dominant sector in rural areas and has the greatest concentration of poverty: landless workers, small tenant farmers, and small farm owners. Thus, any development strategy that is directed towards increasing employment and alleviating a country's hunger must concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth. Historically, economic development, in most countries, has been based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly land resources - in large part because these resources have been undervalued by private markets and political systems. Soil erosion and land degradation have been serious worldwide. Due to reasons such as high population pressure on land, and limited fossil energy supplies, land degradation is more serious in the developing world. Empirical studies show that soil erosion and degradation of agricultural land not only decrease land productivity but that they can also result in major downstream or off-site damage (e.g. reduction of hydroelectric production) which may be several times that of on-site damage. An earlier analysis identified the factors that determine the agricultural production growth rate in 28 developing countries. This study involved statistical estimation of an aggregate agricultural growth function based on cross-country data. The overall results showed that price distortions in the economy and land degradation had statistically significant negative impacts while the change in arable and permanent land was positively related to the growth of agricultural production and food production in 28 developing countries from 1971 to 1980. These results emphasize the importance of 'getting prices right' and implementation of sustainable land and water management practices if future growth in food and agricultural output is to be realized and sustained in developing countries. © 1993."

Within this development public subsidies have played a major role by making biogas production from raw plants highly competitive. Social acceptance should be important in contemporary political decision making: that is why we decided to ask people for their perceptions of and their attitudes towards biogas production in agriculture. We used a two-step approach, starting with the conduction of focus groups discussions in three German cities, followed by an online survey. The content of the online survey was based on the outcome of the focus group discussions. By means of factor and cluster analyses we classified the respondents into homogenous groups with regard to their attitudes towards biogas production. The results show that citizens' knowledge of biogas production and of its possible consequences is low. Generally, the production of biogas is well accepted by German citizens. They acknowledge biogas production to be a form of renewable energy, which contributes to overall sustainability goals. But, people are concerned about competition of biomass production for electricity and feed and food production, having in mind that hunger is an important issue worldwide. According to the test person's opinion organic waste should be preferred over fresh biomass. In contrast to what had been expected from earlier media reporting, neither changes in the landscape due to high shares of maize nor significant annoyances of people living close to biogas facilities caused by noise, smell or dirty roads were feared. The factor and cluster analyses resulted in the following groups of people: 'Opponents', 'Indifferents' and 'Supporters' of biogas production. The results of our research confirm earlier research outcomes on German citizens' attitudes in favour of fostering the use of renewable energies. Consistently, people also support the use of biogas. But, people are concerned about the likely competition of land used for the production energy plants with that used for food and feed. Considering that biogas production from energy plants causes quite high CO2-abatement costs, resolute political action towards replacing energy plants in biogas production is urgently needed."

By recognizing the diversity of territories and their distinct capacity to react to shocks (external and internal), a territorial approach is also suitable for tackling the sources of inequality. This involves putting local institutions at the forefront of the battle against FSN problems in order to ensure the achievement of the triple objective of equity, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. The paper acknowledges that following a territorial approach is complex and often connected to a number of prerequisites that are sometimes not available in developing countries. These include efficient governance systems, access to information, and capacities of actors, organizations and institutions at all levels. Notwithstanding this, our examples indicate that the chances of success of territorial approaches in developing countries are not necessarily lower than for other countries, if appropriate actions are taken. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology."

Together these outputs should create greater environmental, social and economic sustainability. These goals mirror those of agroforestry, which has been described as a significant mechanism for the delivery of multifunctional agriculture. Agroforestry outputs are delivered in three steps: i) rehabilitation of degraded land; ii) the domestication of underutilised plant species; and iii) the commercialisation of agroforestry tree products (AFTPs). Interestingly, past crop domestication has been credited with being a ""perquisite for the development of settled, politically centralised, socially stratified, economically complex and technologically innovative societies"". While there is good evidence of this, the benefits of modern agriculture based on staple food crops have not been equitably distributed and developing country farmers have been marginalised. In the mid-1990s a new wave of participatory crop domestication was initiated. This second wave of domestication, led by the World Agroforestry Centre, has focused on underutilised tropical trees producing highly nutritious fruits and nuts which provide the everyday needs of smallholder farmers. Recent evidence from Cameroon indicates that the domestication of these new tree crops within an integrated approach to rural development delivering multifunctional agriculture, can transform the lives of poor farmers. It also has positive impacts on the environment and creates new business and employment opportunities in rural communities. Thus it seems that, if widely implemented, this new pro-poor wave of domestication could have large impacts on global food production and the alleviation of malnutrition, hunger and poverty in developing countries."

First, indigenous peoples themselves continue to be subjected to the shock impact of outsiders in ways that remove their traditional access to land and other resources, especially those that provide customary sources of foods. The shock is therefore very negative in nutritional as well as the better-known cultural and health terms. Second, the destruction and disruption of many indigenous peoples is reducing the pool of knowledge (""ethnoschience"") available concerning the biosphere and natural resources, which is of widespread value to humanity. Thirdly, this compounds the already well-known shock impact of the ""invaders"" on those natural resources through environmental destruction and habitat alteration.

Indeed, in addition to protein energy malnutrition underweight and micronutrient deficiencies affect a high proportion of children and women. Conversely, changes in dietary habits and physical activity patterns have led to emergence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, hyperlipidaemia, CHD and cancer. One possible explanation of weight gain and its associated health consequences is the trend of the consumption of already prepared meals and the restaurants that are in continuous development leading to high consumption of foods rich in sugar and fat. The health problems associated with NT have not spared populations in the Mediterranean area where the type of diet is reported to be healthy and to protect against cardiovascular risks. This is seen in North Africa that belongs also to the Mediterranean basin, where the nutritional situation raises the problem of traditional foods sustainability. Accurate nutritional policy and education are needed to redress the effects of malnutrition related to NT on health. © The Authors 2014."

The water needed to produce a nutritionally acceptable diet for one person is however 70 times as large as the amount needed for domestic water supply. The food security dilemma is largest in arid climate regions, a situation constituting a formidable challenge. It is suggested that an additional 5 600 km3/yr of consumptive water use will be needed to produce an adequate amount of food by 2050 - i.e almost a doubling of today's consumptive use of 6800 km3/yr. Past misinterpretations and conceptual deficiencies show the importance of a shift in thinking. Combining the scale of the challenge and the time scale of the efforts to feed humanity and eradicate hunger leads to an impression of great urgency. This urgency strengthens the call for international research both for supporting agricultural upgrading, and for much better handling of issues of environmental sustainability. What stands out is the need of a new generation of water professionals, able to handle complexity and able to incorporate water implications of land use and of ecosystem health in integrated water resources management. It will for those reasons be essential and urgent to upgrade the educational system to producing this new generation. © 2007 Springer."

At the same time, there is significant financial risk associated with food production and the challenges that Vermont farmers face in achieving business viability.

This research draws insights from two projects in Tanzania funded by the United States under its Feed the Future initiative. The research examined the categories of farmers participating, production structure employed, and the implications for sustainable and inclusive food security and agricultural development. The research reveals that significant results of sustainable production can be found at individual level, but only a limited number of farmers with endowment of suitable land with access to water, and credit and some level of organization are participating. The UN rapporteur on the Right to Food has called for increasing food production where the poor and hungry live; we argue that current investment approaches oriented to increasing production, fail to adequately address the local specificity of hunger. As a result, substantial increases in aid inflows over the recent years may have limited effect on reducing the numbers of the hungry. The challenge to stakeholders is to spread the technologies to many more smallholder producers, particularly targeting the poor more precisely. © 2014 by the author(s)."

Much of the literature suggests that post-apartheid interventions have not been successful at improving small-scale agriculture, which is seen as an important vehicle for improving rural food security. Nevertheless, data from the General Household Survey (GHS) indicate that household hunger levels have declined substantially in the post-2000 decade across the entire nation (as other estimates of household poverty have also indicated). In particular, this paper demonstrates that this trend has been more pronounced in the former homeland regions, eliminating the previously higher incidence of hunger there. Using linear probability models, this paper seeks to isolate which factors have led to the convergence of the homeland regions household hunger levels and those of households residing in non-homeland parts of the country. The historical context that is sketched here highlights the severe challenges faced by farmers in former homeland areas; this raises the question how convergence in food security occurred, given that many agricultural interventions in rural areas (also in homelands) have not attained the success that was hoped for. In particular, the proportionately larger reliance on social grants in homelands regions accounts for a part of the faster reduction in hunger levels there. Communal gardens and connections to the agricultural market have also reduced hunger within former homelands regions. The long-term sustainability of grants in bolstering food security is of concern, highlighting the need for greater market integration of small-scale farmers in homeland regions. © 2014 © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa."

Due to their link with local cultural experiences, tasting local food and beverages has been found to not only appease hunger but also serve as one of the unique and original attractions during a holiday. The promotion of local and regional food will not only elevate the tourism industry but also contributes towards tourism sustainability as it leads to preservation of culinary heritage as well as adding value to a destination’s authenticity (du Rand and Heath, 2006). There is a need to use food unique to a destination as an effective marketing tool and at the same time take into account how to develop food as part of a cultural tourism product for a destination in a sustainable way. The use of this kind of food can be effectively incorporated in the tourism marketing of a destination by taking into account aspects such as: (1) factors that influence tourists or travellers to experience local food and beverages on trips and holidays, (2) satisfying tourists’ palette without compromising its original state, (3) developing a clear and consistent ‘food identity’, and (4) the issue of preserving the local distinctiveness valued by tourists especially in the face of globalization pressures. More work appears to be in need with regard to the potentials of indigenous food in elevating the tourism industry. The purpose of this paper is to assess the viability and potentiality of indigenous food as an effective marketing or promotion tool for a destination’s cultural tourism development. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London."

At the same time, the demand for sustainable seafood has never been greater. By presenting three challenges to marine biology, this article explores how we may be able to throw light upon practical measures that can mitigate, redress and avert some of the worst future scenarios whilst continuing to supply, and even increase, economic, social and nutritional benefits from seafood. First, I present a rigorous, multi-disciplinary, semi-quantitative ecosystem evaluation framework (EEF) that characterises the essential ecological features of different marine ecosystems and can evaluate the status of threats. The general framework is designed to work in the face of ignorance and quantifies uncertainty. An example is presented from recent work on seamounts. Second, a desperate need for food supplies will almost inevitably lead to further fishing down the trophic levels in marine food webs. Some have argued to do this deliberately to mitigate global problems of hunger, especially in the face of concerns about the sustainability of terrestrial agriculture, and we can be sure that economic pressures and market values for increasingly scarce protein will lead to tendencies of this type. One example is a possible increased exploitation of krill, which at first sight presents vastly increased amounts of protein that could be harvested. Here, I show how large but potentially sustainable levels of catch may be estimated in a precautionary fashion. Third, inter alia, a practical restoration agenda is discussed. The importance of historical reconstruction is exemplified by 'Back to the Future' research which attempts to use quantitative descriptions of past ecosystems to emplace practical restoration goals for management (such as Optimal Restorable Biomass, ORB), while quantifying risks in the management of marine ecosystems from climate and uncertainty. All three areas and their examples represent work-in-progress, and their credibility and utility pivot on the quality of our insight into critical ecological processes and on the widespread adoption of rational, precautionary policies. Moreover, they present profound scientific and human challenges to the science of marine biology. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Critics have argued that, with rapid worldwide population growth, real estate will not be as easily available in the future, which might threaten the sustainability of solar power plants-so-called solar farms (NSS 2013). Scholars have also expressed skepticism about wind energy, arguing that some consider onshore wind farms unpopular, and citing bird mortality as an undesirable side eect of this source of sustainable energy (Bryce 2009). Some economists have also argued that biofuels have been inducing agriculturists to produce fuel instead of food in what is, in eect, a natural cannibalization of agricultural goods destined for consumption, mankind’s major source of sustenance. ese economists have said that, if this trend continues, the current number of undernourished people, which amounted to an estimated 925 million people in 2010, will continue to increase (World Hunger Organization [WHO] 2010). © 2014 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The essay also outlines ways in which the present political climate is presenting a challenge to sustainable agriculture proponents, who, in response, are building new linkages with urban interests, including anti-hunger organization. Despite abstract philosophical and more real political problems, a community food security agenda is being crafted, joining the interests of small farms, family farm, and sustainability advocates, and anti-hunger groups.

Approximately one billion people have inadequate protein intake. The challenge of preventing hunger and malnutrition will become even greater as the global population grows from the current 7.2 billion people to 9.6 billion by 2050. With increases in income, population, and demand for more nutrient-dense foods, global meat production is projected to increase by 206 million tons per year during the next 35 years. These changes in population and dietary practices have led to a tremendous rise in the demand for food protein, especially animal-source protein. Consuming the required amounts of protein is fundamental to human growth and health. Protein needs can be met through intakes of animal and plant-source foods. Increased consumption of food proteins is associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and overutilization of water. Consequently, concerns exist regarding impacts of agricultural production, processing and distribution of food protein on the environment, ecosystem, and sustainability. To address these challenging issues, the New York Academy of Sciences organized the conference ""Frontiers in Agricultural Sustainability: Studying the Protein Supply Chain to Improve Dietary Quality"" to explore sustainable innovations in food science and programming aimed at producing the required quality and quantity of protein through improved supply chains worldwide.

The risks that come with climate change make this task more daunting. However, hundreds of thousands of rain fed smallholder farmers in Zambia, Malawi, Niger, and Burkina Faso have been shifting to farming systems that are restoring exhausted soils and are increasing food crop yields, household food security, and incomes. This article reviews these experiences, and their broader implications for African food security, as manifestations of Evergreen Agriculture, a fresh approach to achieving food security and environmental resilience. Evergreen Agriculture is defined as the integration of particular tree species into annual food crop systems. The intercropped trees sustain a green cover on the land throughout the year to maintain vegetative soil cover, bolster nutrient supply through nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling, generate greater quantities of organic matter in soil surface residues, improve soil structure and water infiltration, increase greater direct production of food, fodder, fuel, fiber and income from products produced by the intercropped trees, enhance carbon storage both above-ground and below-ground, and induce more effective conservation of above- and below-ground biodiversity. Four national cases are reviewed where farmers are observed to be applying these principles on a major scale. The first case involves the experience of Zambia, where conservation farming programmes include the cultivation of food crops within an agroforest of the fertilizer tree Faidherbia albida. The second case is that of the Malawi Agroforestry Food Security Programme, which is integrating fertilizer, fodder, fruit, fuel wood, and timber tree production with food crops on small farms on a national scale. The third case is the dramatic expansion of Faidherbia albida agroforests in millet and sorghum production systems throughout Niger via assisted natural regeneration. The fourth case is the development of a unique type of planting pit technology (zai) along with farmer-managed natural regeneration of trees on a substantial scale in Burkina Faso. Lastly, we examine the current outlook for Evergreen Agriculture to be further adapted and scaled-up across the African continent. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. & International Society for Plant Pathology."

As such, the provision of water which go beyond domestic to include water for small-scale productive uses should be encouraged to enhance peoples' livelihood options by making significant contribution to household income, food security, improved nutrition and health. All these multiple benefits, if combined can assist in the fight against hunger and poverty. This study was conducted in Mashonaland East province, covering Marondera, Murehwa and Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe districts in Zimbabwe for the period December 2005-May 2006 to assess factors which affect multiple uses of water sources at household level. Participatory Rural Appraisal tools such as discussions, observations and interviews were used for data collection. The survey found that people indeed require water for productive purposes apart from domestic uses, which are often given top priority. The study found out that multiple uses of water sources at household level can be affected by segmentation of water services into domestic and productive water supply schemes, technology and system design, water quality and quantity and distance to water sources among other factors. The study recommends that water service providers to be able to provide appropriate, efficient and sustainable services, they should understand and appreciate that people's water needs are integrated and are part and parcel of their multifaceted livelihood strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

First, agriculture produces a wide array of local and national nonmarket goods and services (in addition to market commodities) collectively known as multifunctionality of agriculture. Second, agriculture is intimately associated with global public goods of grave importance to humanity such as climate change, sustainability, and food security (poverty/hunger) in developing countries that require transnational cooperation to minimize free-rider and consequent under-provision problems. Third, embodying the first and second problems, agriculture plays distinctively different roles across countries. Specifically, this article views the global agriculture as consisting of four broad groups of countries with widely divergent needs from agriculture. This article concludes that the above agriculture-related problems are too diverse and complex to be left to free trade. When the global community is too much preoccupied with the illusive mission of agricultural trade liberalization, the great danger is that such preoccupation may distract it from effectively addressing the agriculture-related problems of the 21st century in a timely manner that pose imperative challenges to humanity.

Over the past decade, various levels of government in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda have introduced policy to respond to urbanization, most of which notes the importance of a sustainable focus. Yet, this policy fails to identify urban food security as a concern, beyond some limited attention to urban agriculture.

Both household coping strategies and larger-scale economic development efforts have caused severe natural resource degradation that limits future economic opportunities and endangers ecosystem services. A model based on a business infrastructure has been developed to promote and maintain sustainable agricultural and natural resource management practices, leading to direct and indirect conservation outcomes. The Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) model operates primarily with communities surrounding national parks, strengthening conservation benefits produced by these protected areas. COMACO first identifies the least food-secure households and trains them in sustainable agricultural practices that minimize threats to natural resources while meeting household needs. In addition, COMACO identifies people responsible for severe natural resource depletion and trains them to generate alternative income sources. In an effort to maintain compliance with these practices, COMACO provides extension support and access to high-value markets that would otherwise be inaccessible to participants. Because the model is continually evolving via adaptive management, success or failure of the model as a whole is difficult to quantify at this early stage. We therefore test specific hypotheses and present data documenting the stabilization of previously declining wildlife populations; the meeting of thresholds of productivity that give COMACO access to stable, high-value markets and progress toward economic self-sufficiency; and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices by participants and other community members. Together, these findings describe a unique, business-oriented model for poverty alleviation, food production, and biodiversity conservation."

The mechanisms that regulate energy balance have substantial built-in redundancy, overlap considerably with other physiological functions, and are influenced by social, hedonic and psychological factors that limit the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. It is therefore unsurprising that anti-obesity drug discovery programmes have been littered with false starts, failures in clinical development, and withdrawals due to adverse effects that were not fully appreciated at the time of launch. Drugs that target pathways in metabolic tissues, such as adipocytes, liver and skeletal muscle, have shown potential in preclinical studies but none has yet reached clinical development. Recent improvements in the understanding of peptidergic signalling of hunger and satiety from the gastrointestinal tract mediated by ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and of homeostatic mechanisms related to leptin and its upstream pathways in the hypothalamus, have opened up new possibilities. Although some have now reached clinical development, it is uncertain whether they will meet the strict regulatory hurdles required for licensing of an anti-obesity drug. However, GLP-1 receptor agonists have already succeeded in diabetes treatment and, owing to their attractive body-weight-lowering effects in humans, will perhaps also pave the way for other anti-obesity agents. To succeed in developing drugs that control body weight to the extent seen following surgical intervention, it seems obvious that a new paradigm is needed. In other therapeutic arenas, such as diabetes and hypertension, lower doses of multiple agents targeting different pathways often yield better results than strategies that modify one pathway alone. Some combination approaches using peptides and small molecules have now reached clinical trials, although recent regulatory experience suggests that large challenges lie ahead. In future, this polytherapeutic strategy could possibly rival surgery in terms of efficacy, safety and sustainability of weight loss. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

To feed the increasingly growing population, on the one hand, balanced, broad-based pro-poor growth-oriented programs are generally required to increase food production, agricultural productivity and rural income and, on the other hand, special targeted programs are necessary to alleviate hunger. Suc-cess mostly depends on having conducive policies, adequate institutions, im-proved market infrastructure, social safety nets and primarily peace and sta-bility, all on a sustainable basis. In this paper, our attempt is to outline the key issues that allow shifting our priority attention from a common understanding of the major causes behind the problems to concrete actions that must be implemented, in view of fighting hunger and achieving food safety, water security and environment sustainability."

One ""quick-win"" proposal is replenishment of soil nutrients for smallholder farmers, through free or subsidised chemical fertilisers. Other proposals include appropriate irrigation technology, improved inputs and interventions targeted at women. Analysis of over 10 years of agro-hydrological and agro-economic studies from southern African show that a different approach is required to interventions proposed. There are sustainability problems with free chemical fertiliser due to transport costs and ancillary costs. Furthermore, recent studies in Zimbabwe and Mozambique show that significant increases in yield can only be obtained when soil fertility management is combined with good crop husbandry, e.g. timely planting and weeding. Ongoing replenishment of fertility would be dependent on a continued free or subsidised fertiliser supply, and transport system. Increasing access to irrigation will help, but is not the only solution and cannot reach even a majority of farmers. It has been determined that short dryspells are often the major cause of low yields in sub-Saharan Africa. Soil-water conservation approaches, e.g. winter weeding and conservation tillage, can reduce risk and increase yield. The following specific recommendations are made for urgent interventions to contribute sustainably to food security in southern Africa: (i) To increases access to fertiliser, consider development of strong input markets at end-user level. (ii) Intensification of technology transfer, focusing on capacity building for transfer of existing technologies and much closer collaboration between state and NGO sectors, agronomists and water engineers. (iii) Increasing the uptake of soil-water conservation methods, including conservation tillage and weeding, and supplementary irrigation to minimise adverse effects of dryspells, through investments in farmer training.

The paper then proposes that community food systems may play an important role in mitigating the adverse environmental, economic and social effects of the dominant food system, by the use of more sustainable food production methods, the development of local economies and enabling closer connections between farmers and consumers. There are many opportunities for public health nutritionists to contribute to the local food system literature to ascertain whether these systems improve inequities, provide better access to healthy food and help stem the tide of rising global obesity levels.

In contrast, there are many people, particularly in Europe, who are worried that food, made by the same new technology, may harm their health or cause damage to the environment. This is despite the growing evidence that genetically modified crops have the potential to improve world food security and the fact that there have, as yet, been no adverse results of their use in the food chain. Because of these worries and the mechanisms of politics, agricultural biotechnology has become the target of concerns about food safety (BSE, Foot & Mouth Disease), along with globalisation and the power of multinational companies. These concerns will, hopefully, be overcome by a more open and well-informed dialogue between scientists, opinion leaders, educators and the public.

It is however clear that bridging the nutrition divide is fundamental to bridging economic, gender and technological divides. South Asia, in particular, is a major hunger hot spot of the world. However, experience in China, Thailand and some parts of India has shown that through an appropriate blend of technology, public policy and peoples' participation, rapid progress can be made in eliminating endemic hunger caused by poverty, and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients in the diet. Community centered and controlled nutrition security systems based on a whole life cycle approach to nutrition support programs are the most cost-effective. Also, an economic stake in the conservation and enhancement of natural resources like land, water, biodiversity and forests is essential, if, sustainable development is to be achieved in perpetuity."

How is it possible that we are now capable of producing enough food for all of humanity and that, at the same time, tens of thousands of people are allowed to die every day? Will we go lazily on shunning reality, submerged in passivity and oblivious to the havoc wreaked by virulent poverty? Undoubtedly periods of worsening crisis - ecological, environmental and economic-like the present, aside from their inherent and manifest negativity, represent a real opportunity to examine and question fundamental aspects of our growth model, as well as to revise ways of using natural resources and means of coexistence that have been in practice until now. For that reason the goal of the present talk is to deal with some of the key elements explaining and demonstrating the reasons for the unviability of the present model of development, while at the same time correcting the domination that has historically characterized western man's relationship to nature. Which, besides its seamlessly integrated progress, generates so much hunger and misery everywhere. So it is that the only dwelling suitable for hunger must be the museum of history, definitively forming part of an atavistic past, burdened down by inequality and a biting injustice. Nonetheless, to ensure that this proposal become effective, the problem has to be rethought, but beyond political and economic thinking, or eminently technical analysis chained to instrumental rationality.

This may prove critical in tropical regions where most agriculture is in rain-fed systems and climate change may have a potentially large influence on productivity. By adversely affecting food and water resources, climate change thus threatens progress and efforts made in poverty reduction, economic growth, and achievement of further Millennium Development Goals, such as ending hunger on our planet and achieving environmental sustainability. The intensification of food production transformed formerly small-scale traditional systems to modern large-scale monocultures, e.g. in Latin America. However, banana monoculture production by smallholders is also found in many parts of the world, for example in countries such as St Lucia, which is a major banana-producing country in the Caribbean Windward Islands. Mono-cropping farmers increasingly need to deal with the fact that modern intensive agricultural systems which are characterized by increased need for fertilizers and irrigation, i.e. nutrients and water, may become more sensitive to climate change in terms of lower productivity, higher vulnerability, and reduced sustainability in the future. Moreover, food systems in developing countries are currently experiencing enormous organizational changes, reflected in the ongoing reorganization of supply chains, ranging from farm to fork. Being at the end of the chain, particularly the small-scale producers have to cope with global consumers’ demands, reflected in the necessity to deliver high-quality products on time and at competitive prices. These high requirements can represent a serious barrier to small farmers’ participation in higher value chains, e.g. in the Caribbean Island of St Lucia. St. Lucia’s farmers therefore need to diversify their production, e.g. by adopting fair trade production standards, and tap new domestic as well as niche markets by means of improved commercialization to sustain food security and poverty reduction endeavors. Considering that small island developing states like St Lucia, where agriculture still represents the backbone of a society increasingly have to face these two global challenges – globalized markets and climate change – and recognize their impacts already today, this paper will explore the future impacts of climate change on the Caribbean region, discuss the potential impacts of climate change for smallholder agriculture in St Lucia, and elaborate on the importance of information, training and capacity building, not only in terms of improved diversification and commercialization of agricultural produce, but also for raising the adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers in St Lucia by providing sustainable adaptation options for farm-level diversification in the light of climate change. © 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

The aim of this paper was to investigate the role of tenure security in north-east Ghana and the implications for agricultural production and environmental sustainability. The research used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, focus group discussions and questionnaires to collect and analyse data from stakeholders in two selected districts in north-east Ghana The study revealed that contrary to the mainstream view that lack of security of customary land tenure is the main cause of the poor agricultural production and environmental degradation, stakeholders' perceptions of their security of tenure was generally high. Yet poor agricultural production and environmental degradation characterised the study area. Interviewees perceived the main causes to be due to non-tenurial factors including lack of finance, poor soil fertility, inadequate and unreliable rainfall, pests and diseases, inadequate farmlands, bush burning and excessive tree cutting. It was also shown in the study that women and strangers (i.e. non-community members) generally had little or no power and control over land use decision-making and management under customary land tenure. These findings have negative implications for tenure security and environmental sustainability in north-east Ghana, since most women are involved in food production. The paper concludes that current policy focus on enhancing tenure security may fail to lead to increased agricultural production and environmental sustainability if similar focus is denied the above non-tenurial factors.

The power of these technologies is unlike any the scientific world of biology has yet seen, and they are responsible for a true biological revolution. The ability to move genes and groups of genes at will, to decipher, to 'see,' and to manipulate the molecular codes that make us individuals, as well as to 'demystify' the genetic makeup of organisms in nature - these tools are now spread before us. The potential risks of biotechnology go well beyond those we face directly as humans. They go to the very heart of what makes our world survive: the ecosystems in which we live and the organisms, both plant and animal, that make those ecosystems function. New technologies as powerful as those of biotechnology carry with them the burden of making wise and informed decisions of how to use them by asking and answering questions about their safety and assessing what risks are acceptable to human society. It is up to all of us as scientists, policymakers, and concerned members of civil society to make those decisions. The panel's recommendations to the World Bank are based on its members' belief that urgent priority must be assigned to the expansion of agriculture and to increased production of food in the developing world. It is critically important that increases in food production outpace population growth. Damaging agricultural practices must be replaced with lower-impact, sustainable activities so that the global capacity to produce food does not decline. Only by these means will it prove possible to lessen hunger and improve food security in the poorest nations in the years ahead. Because transgenic technology is so powerful, it has the ability to make significant positive or negative changes in agriculture. Transgenic crops are not in principle more injurious to the environment than traditionally bred crops. This report has outlined a number of criteria that can be used to determine whether a specific biotechnology program is likely to enhance or detract from ecologically sound crop production. Transgenic crops that are developed and used wisely can be very helpful, and may prove essential, to world food production and agricultural sustainability. Biotechnology can certainly be an ally to those developing integrated pest management (IPM) and integrated crop management (ICM) systems. The recommendations to the World Bank follow."

Employing a governance approach, the chapter focuses on the pivotal role of GlobalG.A.P. in shaping rural livelihoods and sustainability objectives for the agriculture and food sector in developing countries. In pursuit of its objectives, this chapter presents the evolving governance structures, aims and rhetoric of GlobalG.A.P., and evaluates its effectiveness and (perceived) legitimacy. The analysis aims to unravel the dynamics and conditions under which GlobalG.A.P. can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable development of the food sector in the South. Food security, food safety and environmental sustainability are essential preconditions for the well-being of societies worldwide. The fulfilment of these conditions is particularly challenging for the global South, whose constant struggle with poverty, hunger and environmental degradation has been aggravated by contemporary events, such as the food crisis and the global economic downturn. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that the number of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition rose to more than one billion in 2009, with women and children most seriously affected (FAO 2009). Global environmental challenges, in particular climate change, as well as pollution and water shortages, are expected to multiply threats to the provision of adequate amounts of nutritious and safe food (High Representative and European Commission to the European Council 2008). At the same time, hazardous environmental practices in agriculture also have negative health repercussions. Pesticide poisoning by farmers and rural workers, for instance, is a frequent phenomenon in developing countries, while legal provisions for workers’ health and safety are almost non-existent. In general, labour standards in agriculture tend to be extremely low. Private food governance promises to address these concerns on the basis of voluntary standards, corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and codes of conduct. GlobalG.A.P. is a pivotal private standard that targets issues of food safety, as well as environmental and labour concerns. Against this background, the chapter inquires into the potential of GlobalG.A.P. for fostering sustainability objectives in the South. Given its increasing prominence, GlobalG.A.P. can be a leading force in reversing certain trends with respect to sustainability and/or exacerbating others. The chapter also evaluates the legitimacy of GlobalG.A.P., both toward its stakeholders and the broader polity, in order to identify opportunities and constraints for a more participatory, transparent and accountable development of the food sector in the South. The chapter proceeds as follows. First, we provide a brief background on the origin of the GlobalG.A.P., lay out its instruments and governance structure, and explore changes that have occurred within the organization over time. Second, we evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative, both on its own terms and with respect to broader sustainability objectives and recognized international development standards. Third, we discuss existing criticism of the initiative and try to identify sources of potential shortcomings. We conclude by considering strategies for the improvement of the GlobalG.A.P. from the perspective of developing countries. © 2012 United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)."

Diversification of production and consumption habits to include a broader range of plant species, in particular those currently identified as 'underutilized', can contribute significantly to improved health and nutrition, livelihoods, household food security and ecological sustainability. In particular, these plant species offer enormous potential for contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in combating hidden hunger and offering medicinal and income generation options. One illustrative example of underutilized crop is Macrotyloma uniflorum (Horse gram) is an under harnessed and cheap legume crop, rich in protein. It has been identified as a potential food resource of the tropics by the National Academy of Science of USA. Horse gram provides 319 Kcal energy/100g, 58.71g carbohydrate/100g, 5.0 g fibre/100g and 234.4mg of calcium/100g and has high protein levels (21.59%) and even better iron contents ( 14.42mg /100g) as has been validated by nutrient analysis in our laboratory. Processing treatments like roasting and germination decreases the antinutrients (oxalic acid and trypsin) content in horse gram. Therefore, to utilize underutilized legume among population as it has an immense potential, a nutritious food is developed known as churma (traditional dish of Rajasthan). This is different from original recipe in vogue as it contains a non conventional food ""horse gram"". By evaluating the recipes through hedonic method it was found that variant A (incorporated with raw horse gram) named as Churma scored the highest for overall acceptability among all the variants. Moreover, variants has been found to be much better than standard recipe in terms of nutrients. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

FAO (2013) defines food security as a situation when 'all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life'. Despite of the increasing importance of food security and food politics, ethical discourse in the field has been scarce. Even more this is the case concerning the first world food security. This paper exploresthe three major challenges the first world hunger poses to ethics: (1) access to food; (2) local culture and food sovereignty; and (3) sustainability. These challenges are 'wicked problems' and require ethical theorising for discussing and finding the solutions. Through the discussion of these problems this paper shows that whereas traditional, distribution oriented theories of justice are too narrow in front of the aforementioned challenges, the multidimensional theory of justice offers a promising conceptual framework for approaching the wicked problems."

There is a dire need to utilize these underutilized grains of plant species as they can contribute appreciably towards the improvement in overall human nourishment, stable environmental services, fighting hunger and offering medicinal and income generation options. In this review, two grains, viz. gorgon nut and job’s tears have been discussed. Both of these grains possess antifungal, antibacterial and antioxidant activity and have high phytochemical content. Growth requirements of these grains are specific and distinct and their high nutritional content indicates their potential application as nutraceutical. The utilization of these species is limited because there is a lack of awareness, relevant capacity within the research community and the land they are grown on is increasingly under global and local pressures. Underutilized species have not attracted enough attention of policy makers because they cannot compete with major commodity crops, commanding larger economic interests.

Design: Develop a new integrated program area within a university by forging explicit linkages within a wide array of disciplines concerned with food systems and human health. Setting: The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Human Ecology, the Division of Nutrition, and the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture, and Development at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA. Interventions: Use food-based, system approaches to meet human nutrition goals. Current focus is on the provision of micronutrients (especially iron, vitamin A and iodine) for people globally. Results: A new program area 'Food Systems for Health' has been developed at Cornell University. The program fosters effective interdisciplinary research, teaching and extension activities directed towards sustainable improvements in human nutrition and health. Conclusions: The old paradigms of agriculture, human nutrition, and public health must be shifted from current linear approaches to integrated and interactive approaches if effective long-term, food-based solutions to micronutrient malnutrition are to be found.

Such claims encourage the further shift of public resources toward molecular sciences, globalized intellectual property rights, and relaxed biotechnology regulation. However, focusing on transgenic crops is a risky and inadequate response to socioeconomic and ecological challenges. The search for a universal, technological solution disregards the complex geographies of food production and trade. This article challenges claims that crop genetic engineering represents a new direction in agriculture, that transgenic crops have performed well, and that the regulatory approaches used in the United States or Europe are universally applicable. It outlines three geographies of difference that distinguish agriculture in the global North from farming in most of the global South. Those differences point to the need for more place-specific, multifaceted, and farmer-centered approaches to agricultural productivity and sustainability, approaches to which geographers have much to contribute.

The global food situation is redefined by many driving forces such as population growth, availability of arable lands, water resources, climate change and food availability, accessibility and loss. The combined effect of these factors has undeniably impacted global food production and security. This article reviews the key factors influencing global food insecurity and emphasises the need to adapt science-based technological innovations to address the issue. Although anticipated benefits of modern technologies suggest a level of food production that will sustain the global population, both political will and sufficient investments in modern agriculture are needed to alleviate the food crisis in developing countries. In this globalised era of the 21st century, many determinants of food security are trans-boundary and require multilateral agreements and actions for an effective solution.

In addition to advancing food security by eliminating hunger and malnutrition, soil resources must be managed regarding numerous other global needs through interdisciplinary collaborations. Some of which are to mitigate global warming; to improve quantity and quality of freshwater resources; to enhance biodiversity; to minimize desertification; serve as a repository of waste; an archive of human and planetary history; meet growing energy demands; develop strategies of sustainable management of urban ecosystems; alleviate poverty of agricultural communities as an engine of economic development; and fulfill aspirations of rapidly urbanizing and industrializing societies. In addition to food and ecosystem services, bio-industries (e.g., plastics, solvents, paints, adhesives, pharmaceuticals and chemicals) through plant-based compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, and oils) and energy plantations (bioethanol and biodiesel) can revolutionize agriculture. These diverse and complex demands on soil resources necessitate a shift in strategic thinking and conceptualizing sustainable management of soil resources in agroecosystems to provide all ecosystem services while also meeting the needs for food, feed, fiber, and fuel by developing multifunctional production systems. There is a strong need to broaden the scope of soil science to effectively address ever changing societal needs. To do this, soil scientists must rally with allied sciences including hydrology, climatology, geology, ecology, biology, physical sciences (chemistry, physics), and engineering. Use of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology can play an important role in addressing emerging global issues. Pursuit of sustainability, being a moral/ethical and political challenge, must be addressed in cooperation with economists and political scientists. Soil scientists must work in cooperation with industrial ecologists and urban planners toward sustainable development and management of soils in urban and industrial ecosystems. More than half of the worlds population (3.3 billion) live in towns and cities, and the number of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 5 billion by 2030. Thus, the study of urban soils for industrial use, human habitation, recreation, infrastructure forestry, and urban agriculture is a high priority. Soil scientists must nurture symbiotic/synergistic relations with numerous stake holders including land managers, energy companies and carbon traders, urban planners, waste disposal organizations, and conservators of natural resources. Trading of C credits in a trillion-dollar market by 2020 must be made accessible to land managers, especially the resource-poor farmers in developing countries.

Currently, international law is deficient in providing adequate protection of the rights of poor farmers and their communities as the legal instruments of Intellectual Property legislation are focussed more on the protection of commercial companies and entrepreneurs. PhytoTrade Africa is engaged in addressing the sustainable use and commercialisation of natural products produced by indigenous plants, especially trees of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa. Initially the market focus has been on wild-harvested naturally occurring resources using innovative approaches to protecting the Intellectual Property Rights of poor communities and the businesses they work with, including Patents, Trade Marks, and Geographical Indicators, with the intention of securing long term strategic market access and to be able to influence commercial strategy. The approach which has been developed is to work with indigenous communities and local companies and to help them to secure long-term access to these markets through the protection of their intellectual property rights. Experience to date indicates that, by enabling market opportunities for these local resources, significant livelihood options for otherwise marginalised farmers and producers can be facilitated. Partnerships between producers and the local-to-global cosmetic, food, beverage, herbal medicine and pharmaceutical industries are developed by carefully constructing commercial agreements with leaders in the relevant sector. Critically this involves the establishment of a strong and viable trade association that is forward thinking and market oriented. Through these partnerships it is possible to ensure long term relationships and supply agreements. Such agreements ensure that the target producers remain in the value chain.

South Asia, which has the poorest population in Asia is also affected by this process. Among the nations of South Asia, Sri Lanka has a relatively high degree of social welfare, although food security for its 20.1 million people is not achieved. This is due to the phenomenon of smallholder farming systems producing some 90% of the food required under marginal conditions in low fertile soils. The current problems of irregular climates, global warming and anthropogenic effects of conventional intensive cropping have added to the challenges facing the increase of in-country food production. As land for expansion of food crop cultivation is not available in Sri Lanka, short term measures are required for enhancing crop productivity to ensure food security within the next decade. The options available are breeding suitable crops or enhancing agronomic management of the food crop systems. As breeding programmes take time and could be expensive, the short term measures to increase food production would thus be improved agronomic management of the smallholder farming systems. A principal component of improved agronomic management of food crop systems is the building up of soil quality and its maintenance to ensure sustained productivity in the context of rising costs of inputs. The role of holistic agronomic practices such as green manures, crop rotations, and even agroforestry and their integration to enhance food productivity and maintain sustainability to ensure that Sri Lanka could achieve its targets of food security is presented in this review. © 2008, National Science Foundation.

The water needed to produce a nutritionally acceptable diet for one person is however 70 times as large as the amount needed for domestic water supply.

It is suggested that an additional 5 600 km3/yr of consumptive water use will be needed to produce an adequate amount of food by 2050 - i.e almost a doubling of today's consumptive use of 6800 km3/yr.

Diversity of kingdoms, species and genepools can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing conditions, and more diverse farming systems are also generally more resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security. Diversity can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the impact of pests and diseases. Diversity of diet, founded on diverse farming systems, delivers better nutrition and greater health, with additional benefits for human productivity and livelihoods. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.

The first written document on fish culture was published in China in 475 BC, and the first koi pond was constructed at the Japanese Imperial Palace grounds during 71-130 AD. In recent years, aquaculture has progressively played an important role in the provision of: animal protein and gourmet cuisines, job opportunities, and foreign currency for developing countries. Asian countries produce around 91 percent of the world's total aquaculture production. Among the top ten aquaculture-producing countries, nine are from Asia. The current global population consist of more than 6.5 billion individuals; over one billion of which face hunger problem. In the highly populated Asia-Pacific region with moderately high-productivity, 642 million people are still facing hunger. Being a proficient and potential source of animal protein, aquaculture will play an increasing and important role in solving the world food problem in the future. This paper discusses both the opportunities and constraints in the aquaculture industry, specifically in the AsiaPacific region, and its possible role in solving the current global food crisis. Strategies including promotion and adoption of traceability and HACCP systems for food safety, and marketing management for aquaculture products are also suggested. It is hoped that traditional administration of aquaculture management for survival, profit, as well as food safety will successfully match sustainability management to meet the urgent global need for food."

Until 1984, cattle were mainly used for dairying, but today there are many more suckling cows. The CAP at its beginning aimed at maximizing the production and at modernizing the farming methods, so as to secure the food supply. Two very specialized breeding types were supported for the production of milk and for that of meat, to the detriment of dual-purpose breeds, which then constituted still the majority of the cattle. Since the setting-up of quotas and the emergence of new concerns, e.g. those regarding the environment, the quality of the products, the maintenance of lands etc., the systems have become more diversified, without the previous models being modified. Now that new problems arise (hunger, climate...), those responsible for the agricultural policy, particularly in breeding and in Research-Development, should make their decisions concerning the choice of cattle types on the basis of the diversity of the environments and the preservation of the animals' grass-eating specificity and of the public benefits linked with the presence of grasslands.

Together, these criticisms stand as the foundation for many of the contemporary (if decentralized) US movements that work to construct a healthier and more sustainable food system.

We consider both his involvement in the public stage through his investment in a joint stock playing company and his management of natural resources – especially food and food-producing land – as commodities.

Such a new model of agriculture is presented by its supporters as a means to contribute to the elimination of poverty, as it intends to maximise the crop production. However, it does not take into consideration that policies fighting hunger: - need a more comprehensive approach; - must take into consideration socio-economic and environmental peculiarities, especially local needs and traditional knowledge and practices. Genetically modified technology goes against these basic requirements, as it is designed to suit multinational enterprises in the North. When drafting development policies, rich and poor countries must bear in mind that the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, to which 189 Nations committed, requires a coherent approach to empower the poor, especially women, and promote traditional knowledge of indigenous people and local communities, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability.

The world's food insecure population is estimated at 730 million in 2005 and 680 million in 2010, of which 200 million are in Africa, and 3.7 billion are at risk of hidden hunger. Agricultural sustainability is closely linked with availability and quality of water and soil. Water use for urban, industrial and agricultural use, respectively, was 20, 30 and 350 km3 yr-1 in 1900, and 440,1900 and 3400 km3 yr-1 in 2000. Population affected by water scarcity was 130 million in 1990, 436 million in 1995 and projected to be 800 million in 2025 and 3950 million in 2050. Per capita agricultural land availability in 1990 and 2025, respectively, is estimated at 0.05 and 0.03 ha in Egypt, 0.10 and 0.04 ha in Kenya, 0.33 and 0.05 ha in Tanzania, 0.35 and 0.07 ha in Pakistan, 0.20 and 0.12 ha in India, 0.09 and 0.05 ha in Bangladesh, 0.32 and 0.08 ha in Indonesia, 0.32 and 0.06 ha in China and 0.33 and 0.08 ha in the Philippines. Land scarcity is exacerbated by the severe problem of soil degradation in developing countries. Global land area affected by degradation is estimated by ISRIC at 1094 Mha by water erosion, 548 Mha by wind erosion, 240 Mha by chemical and 83 Mha by physical processes. Of these, percentage of degraded areas occurring in developing countries is 77 for water erosion, 83 for wind erosion, 89 for chemical degradation and 53 for physical degradation. Soil degradation depletes the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool leading to emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Compared with 270 ± 30 Pg C emitted into the atmosphere through fossil fuel combustion, 136 ± 55 Pg were contributed through terrestrial ecosystems, of which 78 ± 12 Pg came through depletion of the SOC pool. Sustainable horticultural practices, similar to grain crops, include mulching with crop residues and synthetic materials, growing cover crops, water harvesting, and conservation tillage or even no-till farming. The objective is to enhance soil quality and alleviate soil and environmental constraints to increasing production. Sustainable management of natural resources must be based on enhancing productivity per unit area; time and energy input; maintaining a positive trend in productivity over time; creating SOC sink capacity of natural and managed ecosystems; reducing risks of non-point source pollution and sedimentation; and making managed ecosystems a solution to environmental problems. Relevant indices of sustainable horticulture and resource management include soil quality and resilience and factors affecting them, and temporal changes in productivity, and use efficiency of non-renewable or input of limited resources."

Our perspective is that it is critical to pursue a comprehensive definition of sustainability in order to set sustainable agriculture priorities and ensure that sustainable agriculture takes a path that does not reproduce problems of conventional agriculture. In this paper we briefly review some popular definitions of sustainable agriculture and find that their focus is primarily on farm-level resource conservation and profitability as the main components of sustainability. Others have challenged this approach for either not examining the social aspects of sustainability or for containing an implicit assumption that working on the environmental, production, and microeconomic aspects of sustainability will automatically take care of its social aspects. We propose an expanded conceptualization of sustainability—one that focuses on the entire food and agriculture system at a global level and includes not only environmental soundness and economic viability, but social equity as well.

Here, we analyze how different combinations of technological measures and behavioral changes could contribute to achieving a set of sustainability objectives, taking into account the interlinkages between them. The objectives include eradicating hunger, providing universal access to modern energy, preventing dangerous climate change, conserving biodiversity and controlling air pollution. The analysis identifies different pathways that achieve these objectives simultaneously, but they all require substantial transformations in the energy and food systems, that go far beyond historic progress and currently formulated policies. The analysis also shows synergies and trade-offs between achieving the different objectives, concluding that achieving them requires a comprehensive approach. The scenario analysis does not point at a fundamental trade-off between the objectives related to poverty eradication and those related to environmental sustainability.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) are leading a new international initiative on biodiversity for food and nutrition under the umbrella of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The overall aim is to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity in programmes contributing to food security and human nutrition, and to thereby raise awareness of the importance of this link for sustainable development. Further research is needed to increase the evidence base by filling our knowledge gaps with better inventories and more data on composition and consumption. If nutrient analysis and data dissemination of the various food species and intra-species diversity are systematically undertaken, national information systems for food and agriculture will be strengthened and can be used to form the basis for priority setting and national policy making. For nutrition, this will mean introducing more compositional data on biodiversity in national food composition databases and tables; developing and using dietary assessment instruments that capture food intake at the species and variety/breed level; and allowing food labelling that encourages awareness of food plant varieties and food animal subspecies. Nutrition and biodiversity feature directly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and ensure environmental sustainability. In combination, a nutrition and biodiversity initiative provides the very foundation for achieving these MDGs. © 2006."

In posing the problem as a moral dilemma between feeding people and saving nature, light and dark green value theories are made to appear in stark contrast, with the former prescribing the delivery of food aid to relieve hunger-related suffering, and the latter rejecting that call. This supposed dilemma between feeding people and saving nature is a false one. The real problem is a moral elitism on the part of developed countries where an insidious form of selfishness overemphasizes the role of population and obscures the roles of highly variable rates of consumption upon current environmental ills. An examination of the exemplary case of food politics shows that the exaggerated differences in policy implications of these two value theories can be diminished and that there is potential for common cause."

Knowing that food production, national and local food security, and equity in access to adequate nutrition are important is only the first step. Educating today's students to become motivated researchers, effective communicators, and agents of change in future systems is a larger challenge. The agroecology MSc program in Norway is one example of current educational initiatives that are addressing the production, economic, environmental, and social dimensions of farming and food systems in the region. Using an action learning and whole systems approach, we have built on our prior experience of intensive courses to develop one 8-week module focused on farming systems and a second 8-week module on food systems. In each case, an experiential learning strategy is used, with students spending time on farms and in communities, talking with key players who have different roles in the system. After two additional semesters of courses in specific areas of interest, each student completes a thesis project dealing with some aspect of agroecology and sustainability of food systems. Twelve examples are included here to illustrate the range of topics of recent MSc thesis research. Quotes from students who have completed the program are provided as testimonies to success. We conclude that integrating teaching and research has been highly effective in preparing agroecologists to deal with the complexity and uncertainty in dealing with food systems and nutrition in the future. © 2008 by The Haworth Press."

Using the case of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, it is argued that the steady erosion of the FAO's leadership and influence comes from tensions within the organization about how to respond to the world food problem. The accommodation of the tensions between a response that emphasizes economic growth and increasing agricultural productivity and that of a human right to food have marked the organization's history and ultimately constructed it as ineffectual and failing to effectively address world hunger. In examining the responses to the two major world food crises of the last thirty years, it is found that the proximate causes are similar as are the responses. This indicates that the dominant discourse of economic growth and productivity has not been successful in building a socially just and sustainable world food system. The world's people remain as vulnerable to food price shocks now as they were over thirty years ago."

However, being a temperate crop, potato is exposed to various environmental stresses, including extended periods of drought and heat. The majority of potato genomics, transcriptomics, and transgenics studies concentrate on the characterization of molecular mechanisms governing cold hardiness of tubers and response and tolerance mechanisms against diseases. Likewise, potato breeding studies focus on increasing the yield, extending the postharvest storage, and developing cultivars that withstand biotic stresses.

The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences), regional and national nutrition science and food technology organizations have concern about the leadership capacity available and required in what are rapidly changing and increasingly demanding circumstances. These include persistent poverty and hunger, climate change which threatens the sustainability of food production and fragile financial systems which are making food less affordable for many.

Three major challenges threaten current and future efforts to overcome food insecurity and malnutrition: climate and global environmental change and the consequent loss of ecosystems' services, the growing use of food crops as a source of fuel and the food and financial crises. This paper reviews and analyses the current and projected effects of climate change and bioenergy on nutrition and proposes policy recommendations to address these challenges. The first section of the review lays out the public health and socio-economic consequences of malnutrition and explores causes and costs. The paper then analyses the implications of climate and global environmental change and biofuel production for food security and nutrition, addressing strategies for adaptation and mitigation. This analysis includes a number of important socio-economic factors, besides climate change and biofuel production, that are currently impacting food and nutrition security, and that will likely contribute to future effects.

The food security directive focuses predominantly on ensuring the world is producing and consuming enough calories in bulk to reduce hunger and safeguard survival, as opposed to a goal that includes nutrition for well-being and development. To advance the dialogue, it is necessary to consider the ethical questions that swirl around integrating nutrition into the food security paradigm. The health, environmental, economic, and societal costs will be substantial if we do not change our course of action when it comes to feeding the world.

Moreover, there are growing doubts as to the long-term sustainability of many existing food production systems, including capture fisheries and aquaculture, to meet the future increasing global demands. Of the different agricultural food production systems, aquaculture (the farming of aquatic animals and plants) is widely viewed as an important weapon in the global fight against malnutrition and poverty, particularly within developing countries where over 93% of global production is currently produced, providing in most instances an affordable and a much needed source of high quality animal protein, lipids, and other essential nutrients. The current article compares for the first time the development and growth of the aquaculture sector and capture fisheries by analyzing production by mean trophic level. Whereas marine capture fisheries have been feeding the world on high trophic level carnivorous fish species since mankind has been fishing the oceans, aquaculture production within developing countries has focused, by and large, on the production of lower trophic level species. However, like capture fisheries, aquaculture focus within economically developed countries has been essentially on the culture of high value-, high trophic level-carnivorous species. The long term sustainability of these production systems is questionable unless the industry can reduce its dependence upon capture fisheries for sourcing raw materials for feed formulation and seed inputs. In line with above, the article calls for the urgent need for all countries to adopt and adhere to the principles and guidelines for responsible aquaculture of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The idea of agricultural sustainability centers on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, and that lead to improvements in food productivity. Here we show the extent to which 286 recent interventions in 57 poor countries covering 37 M ha (3% of the cultivated area in developing countries) have increased productivity on 12.6 M farms while improving the supply of critical environmental services. The average crop yield increase was 79% (geometric mean 64%). All crops showed water use efficiency gains, with the highest improvement in rainfed crops. Potential carbon sequestered amounted to an average of 0.351C ha-1 y -1.

However around one out of four ART users fail to achieve optimal adherence, risking drug resistance and negative treatment outcomes. A high demand for 2nd line treatments (currently ten times more expensive than 1st line ART) undermines the sustainability of African ART programs. There is an urgent need to identify context-specific constraints to adherence and implement interventions to address them. We used rapid appraisals (involving mainly qualitative methods) to find out why and when people do not adhere to ART in Uganda, Tanzania and Botswana. Multidisciplinary teams of researchers and local health professionals conducted the studies, involving a total of 54 semi-structured interviews with health workers, 73 semi-structured interviews with ARTusers and other key informants, 34 focus group discussions, and 218 exit interviews with ART users. All the facilities studied in Botswana, Tanzania and Uganda provide ARVs free of charge, but ART users report other related costs (e.g. transport expenditures, registration and user fees at the private health facilities, and lost wages due to long waiting times) as main obstacles to optimal adherence. Side effects and hunger in the initial treatment phase are an added concern. We further found that ART users find it hard to take their drugs when they are among people to whom they have not disclosed their HIV status, such as co-workers and friends. The research teams recommend that (i) health care workers inform patients better about adverse effects; (ii) ART programmes provide transport and food support to patients who are too poor to pay; (iii) recurrent costs to users be reduced by providing three-months, rather than the one-month refills once optimal adherence levels have been achieved; and (iv) pharmacists play an important role in this follow-up care. © 2007 Taylor & Francis."

Nutritional deficiencies (e.g. Iron, zinc, vitamin A) account for almost two-thirds of the childhood death worldwide. Most of those afflicted are dependent on staple crops for their sustenance. Importantly, these crops can be enriched (i.e. 'biofortified') with micronutrients using plant breeding and/ or transgenic strategies, because micronutrient enrichment traits exist within their genomes that can to used for substantially increasing micronutrient levels in these foods without negatively impacting crop productivity. Furthermore, 'proof of concept' studies have been published using transgenic approaches to biofortify staple crops (e.g. high β-carotene 'golden rice' grain, high ferritin-Fe rice grain, etc). In addition, micronutrient element enrichment of seeds can increase crop yields when sowed to micronutrient-poor soils, assuring their adoption by farmers. Bioavailability issues must be addressed when employing plant breeding and/or transgenic approaches to reduce micronutrient malnutrition. Enhancing substances (e.g. ascorbic acid, S-containing amino acids, etc) that promote micronutrient bioavailability or decreasing antinutrient substances (e.g. phytate, polyphenolics, etc) that inhibit micronutrient bioavailability, are both options that could be pursued, but the latter approach should be used with caution. The world's agricultural community should adopt plant breeding and other genetic technologies to improve human health, and the world's nutrition and health communities should support these efforts.

The challenge of gender gaps in agriculture has persisted despite efforts of gender mainstreaming. This paper assesses gender based impacts of conservation agriculture (CA) basins among smallholder farmers under the Conservation Agriculture Programme (CAP) in Zambia. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to collect data. Quantitative data was analysed mainly by descriptive statistics and qualitative data by thematic and content analysis. Results indicated that women and children experienced reduction in labour with respect to clearing of fields before tillage and during weeding where herbicides were used correctly. Improvement in household food security was also reported. Digging of CA basins was labour intensive and the chaka hoe was heavy for women. Labour requirement for women and children was more than for men during hand weeding. Herbicides have increased labour requirements for men because they are predominantly involved in spraying. Women needed to reduce their labour during weeding but feared that the use of herbicides would increase food insecurity during hunger peak period. This was because the use of herbicides is inconsistent with the practice of mixed cropping and selection of valuable wild vegetables that were important for food security. Results suggest that usage of herbicide such as atrazine could have health concerns that may affect women more than men. Use of herbicides raises questions as to what extent CA is environmentally sustainable. Interventions in CA need to be both gender sensitive and minimise tradeoffs between health concerns, socio-economic benefits and environmental sustainability. © Some rights reserved / Creative Commons license."

Agriculture plays an important part in their livelihoods. Rural households play a central role in realizing policy objectives. Production decisions at farm household level determine the current availability of agricultural produce (food security objectives; Roetter and Van Keulen 2007), as well as future production potentials (sustainability objectives; Verhagen et al. 2007). The majority of the poor are furthermore located in the rural areas of developing countries. Rural households are, thus, also key to poverty reduction policies. Farm households, however, do not live of farming alone. Parallel to the developments in agricultural science, the view on rural households has changed in the past decades. Analyses of single production systems have given way to a view on rural households as diversified enterprises. Rural household enterprises are not limited to the agricultural sector. Non-farm activities play an important role in income of these households all across the world, even in regions commonly thought of as subsistenceoriented, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In a rare worldwide comparison of the importance of non-farm income in developing countries, Africa ranked first with 42% of total rural income, followed by Latin America (40%) and Asia (32%) (Reardon et al. 1998). Rural areas play a prime role in two of the Millennium Development Goals: reducing poverty and hunger and ensuring environmental sustainability. The omnipresence of non-farm income in rural areas implies that any policy aimed at realizing these two Millennium Goals needs to look beyond households' agricultural activities. Non-farm activities play a prime role, directly by contributing significantly to household income and indirectly by shaping agricultural activities with implications for sustainability. However, the effect can be positive or negative. Pressure on natural resources may be reduced when households have alternative sources of income (Bahamondes 2003). Non-farm income may also (partially) be invested in sustainable agricultural practices. Soil nutrient mining is a key issue in the African context (see Verhagen et al. 2007). Inorganic fertilizers are an important source of nutrients. These fertilizers require cash which may be generated by non-farm activities. Nonfarm activities would then contribute to sustainability. In the Asian context, excessive use of pesticides and herbicides is a prime concern (see Verhagen et al. 2007).

To this end, we develop an empirical model that can be used in Monte Carlo simulations to study the dynamics of the underlying problem. Our model's parameters are derived from a data set provided by a large food bank and food rescue organization in north central Colorado. We find that food supply is a non-parametric heavy-tailed process that is well modeled with an extreme value peaks over threshold model. Although the underlying process is stochastic, the basic approach of food rescue and redistribution to meet hunger demand appears to be feasible. The ultimate sustainability of this model is intimately tied to the rate at which food expires and hence the ability to preserve and quickly transport and redistribute food. The cost of the redistribution is related to the number and density of participating suppliers. The results show that costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional donors to participate. With sufficient funding and manpower, a significant amount of food can be rescued from the waste stream and used to feed the hungry. © 2013 Phillips et al."

Engineers and educators, as problem solvers should be addressing these issues and challenges in sustainable ways. They have an enormous opportunity to help create a more sustainable world. Technology problems interconnecting sustainability challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, environmental pollution, economic and social instability are becoming increasingly major concerns for mankind. However, the engineers and scientists have failed on large extend to fully address the sustainability issues. It was also found that engineering graduates do not possess necessary skills to tackle sustainability related problems. Engineering practice and education are changing as social expectations and conditions for engineering practice change too. Students have the responsibility and opportunity to continue improving our life while reducing or even reversing the negative impacts that our industrial society is having on the environment. Current engineering curricula are not equipping them to properly deal with these challenges due to little integration of sustainable and green design strategies and practice. Transforming higher education curricula for sustainable development is a tough challenge, dealing with the complexness of sustainability concepts and integration into engineering education. Teaching students the sustainability principles and equipping them with necessary tools help them to make better choices on materials and energy use, or design. These concepts and methods are still relatively new to engineering curriculum and are not an established practice for most of such programs. Meanwhile, today's students have a strong desire to improve the world through their work, and sustainability connects with these interest and motivations. However, students' hunger for knowledge often outstrips what is available in their courses and the experiences of their professors. Furthermore, to make sustainable design compelling to a wider base of engineering students, we need to craft sustainable design in terms of mainstream design problems that are important, cutting-edge, and achievable. Then we need to help them how to effectively deal with environmental and societal needs and constraints as part of their core design process. The paper highlights the process required for embedding sustainability and green design into our programs, curriculum design, implementation and impediments to surmount for sustainability and green design in engineering education. This was done through a project-based approach, developing three new courses and appropriate changes in a number of existing courses. The skill requirements were studied and finally the list of subjects, topics, teaching and learning methods are identified and discussed in this paper. Copyright © 2014 by ASME."

Due to their link with local cultural experiences, tasting local food and beverages has been found to not only appease hunger but also serve as one of the unique and original attractions during a holiday. The promotion of local and regional food will not only elevate the tourism industry but also contributes towards tourism sustainability as it leads to preservation of culinary heritage as well as adding value to a destination's authenticity (du Rand and Heath, 2006). There is a need to use food unique to a destination as an effective marketing tool and at the same time take into account how to develop food as part of a cultural tourism product for a destination in a sustainable way. The use of this kind of food can be effectively incorporated in the tourism marketing of a destination by taking into account aspects such as: (1) factors that influence tourists or travellers to experience local food and beverages on trips and holidays, (2) satisfying tourists' palette without compromising its original state, (3) developing a clear and consistent 'food identity', and (4) the issue of preserving the local distinctiveness valued by tourists especially in the face of globalization pressures. More work appears to be in need with regard to the potentials of indigenous food in elevating the tourism industry. The purpose of this paper is to assess the viability and potentiality of indigenous food as an effective marketing or promotion tool for a destination's cultural tourism development. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group."

Starting from the present and upcoming changes in animal husbandry for the production of food of animal origin, the future role of veterinary medicine is as intensively explained as the need to transform the task of veterinary medicine from the traditional healing of disease into prevention and the implementation of a ""One-health-concept"", which means: animal health and animal welfare as entity for promoting the health and well being of people. In the then following, animal hygiene as one of the major tools to achieve and maintain the sustainability of animal husbandry by developing husbandry systems that use animal health- and welfare-oriented production practices and protect the environment by intelligent waste and emission management programmes is described in detail. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2009.

Hunger and undernutrition can be eliminated sustainably by 2025. The experiences of successful countries in substantially reducing hunger and undernutrition suggest that it is realistic to strive for this goal by accelerating the pace of progress. But to achieve this goal, governments and donors must devote sufficient resources and implement appropriate policies and investments. Discussions of a post-2015 development agenda, including a set of Sustainable Development Goals, which will advance what began with the MDGs are now well underway. Environmental sustainability is certainly integral to the post-2015 agenda, but it should be pursued in ways that do not undermine the food and nutrition security and well-being of poor and hungry people.

Supporters point to the increased food supplies produced with the new practices, but detractors argue that the new technologies are environmentally destructive, unsustainable, and socially inequitable. This paper explores the origins of high yielding agriculture in order better to understand how the arguments over sustainability and equity originated. The Rockefeller Foundation was an important agency in promoting the development of the new agricultural science. Its programs in Mexico and India, initiated in 1941 and 1956, were key building blocks in creating high yielding agricultural practices. The Foundation scientists saw rapid population growth as the main source of hunger and communist subversion. In order to alleviate hunger and instability, they created a strategy of agricultural development based on increased yields but paid no attention to the problem of distribution of harvested food. Sustainability was not recognized as a problem at the time Foundation scientists began their work. Indeed the technical successes of their programs prompted the development of concerns about sustainability. Equity of distribution was brought to the attention of the Foundation before it began its work, but the scientists paid no attention to the issue. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

Modern families are busier than ever, juggling hectic schedules that send them to fast-food restaurant drive-through windows and to grocery stores crowded with pre-processed and ready-to-eat foods. With parents frequently working during the daytime, efficient food preparation in the evenings has become the number one priority in kitchens across the country. This trend began during the post-World War II years, which heralded the arrival of ""fast foods"" and innovative technological advancements that sought to simplify the cooking process. These products were marketed as quick and convenient alternatives that transformed the concept of cooking from a cultural activity and a means of bonding with one's family to a chore that should occupy as little time and energy as possible. Profiles from the Kitchen: What Great Cooks Have Taught Us about Ourselves and Our Food is Charles A. Baker-Clark's call to abandon the ""homogenization of food and dining experiences"" by encouraging us to reclaim knowledge of cooking and eating and reconnect with our ethnic, familial, and regional backgrounds. Baker-Clark profiles fifteen individuals who have shaped our experiences with food and who have gone beyond popular trends to promote cooking as a craft worth learning and sustaining. The cooks and food critics he writes about emphasize the appreciation of good cooking and the relationship of food to social justice, spirituality, and sustainability. Profiles from the Kitchen highlights prominent figures within the food industry, from nationally and internationally known individuals such as Paul and Julia Child, James Beard, and M.F.K.

Second, state-led agrarian reforms and co-ops increase access to land, markets, water, forests and pasture, which have reduced – but not eliminated – seasonal hunger.

While the MDGs have focused on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, the food crisis pushed the hungry over the one billion mark. There is thus a renewed focus on agricultural development, which pivots on the salience of industrial agriculture (as a supply source) in addressing food security. The World Bank's new 'agriculture for development' initiative seeks to improve small-farmer productivity with new inputs, and their incorporation into global markets via value-chains originating in industrial agriculture. An alternative claim, originating in 'food sovereignty' politics, demanding small-farmer rights to develop bio-regionally specific agro-ecological methods and provision for local, rather than global, markets, resonates in the IAASTD report, which implies agribusiness as usual 'is no longer an option'. The basic divide is over whether agriculture is a servant of economic growth, or should be developed as a foundational source of social and ecological sustainability.

The extent of the rainfed area of about 223 million hectares and the biophysical attributes are described. They have been variously referred to inter alia as fragile, marginal, dry, waste, problem, threatened, range, less favoured, low potential lands, forests and woodlands, including lowlands and uplands. Of these, the terms less favoured areas (LFAs), and low or high potential are quite widely used. The LFAs are characterised by four key features: i) very variable biophysical elements, notably poor soil quality, rainfall, length of growing season and dry periods, ii) extreme poverty and very poor people who continuously face hunger and vulnerability, iii) presence of large populations of ruminant animals (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep), and iv) have had minimum development attention and an unfinished wanting agenda. The rainfed humid/sub-humid areas found mainly in South East Asia (99 million ha), and arid/semi-arid tropical systems found in South Asia (116 million ha) are priority agro-ecological zones (AEZs). In India for example, the ecosystem occupies 68% of the total cultivated area and supports 40% of the human and 65% of the livestock populations. The area also produces 4% of food requirements. The biophysical and typical household characteristics, agricultural diversification, patterns of mixed farming and cropping systems are also described. Concerning animals, their role and economic importance, relevance of ownership, nomadic movements, and more importantly their potential value as the entry point for the development of LFAs is discussed. Two examples of demonstrated success concern increasing buffalo production for milk and their expanded use in semi-arid AEZs in India, and the integration of cattle and goats with oil palm in Malaysia. Revitalised development of the LFAs is justified by the demand for agricultural land to meet human needs e.g. housing, recreation and industrialisation; use of arable land to expand crop production to ceiling levels; increasing and very high animal densities; increased urbanisation and pressure on the use of available land; growing environmental concerns of very intensive crop production e.g. acidification and salinisation with rice cultivation; and human health risks due to expanding peri-urban poultry and pig production. The strategies for promoting productivity growth will require concerted R and D on improved use of LFAs, application of systems perspectives for technology delivery, increased investments, a policy framework and improved farmer-researcher-extension linkages. These challenges and their resolution in rainfed areas can forcefully impact on increased productivity, improved livelihoods and human welfare, and environmental sustainability in the future."

Water has become scarce due to a score of internal and external factors including the growing demand for water resources by the upstream countries, expansion of the irrigated areas to ease food insecurity, and the poor condition of irrigation and drainage networks. To cope with environmental consequences and regional water challenges, it is vital to look for pathways of improved integrated water resource management, higher water use efficiencies, and reducing overall water use. A combination of value chain and water footprint analyses of the dominant crop, cotton, was applied to assess water use in different sectors of the Uzbekistan economy and to seek water saving and improved water management and efficiency options. The findings show that reduction in water use could be achieved by diversifying the economy and moving from water intensive agricultural production to less water consuming industrial sectors by introducing water saving irrigation technologies and by raising awareness of the population about the real value of water. The combined findings of the economic based value chain analysis and ecologically oriented water footprint analysis gave an added value for better informed decision-making to reach land, water, and ecosystem sustainability and to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals of eradicating poverty and hunger and achieving food and water security.

We support recent calls for environmental epidemiologists to play a more active role in furthering the global agenda for sustainability, environmental health and equity. We further suggest that the discipline of environmental epidemiology, as well as relevant funding agencies, broaden their focus to include rigorous research on the upstream, larger-scale societal factors that contribute to inequitable patterns of exposure and health outcomes. By widening the scope of our vision and increasing the strength and breadth of the evidence base about how poverty and environment together affect health, we can better participate in efforts to promote social justice and responsible use and protection of the environment, and thus reduce health inequities.

These beliefs influence policy, project development and implementation, and if wrong, may have far-reaching consequences for the success and sustainability of interventions. This study examines five beliefs about cassava and discusses consequences for interventions targeting cassava. From 2004 to 2006, 120 detailed farm surveys were carried out with smallholder farmers in 6 sites in central/eastern Uganda and western Kenya, whereby households were categorised in three wealth categories by local key informants. Through structured interviews and field visits, details on the importance of cassava, socio-economic indicators, food security, crop management and labour aspects were obtained. Our results show that cassava does ensure food security, but that the other beliefs are either myths or half truths. Besides supplying 27-41% of starchy staple food consumption, cassava also provided significant income (84 US$ yr -1), similar to that of maize (90 US$ yr-1). It is too simplistic to classify cassava as a 'poor man's crop' as in Uganda wealthier households marketed more (+16%), but in Kenya consumed less (-11%) cassava than poorer farmers. Cassava is not predominantly intercropped (30% of acreage in Uganda and 51% in Kenya), farmers do use inputs on cassava (36% of the households hire labour) and total labour requirements (287 mandays ha -1) were higher than for most crops. Contrary to expectations, we conclude that increasing cassava production will not improve food security - unless a disease epidemic is present - but instead will improve the scope for commercialisation of cassava. To ensure that projects designed to enhance cassava production benefit poor and/or labour deficit households, specific provisions are needed, including development of labour saving technologies. © 2009 INRA, EDP Sciences."

With regard to food and food systems, memes often work against measures to enhance the sustainability and health benefits of consumer food choices, as well as global food policy. One meme that operates within environmental and human rights discourse is that increased production, distribution and consumption of grain is the primary solution to global hunger. However, while easily stored, grain is nutritionally insufficient if over-dominant in the diet. Thus, over-dependence on grain may exacerbate malnutrition in less developed countries (LDCs), while leading to obesity in wealthy nations. Moreover, efforts to radically alter the nutritional content of grains have yet to succeed and increased production has displaced more nutritional staples in LDCs, has caused grain prices to dramatically fluctuate, and has relegated the vast bulk of production to multi-national corporations and their contractors. © 2012 IEEE."

A large number of the urban populace has not been able to provide the food need of their family. Due to urban expansion, there is limited or no land for subsistence farming. The few that have the opportunity withdrew due to pilfering and competing time for office work, home and the farm. In order to deal with the crisis, civil servants formed cooperative societies which engaged in the bulk purchase of food items for the co-operators. The bill of food items purchased serves as loans which were deducted from their salaries. The study examines the effectiveness of cooperative societies in ensuring household food security and sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo state. A total of 180 civil servants were randomly selected and interviewed for the study. Findings show that majority 48.33% of the respondents patronize the consumer cooperative societies monthly to purchase the food need of the family, while 32.78% patronize the societies quarterly. The most important reason for patronizing being getting cheaper food prices than the market price and the ease of payment. Some at the end of the month, after all deductions made from their salaries, rarely have something to take home but believe in a Yoruba adage which says 'Tebi bati kuro ninu ise, ise buse ' literarily meaning that when hunger is out of poverty, then poverty is drastically reduced. Result of the probit model reveals a significant relationship between consumers' cooperatives and household food security, a positive significant relationship between educational status, income and food security.

To understand what actions are needed to expand adaptive capacity to climate change and its consequences for food security, it is useful to learn from existing agricultural practices in semi-arid areas that exploit positive opportunities of rainfall variability. To determine how residents attain food self-sufficiency based on rain-fed maize farming in a semi-arid region that receives an average annual precipitation of 400. mm, we carried out a detailed, interdisciplinary study of the agricultural system in Massingir, Mozambique from 2006 to 2010. We found that some people produced enough maize when rainfall conditions were favorable to sustain the staple food needs of a household for 2-3. years, buffering the negative effects of subsequent poor cropping seasons and avoiding seasonal hunger periods. To maximize production people employed a variety of practices including: planting after every rainfall event throughout the rainy season, up to six times in one season on as large an area as possible, as much as 18. ha per household, and employing labor/oxen exchange arrangements. We explored the role of these practices as key factors that determined total food production and variability among households. Although only 35% of planting events were successful, total seed sown represented only 8.5% of harvest over 15. years. Labor/oxen exchange arrangements allowed disadvantaged households to produce twice as much as without collaboration. Recent invasion of the large grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus), a devastating post-harvest storage insect pest, represents a major new threat to the sustainability of the agricultural system and to food security that could worsen with climate change. Our results suggest that policies aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate change could be improved through a deeper understanding of existing practices. © 2013."

Water is essential for food production and sanitation - key factors in poverty reduction. At the same time, it is increasingly difficult to ensure clean water to maintain ecosystem services. The challenge is to find ways of managing water in order to meet both these goals in a balanced way. This water-food-environment dilemma is exceedingly clear in the coastal zone because of increasing urban demands for water, with agriculture remaining an important component of rural livelihoods, and the dependence on water by some of the most valuable ecosystems of the world that are essential for the well-being of society. Driving forces affecting this water-food-environment nexus are increases in population and income and changing dietary patterns, which highly influence food production and water-use patterns. In response, there have been many positive trends such as overall better nutrition, an increase in overall food production and water productivity, and increased global trade in food products, thus helping in food distribution. On the other hand, there are some very disturbing trends. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa still fall below the level required to 'lead a healthy and reproductive life' and water could be much better used for providing food security. An increased number of water bodies are becoming depleted, polluted and non-productive, negatively affecting both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Coastal zones are particularly vulnerable as they are susceptible to rapid changes both from within the area and from outside - shock events like tsunamis plus consistent pressure from upstream water development and use. Coastal zones bear the brunt of upstream water development, reduced flows and pollution loads, yet river basin water management has been concentrated in upstream areas and very often the coastal zone is neglected or considered separately. Thus, in order to achieve and maintain healthy coastal zones, agricultural water management has to be able to respond to rapid changes from within coastal zones to maintain a balance of food, livelihood and environmental interests, and coastal zone interests must be firmly represented in overall river basin management. © CAB International 2006."

These predominantly small-scale farmers face many challenges, including food insecurity, rising poverty, and natural resource degradation. To increase the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of their farms, they need greater access to affordable yield-enhancing inputs, including well-adapted seeds and new methods for integrated soil fertility management, as well as to output markets where they can convert surplus production into cash. To address these needs, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation established the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). AGRA is now African led and is working within the context of the comprehensive agricultural development program established by Africa's leaders.

Malnutrition does not always imply hunger or famine and is manifest in many forms, ranging from hunger to obesity. Core factors leading to malnutrition include excessive intakes, insufficient food consumption, and inadequate utilization of nutrients provided by foods ingested. Undernutrition is a term that comprises stunting, underweight, wasting, and deficiency in essential vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients). As such, it is the category of malnutrition that represents nutrient deficits. The other form of malnutrition is associated with excessive energy and nutrient intakes (which may also be accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies or suboptimal intakes), leading to obesity and other diet-related noncommunicable diseases.

The earth holds about one billion pigs who deliver over 100 mmt of pork to people for consumption. Systems of pork production changed from a forest-based to pasture-based to dirt lots and finally into specially-designed buildings. The world pork industry is variable and complex not just in production methods but in economics and cultural value. A systematic analysis of pork industry sustainability was performed. Sustainable production methods are considered at three levels using three examples in this paper: production system, penning system and for a production practice. A sustainability matrix was provided for each example. In a comparison of indoor vs. outdoor systems, the food safety/zoonoses concerns make current outdoor systems unsustainable. The choice of keeping pregnant sows in group pens or individual crates is complex in that the outcome of a sustainability assessment leads to the conclusion that group penning is more sustainable in the EU and certain USA states, but the individual crate is currently more sustainable in other USA states, Asia and Latin America. A comparison of conventional physical castration with immunological castration shows that the less-common immunological castration method is more sustainable (for a number of reasons). This paper provides a method to assess the sustainability of production systems and practices that take into account the best available science, human perception and culture, animal welfare, the environment, food safety, worker health and safety, and economics (including the cost of production and solving world hunger). This tool can be used in countries and regions where the table values of a sustainability matrix change based on local conditions.

This article aims at reviewing the main potentials and challenges of this approach when dealing with ""undernourishment"" as a multifaceted concept in developing countries. Accordingly, 2 main issues of the concept which are ""food security"" and ""food safety"" are discussed in the context of both developed and developing countries to understand their different food policies' priorities. Next, the main potentials, challenges and tradeoffs of the organic approach are analyzed to understand whether the approach is capable to provide a secure or a safe food-production system which can meet the food policy priorities in developing countries. With respect to food security, the article concludes that conventional and biotechnological approaches still produce higher yields than organic agriculture. However, considering the many advantages of organic agriculture, it can in a long run, be more conducive than now to meet food security. Thus, conventional approaches to feed the hungers in developing countries.

This study was set out to investigate the sustainability of the satiating effect after regular consumption of breakfast meals with whole grain rye porridge or refined wheat bread. The study was randomized, cross-over and double-blind. Healthy subjects (n = 24) were randomly assigned to daily consumption of iso-caloric standardized breakfast meals with whole grain rye porridge or refined wheat bread for two 3-wk phases, separated by a wash out of 3-4. weeks. Each intervention phase had 3 scheduled visit days (days 1, 8 and 22) when appetite ratings (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) were registered for 24. h at standardized conditions. Orocecal transit time (salicylazosulfapyridine/sulfapyridine method) and breath hydrogen as an indicator of colonic fermentation were measured at day 8 of each 3-wk phase in a subgroup (n = 16). To investigate effects of breakfast on free-living food intake, 3-day weighed food diaries were self-registered during both intervention phases. Whole grain rye porridge breakfast resulted in higher ratings of satiety and lower hunger and desire to eat during 4. h post consumption compared to refined wheat bread breakfast (p < 0.001). This effect was sustained throughout the 3-wk study phases. Unlike previous studies, the effects did not persist into the afternoon (4-8. h). The orocecal transit times after consumption of both breakfasts were similar and in the range of 5-6. h. The rye porridge resulted in high levels of breath hydrogen 4-8. h after intake, showing extensive colonic fermentation. This was however not related to any changes in appetite during this time-period. There were no significant differences in self-reported macronutrient- and energy intake between diets. This study shows that the satiating effect of rye persists after repeated daily consumption for up to three weeks. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01117363. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

The main focus is on changing consumption patterns and the consequences for food security and for the pressure on natural resources. In this context, the question is raised as to how foresight work can reflect the mechanisms by which a transition towards more sustainable consumption can influence the sustainability of the production systems. The authors first analyze the main drivers of the past and future evolution of food systems and then the implications for foresight analysis. An attempt is made to identify specific issues and policies that should be further analyzed. In particular, future foresight will be challenged to incorporate the interactions between consumption and production more explicitly and to address four issues: (i) intra-national heterogeneity of diets and resulting nutritional outcomes, (ii) externalities resulting from the process of production, processing, and marketing along the product chain, (iii) competition between food and non-food uses of agricultural commodities and between agricultural and non-agricultural use of land and (iv) mechanisms by which food scarcity causes hunger and malnutrition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology."

From a macroeconomic perspective, the commodity projections are more optimistic than the previous years and the long run tendency shows an increasing demand for feedstock. However, the strong shifts of shocks and fluctuations (in terms of prices and volumes) are a concern to global food security, with the number of hungry people rising to nearly one billion. Agriculture is a main user of natural resources, and it has a strong link with rural societies and the environment. Forecasted impacts from climate change, limited productive endorsements and emerging rivals on crop production, such bio-energy, aggravate the panorama on food scarcity. In this context, it is a great challenge on farming and food systems to reduce global hunger and produce in sustainable ways adequate supplies for food, feed, and non-food uses. The main objective of this work is to question the sustainability of food and agriculture systems. It is particularly interesting to know its role and if it will be able to respond to a growing population with increasing food demand in a world where pressure on land, water and other natural resources are already evident, and, moreover, climate change will also condition and impact the outcome. Furthermore, a deeper focus will be set on developing countries, which are expected to emerge and take a leading role in the international arena. This short paper is structured as follows: Section I, ""Introduction"", describes the social situation regarding hunger, Section II, ""Global Context"", attempts to summarise the current scenario in the international trading scheme and present the emerging rivals for primary resources, and in Section III, ""Climate Change"", presents an overview of possible changes in the sector and future perspectives in the field. Finally, in Section IV, ""Conclusion"", the main conclusions are presented."

Globally, most farmers live in lesser-developed countries under limited-resource conditions of land, feed supplies, equipment, and capital. The promotion of commercial animal production enterprises may not be appropriate for such farms because it can subject farmers to considerable economic risk. Rather, use of limited numbers of large livestock, locally adapted breeds, or smaller livestock (e.g., ducks, goats, guinea pigs, and rabbits) may be more appropriate under subsistence, integrated farming systems. In this global context, a course in international animal agriculture has been taught for 15 yr to undergraduate and graduate students. The course consists of a review of traditional and potential livestock species well suited for impoverished families on small farms and methods to implement sustainable livestock projects, including feasibility, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation stages. To enhance student understanding, global food issues and challenges are illustrated with case studies. A term paper is also assigned for which students choose three suitable livestock species or local breeds that would be complementary on a small crop farm (< 5 ha). Daily dietary requirements of protein and energy per family member are calculated. Itemized enterprise budgets and production tables are prepared. Early in the course, the general consensus of students was that people who are malnourished and live in poverty have low personal ambition and motivation, and that their problems should be amenable to solution by application of American technology and expertise. The course modifies such attitudes and enhances a student's critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and communication skills. Course evaluations indicated that students believed that it is important to acquire some international knowledge and understanding when seeking a job, and that certain animal science courses should contain some international content. Students gain an understanding of global animal agriculture and an appreciation of the complexity of food production and hunger issues."

Urbanization has been underpinned by the rapid growth in the world economy and in the proportion of gross world product and of workers in industrial and service enterprises. Globally, agriculture has met the demands from this rapidly growing urban population, including food that is more energy-, land-, water-and greenhouse gas emission-intensive. But hundreds of millions of urban dwellers suffer under-nutrition. So the key issues with regard to agriculture and urbanization are whether the growing and changing demands for agricultural products from growing urban populations can be sustained while at the same time underpinning agricultural prosperity and reducing rural and urban poverty. To this are added the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience in agriculture and urban development to climate change impacts. The paper gives particular attention to low-and middle-income nations since these have more than three-quarters of the world's urban population and most of its largest cities and these include nations where issues of food security are most pressing. © 2010 The Royal Society."

Farmers can purchase subsidized policies that pay an indemnity when their production or revenue falls below a guaranteed level. Historically, the federal crop insurance program primarily has covered traditional farm program crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans. However, the crop insurance program has expanded in recent decades, and policies are available now for a wide range of commodities, including specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables. In 2009, specialty crop policies covered more than 7 million acres, which was roughly one-half to three-quarters of specialty crop area, depending on how total area is calculated. In total, crop insurance is available for over 80 specialty crops, making the program the primary financial safety net for specialty crop producers.The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Risk Management Agency (RMA) operates the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which is the funding mechanism for the program. Insurance policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies. The insurance companies' losses are reinsured by USDA, and their administrative and operating costs are reimbursed by the federal government. Federal crop insurance policies for specialty crops (and other crops as well) are generally either yield-based or revenue-based. For most yield-based policies, a producer can receive an indemnity if there is a yield loss relative to the farmer's ""normal"" (historical) yield. Insurable causes of loss include drought, excess precipitation, hail, frost, freeze, fire (if due to natural causes), and insects and disease. Revenue-based policies protect against crop revenue loss resulting from declines in yield, price, or both. Nursery crop producers can be protected against loss of an ""asset"" due to weather damage (but not price loss). Also relevant for specialty crop producers is whole-farm insurance, which protects against losses in whole farm revenue rather than just for an individual crop. An endorsement is available in some areas for protecting against loss due to quarantine. While additional policies have been introduced in the last 10 years, producers and some Members of Congress would like to enhance crop insurance for specialty crop producers. In the 112th Congress, several legislative proposals have been introduced. The Local Farms, Food, and Jobs Act of 2011 (H.R. 3286/S. 1773) would enhance whole farm insurance and insurance for organic crops. The Rural Economic Farm and Ranch Sustainability and Hunger (REFRESH) Act of 2011 (S. 1658 and H.R. 3111) would also enhance whole farm insurance. The Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 2011 (S. 1905) would support the development of new policies. In the 112th Congress, specialty crop provisions in these and other proposals have been included in the Senate-passed farm bill (S. 3240) and the House committee-passed farm bill (H.R. 6083). The bills require USDA to conduct more research on higher coverage levels for whole farm revenue insurance and study insurance for food safety and contamination-related losses. A provision would revise the value of crop insurance for all organic crops to reflect prices of organic (not conventional) crops. For crops not insurable with crop insurance, additional coverage would become available under the existing Noninsured Crop Assistance Program (NAP). Finally, a provision in S. 3240 would subsidize the purchase of existing private-sector index-based weather insurance, which protects against specific weather events and not actual loss. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Less visible, but all the more damaging, are the long-term effects of hunger that run through families through generations. Hunger passed from mother to child represents a ruinous inheritance. It marks a cycle of hunger that transcends generations, unless the cycle is broken. Food aid provided at crucial times in the lives of women and infants represents an investment for future. Thus, in contrast to former conceptions of food aid as an exclusively life-saving vehicle, modern aims of food aid also include preventing increases in the prevalence of malnutrition and asset depletion. Mass migration and food shortages have been responsible for most deaths following civil conflicts around the world. The most visible form of migration occurs when people cross international borders. The reasons for the flight of refugees and internally displaced persons are generally same; war, civil strife, and persecution. ""NUTRITIONAL GATEWAYS"": Finally, the importance of timely and sustained delivery of adequate food aid adequate in quality and quantity to people in dire need during the emergency is paramount. Food aid is the most direct means for conveying nutritional benefits: the time frame is often limited, sustainability is not an issue. However, in the case of drought victims, refugees or displaced people, the nutritional situation and the actions needed are more complex. In many situations people arrive are often in very bad state. While high prevalence of malnutrition is associated with inadequate food rations, in some situation malnutrition developed primarily because of the high incidence of diarrhoeal diseases. The synergism between high malnutrition and increased incidence of communicable diseases explains much of excess mortality seen in refugee and displaced persons."

Nearly six million of these are children under the age of five; that is one child’s death approximately every six seconds. Understanding how this still occurs amid the ever increasing social enlightenment of the 21st century—and under the auspices of a vigilant global developmental community—is one of the key challenges of our time. The science of food security aims to address such concerns. By understanding the multiplicity of the phenomenon, practitioners of global multilateral hegemony seek to shape appropriate policy to address these issues. The difficulty however is that the phenomenon is increasingly wrapped up inside an ever growing bundle of societal aspirations including inter-alia under-nutrition, poverty, sustainability, free trade, national self sufficiency, reducing female subjugation and so on. Any solutions therefore, involve fully understanding just what is indeed included, implied, understood or excluded within the food security catchall. Indeed, until such time as consensus can be found that adequately binds the phenomenon within a fixed delineated concept, current efforts to address the multitude of often divergent threads only serves to dilute efforts and confound attempts to once-and-for-all bring these unacceptable figures under control. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Agricultural practices will need to keep pace with the intensification of sustainable food production in order to face the challenge of feeding a world population estimated to reach about nine billion by 2050. Contemporary wheat breeding has increasingly focused on the future, culminating in the emergence of a global partnership for breeding new wheat varieties with resistance to rust pathogens.

However, the evidence surrounding the use of either cash or voucher transfer programmes in the humanitarian context and on nutritional outcomes is elusive. More evidence is needed not only to inform the global community of practice on best practices in humanitarian settings, but also to help strengthen national mitigation responses. Methods/Design: The Research for Food Assistance on Nutrition Impact Pakistan study (REFANI-P) sets out to evaluate the impact of three cash-based interventions on nutritional outcomes in children aged less than five years from poor and very poor households in Dadu District. This four-arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial is set among Action Against Hunger (ACF) programme villages in Dadu District, Sindh Province. Mothers are the target recipients of either seasonal unconditional cash transfers or fresh food vouchers. A comparison group receives 'standard care' provided by the ACF programme to which all groups have the same access. The primary outcomes are prevalence of wasting and mean weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) in children. Impact will be assessed at 6 months and at 1 year from baseline. Using a theory-based approach we will determine 'how' the different interventions work by looking at the processes involved and the impact pathways following the theory of change developed for this context. Quantitative and qualitative data are collected on morbidity, health seeking, hygiene and nutrition behaviours, dietary diversity, haemoglobin concentration, women's empowerment, household food security and expenditures and social capital. The direct and indirect costs of each intervention borne by the implementing organisation and their partners as well as by beneficiaries and their communities are also assessed. Discussion: The results of this trial will provide robust evidence to help increase knowledge about the predictability of how different modalities of cash-based transfer work best to reduce the risk of child wasting during a season where food insecurity is at its highest. Evidence on costing and cost-effectiveness will further aid decisions on choice of modality in terms of effectiveness and sustainability. Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10761532.

In contrast, institutions and lobbies concerned with hunger, poverty and environment, brought together at the 2003 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, treat population growth as a given, independent, variable. This paper gives a land resources viewpoint. It includes a case study of Malawi and cross-country statistical comparisons. Official estimates of the extent of spare land, cultivable but not presently cultivated, are challenged. It is concluded that in low-income, food-deficit countries population increase has reduced, in some areas nullified, advances in agricultural development. Following the 1994 UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, a set of ethically acceptable measures for reducing population growth received general acceptance. All concerned with poverty, hunger and environment should follow the policy road from Cairo to Johannesburg. If greater efforts are not made to reduce rates of population increase, the targets of the Millennium declaration will not be met, and the suffering which these cause will continue. Statements about agriculture, food security, poverty and sustainability should recognize that population is not an external variable but an integral part of development. © 2005 The Royal Geographical Society."

One of the humanity's significant achievements has been to produce adequate food for the largest growing population. However, the co-existence of chronic hunger and malnutrition with presence of adequate capacities to address it is one of the gravest paradoxes of our time. In one-third of African countries the average daily calorie intake remains below the recommended level of 2100 kcal. The need and importance for greater food sovereignty has emerged out of broader concerns over the negative impact of world's food system on food security and environmental sustainability. Adoption of the food sovereignty principles are essential to empower local communities to have greater control over their productive resources, use and sustain ecologically friendly means of production, and access local markets as well as nutritious and culturally accepted food. The majority of African farmers are smallholders. However, the existing trend of land grabbing in Africa seriously affects food sovereignty in an unprecedented level. Based on the secondary sources, this paper explores different dimensions of the complex relationship between food sovereignty and land grabbing in African countries. It also analyses the various aspects on how the ongoing process of land grabbing in Africa affects food sovereignty which in turn leads to food insecurity of millions. The introduction of intensive agricultural production, due to land grabbing often based on a transformation of complex farming systems for commercial purpose can seriously threaten biodiversity. There is a need to balance the local circumstance while favouring large scale agricultural projects. © 2014 by the authors."

Capra shows how focusing on a smaller problem (rising oil prices) gets policy makers into trouble because they fail to see its relationship to much larger issues: The price of food starts rising to match its market value as a potential fuel source, while, hunger and poverty increase throughout the world. Or, as mankind heats up the environment, temperate food producing areas turn into deserts, food prices rise and poverty and hunger increase. As the title of the article indicates, Capra shows how food, health and the environment are inextricably linked as the new facts of life in today's world. © The Center for Ecoliteracy."

These bold goals can be met in all parts of the world if nations follow through on their commitments to work together to meet them. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals offers the prospect of a more secure, just, and prosperous world for all. The UN Millennium Project was commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to develop a practical plan of action to meet the Millennium Development Goals. As an independent advisory body directed by Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, the UN Millennium Project submitted its recommendations to the UN Secretary General in January 2005. The core of the UN Millennium Project's work has been carried out by 10 thematic Task Forces comprising more than 250 experts from around the world, including scientists, development practitioners, parliamentarians, policymakers, and representatives from civil society, UN agencies, the World Bank, the IMF, and the private sector. This report lays out the recommendations of the UN Millennium Project Task Force on Hunger in seven major categories: political action; national policy reforms; increased agricultural productivity for food insecure farmers; improved nutrition for the chronically hungry; productive safety nets for the acutely hungry; improved rural incomes and markets; and restoration and conservation of natural resources essential for food security. The task force strongly endorses the Secretary General's call for a 21st Century African Green Revolution. These bold yet practical approaches will enable countries in every region of the world to halve world hunger by 2015. © 2005 United Nations Development Programme. All right reserved."

Biological resources are renewable resources, but they are being exploited at rates that exceed their sustainable yield. Human destruction of habitats, whether exploited for commercial or subsistence reasons, is the greatest threat. Genetic diversity is not evenly distributed over the globe; it is in fact concentrated in tropical and sub-tropical areas, where most developing countries are located. Plant genetic resources are of an inestimable value, and will continue to be in the future, independently of whether scientists use them by means of conventional plant breeding or modern genetic engineering. The importance of plant genetic resources as the ultimate source of food is enormous. Their loss constitutes a serious threat to world food security. On the basis of recent estimates, in developing countries alone, the production of food will need to increase by about 60% in the next 25-30 years in order to keep pace with demographic growth. It is not possible to think that this increase of production can be achieved only by increasing the yield per hectare, with indiscriminate use of chemical fertilisers or pesticides. The possibilities of extending the areas used for agriculture are relatively limited and the yield capacity of some major staple food crops are reaching a plateau. The ecological and economic consequences of increased use of agro-chemicals and irrigation development, are posing new threats to the sustainability of agriculture. To reach the objective of increased food production, certainly it is necessary to explore opportunities for diversifying the crop base of agriculture, which in turn can be reached as an outcome of the sustainable exploitation of our plant genetic diversity. In this regard, horticultural crop development could indeed represent an important component of a global plan of action for improving food security, provided that coordinated research policies and adequate investments are addressed to improving the productivity of traditional and subsistence horticultural crops. Horticultural crops are only part of the total genetic diversity, nonetheless they can contribute greatly both to satisfying food security and to integrating and diversifying dietary needs of humankind. In fact, in many regions of the world, horticultural crops are important staple food crops. In developing countries where hunger prevails, primary importance is often given to the production of basic food crops, whereas the improvement of traditional horticultural subsistence crops - many of which are also rich in proteins, fats and carbohydrates - is too often neglected."

To achieve the ambitious objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Biosafety Protocol should be interpreted as giving priority to adoption of innovative agricultural technologies that promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. As a result, the protocol should compel the rapid approval with postmarket surveillance of the low-risk genetically improved row crops that are exported in commodities shipments (in particular, corn and soybeans) that provide nations struggling with food security2 with the tools needed to meet goals for conserving biological diversity and assuring food security. Careful planning for ensuring food security and the efficient distribution of commodities will reduce the pressure that global hunger can place on conservation efforts. The single greatest threat to biodiversity in the 21st Century is likely to be the pressure to meet the needs of the billions of new human beings arriving on this planet, all of whom will need to be fed as efficiently as possible. Genetically improved crops flowing through the bulk commodities system can increase the quantity and ecological sustainability of global food production. To slow the intertwined downward spiral of hunger and biodiversity loss, the world will require efficiency of food distribution and increasing the productivity of the land currently cleared for use. The role of the bulk commodities shipments and the recombinant DNA process in promoting management of biodiversity should be documented to assist parties to the Convention in meeting its objectives. Commodities imports that ""may contain"" genetically improved crops should be permitted to continue to be freely traded without special documentation recording the details of GMO content. This nondiscriminatory treatment of the rDNA process should be compelled under the precautionary approach to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity."

Given this factor and continued economic development in today's low-income countries, the total global demand for food will increase approximately threefold over the coming half-century. Meanwhile, against this background, newly-occurring global environmental changes such as climate change are anticipated to affect food production. Other incipient large-scale environmental changes likely to affect food production include stratospheric O3 depletion, the accelerating loss of biodiversity (with knock-on effects on crop and livestock pest species) and the perturbation of several of the great elemental cycles of N and S. The ways in which these various environmental influences affect the production of food (crops and livestock on land, and wild and cultivated fisheries) are complex and interactive. Uncertainties therefore persist about how global climate change is likely to affect world and regional food production. On balance, recent modelling-based estimates indicate that, in the medium to longer term, if not over the next several decades, climate change is likely to affect crop yields adversely, especially in food-insecure regions. The prospect of increased climatic variability further increases the risks to future food production. Given these possible though uncertain adverse impacts of climatic and other environmental changes on world food production, there is a need to apply the Precautionary Principle. There are finite, and increasingly evident, limits to agro-ecosystems and to wild fisheries. Our capacity to maintain food supplies for an increasingly large and increasingly expectant world population will depend on maximizing the efficiency and sustainability of production methods, incorporating socially-beneficial genetic biotechnologies, and taking pre-emptive action to minimise detrimental ecologically-damaging global environmental changes."

Human ecology concerns principally the population ecology 'only' of Homo sapiens, but it also includes all aspects of global ecology because humans are the most important species. Human demography is characterized by a recent decline in mortality and fertility rates. These demographic transitions have largely been completed in industrialized countries, but not in the 140 developing countries. Approximately 100 countries are following the same demographic pattern as industrialized countries, however with a time delay of several generations. China has effectively reduced its population increase by means that would be unacceptable in Western democracies. Some 44 developing countries still show increasing population growth and no detectable demographic transition in birth rate. Thus one part of the world shows limited (and, in the long run, shrinking) population growth, and another continues with a strong increase. All populations are limited in their development by their sustainability by their environment, for example, food and energy resources, and the extent of pollution which the use of these resources produces. It is argued that in the case of human population the limits of sustainability have already been reached with the 6 billion humans alive today, since at least 20% of these suffer from hunger, natural resources are overexploited, and biodiversity is threatened. In the coming 200 years it is more likely that the total population will substantially oscillate rather than approach the predicted 12 billion. The most important goal of human ecology should therefore be to slow population growth as far as possible."

In terms of food and economic security, enset has been described by farmers as a 'bank', its persistence in extreme situations, or, as put in literature, resilience, plays a vital role in environmental conservation. Yet outside the area of origin and current cultivation it is arbitrarily stigmatized, especially by people located in the Northern parts of the country, as a 'poor' cultivation and only suitable for marginal groups. At the backdrop of this rhetoric of distinction the following questions will be addressed: what does the fostering of competing cuisines reveal about the (carefully state-orchestrated) process of nation- building in Ethiopia? Who are the actors implicated in the promotion of 'good' and the incrimination of 'bad' cuisines?

They have negative effects on the economy and the environment, and they are not justifiable from an ethical point of view. The food service industry was identified by Beretta et al. (2013) as the third largest source of food waste based on food input at each stage of the value added chain. The total losses are estimated 18% of the food input, the avoidable losses 13.5%. However, these estimations are related with considerable uncertainty. To get more reliable and detailed data of food losses in this sector, the waste from two companies (in the education and business sectors) was classified into four categories (storage losses, preparation losses, serving losses, and plate waste) and seven food classes and measured for a period of five days. A questionnaire evaluated customer reaction, and a material flow analysis was used to describe the mass and monetary losses within the process chain. The study found that in company A (education sector) 10.73% and in company B (business sector) 7.69% of the mass of all food delivered was wasted during the process chain. From this, 91.98% of the waste in company A and 78.14% in company B were classified as avoidable. The highest proportion of waste occurred from serving losses with starch accompaniments and vegetables being the most frequently wasted items. The quantities of waste per meal were 91.23. g (value CHF 0.74) and 85.86. g (value CHF 0.44) for company A and company B, respectively. The annual loss averaged 10.47 tonnes (value CHF 85,047) in company A and 16.55 tonnes (value CHF 85,169) in company B. The customer survey showed that 15.79% (n = 356) of the respondents in company A and 18.32% (n = 382) in company B produced plate waste. The main causes of plate waste cited were 'portion served by staff too large' and 'lack of hunger'.Sustainable measures need to be implemented in the food service industry to reduce food waste and to improve efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Two overarching perspectives on food security are identified. One centred on raising production as the core answer to under-consumption and hunger. The other is an emerging perspective, more social and ecological, accepting the need to address a complex array of problems, not just production. The first is primarily agricultural-focused; the latter a food systems approach. From its inception in post-World War 2 international reconstruction, the UN and governments have given tackling hunger a high profile, via a changing package of policy measures. Within a few decades, the production-oriented approach or paradigm was being questioned by the emerging paradigm with its more complex, multi-focused notion of the challenges ahead. When oil and agricultural commodity prices spiked in 2007-8, the complex agenda was marginalised by a renewed international focus on primary production and the needs of low-income countries. Against this background, the paper explores the diversity of perspectives on what is meant by food security, concluding that the core 21st-century task is to create a sustainable food system. This requires a more coherent policy framework than currently exists, a goal thwarted by competing solutions vying for policy attention and policy failure thus far to integrate the complex range of evidence from social as well as environmental and economic sources into an integrated policy response. © 2012 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)."

Agricultural organizations have often responded with public relations material promoting a very positive image of animal agriculture and denying all six of the critics' claims. The public, faced with these two highly simplistic and contradictory images, needs knowledgeable research and analysis to serve as a basis for public policy and individual choice. Scientists and ethicists could provide such analysis. In some cases, however, scientists and ethicists have themselves produced misleading, polarized, or simplistic accounts of animal agriculture. The problems in such accounts include the repetition of unreliable information from advocacy sources, use of unwarranted generalizations, simplistic analysis of complex issues, and glossing over the ethical problems. The New Perception debate raises important and complex ethical issues; in order to provide useful guidance, both scientists and ethicists must consider these issues as research problems that are worthy of genuine investigation and analysis."
