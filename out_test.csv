This article is part of special IPS coverage of International Womens Day on March 8 2020 Gender equality is a basic human right and a prerequisite for sustainable development  so why does inequality persist in so many countries  and what can we all do to address it?                             The economic inequalities plaguing much of the world today are reinforced by many other forms of inequality  including inequalities in sexual and reproductive health-Dr. Natalia Kanem  ED UNFPA.

This is an undoubted achievement  but is no reason for complacency. The fact is that inequality between men and women  between boys and girls  remains not only a social justice concern  but one of the impediments on development in countries across Africa and beyond. Addressing such inequalities is a duty for all of us  and one which is at the heart of the theme of this years International Womens Day on 8th March:Each for Equal. Facing reality  then act accordingly Gender inequality is so deeply ingrained in many societies that simply being born female can have a deleterious impact on a girls life chances. Too often  girls are still viewed as a drain on their families resources  kept out of school in favour of their brothers when money is tight  married off as children to older men  and condemned to a lifetime of poor health  unwanted large families and poverty. Too often  they are also condemned to illiteracy and economic dependence on men. The effort towards achieving gender equality is not only the business of women. It is the business of each of us. Male champions have a critical role to play when it comes to challenging stereotypes  fighting bias and standing up against discriminations and violence against their mothers  sisters  wives and daughters. In this regard  H.E President Uhuru Kenyatta  as a gender champion  has set a path by taking personal commitments to End Female Genital Mutilations (FGM) by the year 2022. Globally  Kenya has demonstrated its engagement against gender-based violence through the development or enactment of the following: a National Policy on Gender and Development (2019)  a National Policy for the Eradication of FGM (2019)  the Sexual Offences Act (2006)  the Counter-Trafficking Act (2011)  the Childrens Act (2001)  the Prevention against violence Act (2015)  and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act (2011). The wins for gender equality and women empowerment will also be achieved through the implementation of the Big Four Agenda which focuses on Universal Health Care  Food Security and Nutrition  Affordable Housing and Manufacturing. Win-Win The irony is that gender equality would benefit all and make no losers. In its2016 Africa Human Development Report  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) pointed out the clear intersections and interdependencies between gender equality and human development. Improving womens capabilities and opportunities improves in return their ability to contribute better economically  as employers  employees and entrepreneurs  to the common wealth; it brings social and environmental benefits in terms of better health and education  changes the attitudes that enable the scourge of physical and sexual violence against women  and works to improve sustainable resource use. Additionally  the report argues  womens political involvement leads to fairer and more representative decision-making and resource allocation  to the benefit of all and that of the environment too. Actually  none of the UN-sponsored Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) will be achieved if girls and women are institutionally and systematically discriminated against and left behind. Hence  these complex issues must be worked on at all levels at a time. While much of the gender equality debate globally focuses on income disparities  it is crucial to look beyond. Upstream  achieving equality at work is hampered by unequal access to education. Our daughters are profoundly unlikely to earn as much as our sons  or even to be able to compete for their jobs  if they have not been educated  or if societal attitudes to women allow employers to dismiss their applications out of hand. To accelerate the achievement of SDGs and in particular SDG 5 on Gender equality will help  among others  ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. And it happens that healthiest women with fewer chores at home can spend more time prospecting on the job market  and ultimately secure higher revenues to sustain their families. For these virtuous circles to become our everyday reality  we need to go deeper  to challenge the social and political norms and entrenched interests that prevail in many nations  communities and families. A mission for each of us But what can we  as individuals  do? How can we help shape a world where your gender does not dictate your future? Each of us needs to understand how his/her own thoughts and actions shape society. TheEach for Equalcampaign urges each of us to challenge our deeply-held assumptions about girls and women  about their abilities and rights. Silence always benefits the status quo and perpetuates situations of oppression. Conversely  speaking up takes courage  determination  and a willingness to stand out from the crowd. Our thoughts and actions are powerful. Our voices are powerful when we use them to speak up against the injustice we testify  or to celebrate womens aspirations and achievements. It is both an individual and collective responsibility to achieve justice  opportunity and equality for half the worlds population. The reasoning is valid both nationally and worldwide. 25 years after the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing  the 2020 Generation Equality Forum will gather governments  the United Nations  civil society  feminist groups and other stakeholders to call for action and accountability for the full realization of the gender equality agenda. Priority issues and structural obstacles to progress on gender equality will be put at the center of the agenda  and stakeholders will make commitments along six thematic coalitions of action: Gender-Based violence  Economic justice and rights  Bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights  Feminist action for climate justice  Technology and innovation for gender equality  Feminist movements and leadership. An outcome of the Forum will be the establishment of a mobilization strategy to make concrete progress on gender equality. Convened by UN-Women  co-hosted by Mexico (Mexico City  7-8 May) and France (Paris  7-10 July)  and organized in partnership with civil society  the Forum is animated by a single  overarching ambition: streamline gender equality as an asset  and a prerequisite  to achieve any political objective  anywhere in the world. At the end of the day  gender equality is not merely an agenda item for the UN and the development sector. It is rather a necessity for human society to thrive  and perhaps even to survive  in a future of diminishing resources and mounting global challenges such as climate change.

   Credits     UNDP Bangladesh/Fahad Kaizer Vulnerable people in developing countries like Bangladesh are expected to be hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.      The COVID-19 pandemic which has swept across the developed and developing world is exposing the frailties and inequalities of our societies  according to the UN Deputy Secretary-General. Speaking to UN News  Amina Mohammed said that the global crisis unleashed by the virus could and should kickstart efforts to reach theSustainable Development Goals  the 17 globally agreed targets to eradicate poverty  create a more equal and peaceful world and protect the planet. UN News: How concerned are you that global inequalities will deepen as a result of the coronavirus pandemic? UN Deputy Secretary-General  Amina Mohammed: I am extremely concerned.COVID-19is a threat multiplier. We have a health emergency  a humanitarian emergency and now a development emergency. These emergencies are compounding existing inequalities. In advanced economies  were seeing higher rates of mortality among already marginalized groups. And in developing countries  the crisis will hit vulnerable populations even harder. Weak health systems wont be able to cope. Incomplete social protection systems risk seeing millions fall back into poverty. And governments with little economic firepower will not be able to cushion the impacts or recover quickly. Every single person will be affected by this pandemic. And no one will be able to get through this alone. We will need an extraordinary showing of solidarity for all people to come out of COVID-19 stronger or we risk huge populations falling further behind. Any deepening of the divides risks people falling into povertylosing hard won gains and weakening our systems to respond to the next emergency.           To what extent do you think COVID-19 will exacerbate already dire poverty levels in the developing world? We are learning on so many levels how this pandemic is exposing the frailties and inequalities of our societies. TheIMFis projecting that the global economy will contract sharply by -3 per cent this year. TheILOis warning that 1.6 billion workers in the informal economynearly half of the global workforcestand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed. And remittances to developing countries have already fallen by 20 per cent. All of this will feed into higher rates of poverty. In fact  the World Bank has estimated that some 49 million people could fall back into extreme poverty. But this is not inevitable. We have the tools available globally to provide developing countries with the fiscal space and the resources needed to support the incomes of the poorest; to protect their communities from the worst effects and to be ready for recovery. And building on this  we can recover better increasing the coverage of essential services; generating green jobs for a green recovery.

Saving lives as first responders  finding solutions as innovators  standing up to the pandemic as political leaders. More men are dying from the virus than women  but women are bearing the brunt of this pandemic in other ways. Women make up nearly 60 per cent of the informal economy  they earn less and are at greater risk of falling into poverty. They are the majority of the worlds older people  more likely to live alone and less likely to have access to the internet or mobile phones thus increasing their risk of isolation. Weve seen a terrifying increase in violence against women. We know that staying at home is fostering the perfect storm for domestic violence. We know that gender equality and womens rights are essential to building a better future for everyone. And Ive been inspired by women leaders who have stepped up to face the pandemic and are rising to for all to come together in solidarity. What concerns do you have about development funding from richer nations decreasing as the global economy falters? Right now  we are not seeing a drop in funding. The UN is crystal clear that the worlds response is only as strong as the weakest health system. And governments recognize that the virus does not respect borders. They also know that if the virus spreads rapidly to contexts affected by humanitarian crises  or in a number of developing countries  then the risks of political instability  of conflict  or of displacement  are very real. No one stands to benefit from this. There may be short-term benefits for the climate during this crisis but how will action to reduce climate change  which is central to poverty reduction  be affected in the long term? Global emissions are forecast to decline by around 6 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic. However  we know that the economic and industrial downturn as a result of thecoronaviruspandemic is not a substitute for sustained climate action. Economies can grow  and jobs created alongside ambitious climate action  if the right investments are made now to accelerate the decarbonization of the global economies. We need sustained climate action for many years to come to meet the goals of theParis Agreement.  Is it possible to turn crisis into a catalyst for achieving goals and reducing inequalities? Absolutely. And in some respects  there is no choice here. We cannot afford to go back to the world we had before this crisis. That would mean leaving unaddressed the vulnerabilities and fragilities that this crisis has brought into plain sight: massive underinvestment in health and social protection; massive global and local inequalities; the onward march towards the destruction of nature and climate catastrophe; the erosion of democratic norms that are core to protecting rights and ensuring social cohesion. We have a unique opportunity now  to leverage this crisis to kickstart a Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Is the timetable for realizing the goals which will help to reduce inequality now unrealistic? This crisis has already demonstrated that massive change can be brought about if there is political will and unity of purpose. The SDGs are no longer an aspirational set of goals for some distant future. They are the minimum we need to secure a safer  more just and more sustainable world for all. If leaders from across society attach the same level of importance and urgency to the fight against poverty  hunger  and climate change  we will find success in this Decade of Action on the SDGs.

   Credits     Coffee Handler with Beans from Coffee Cooperative Coffee is not only the primary cash crop in Timor-Leste  it is the main income earner after oil and gas | UN Photo/Martine Perret   Investment Advisor Joint SDG Fund  Part 2: Crafting a UN systemic response  By end of March-in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis - the Joint SDG Fund received 258 proposals for supporting SDG financing interventions in over 100 countries  including LDCs  SIDS  and countries experiencing conflict and fragility (see this blog describing the SDG Financing Call). These impressive proposals reflect a UN systemic response to accelerate the achievements of the Sustainable Development Goals at the time of COVID-19. Through public and private partnerships and innovative approaches they aim to contribute to a future that is more sustainable  climate-resilient  and inclusive. An early analysis of the Funds portfolio suggests a number of contributions (often overlapping in recognition of the Funds philosophy of integrated approaches impacting multiple SDGs) to the COVID-19 economic and social response that is in line with the UN framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 (i.e. pillars 3 4 5  6 and 8).[1] These contributions are presented along the 2 components of the Call: ENABLING ENVIRONMENT: THE SDG FINANCING ARCHITECTURE (Component 1) Haiti  Cash for Work  Participants Receive Payment | UN Photo/Sophia Paris Operationalization of public/private financial relief and recovery plans  The readiness and commitment of national and sub-national governments will determine the results of the recovery plans on peoples lives. The UN can leverage its existing work and partnerships to support the development and enhancement of planning and delivery systems  including financial frameworks  and enhanced local systems to improve execution and procurement. Capacity development interventions can help channel the necessary resources where they matter  while effectively supporting the delivery of services. Planned activities can structurally strengthen existing financing structures and optimize the spending. They can address knowledge gaps in SDG costing and expenditure  support multi-stakeholder platforms  and inform policy and institutional reforms to better align financing flows with the SDGs. Establishment of a new generation of risk-responsive financing frameworks and solutions The way in which revenues are spent is as important as how resources are mobilized. Medium-term expenditure frameworks  for example  bring together a comprehensive picture of a countrys fiscal system. Expenditure frameworks should be aligned to the SDGs  which can be facilitated by integrated national financing frameworks (INFFs). Revamped frameworks for performance-based fiscal transfers will help people and businesses in need. INFFs and Government strategies need to become more risk-aware  learning from the financing mechanisms framed for disaster risk response and climate change  including emergency cash transfers and insurance schemes. INFFs should also safeguard SDG progress in the face of adversity and major future unforeseen crises. Continuous participatory engagement and impact measurement for the SDGs in financing frameworks As larger volumes of public and private spending are allocated in the short and medium-term to crisis response (both health and economic crises)  participatory and inclusive mechanisms suitable for review and impact measurement should be in place. Effectiveness and efficiency considerations will grow in importance as austerity may follow the expansionary period. Component 1 proposals support the development of high quality and inclusive financing plans that are impartially monitored for impact.  CATALYTIC INVESTMENT FOR SDG ACCELERATION (Component 2) Haitians Plant and Save Land in Cash-for-Work Programme |UN Photo/Logan Abassi Economic recovery Small and Medium Enterprises and value-chain financing  including agriculture  nature-based and social enterprises clearly  emerged as a priority from the portfolio-along with solutions (including fintech)-in inclusive finance. Financial instruments linked to blended finance structures  such as guarantees  smart subsidies and technical assistance are also suggested. The exploration of thematic bonds and faith-based financing is relevant in the current context and-given early evidence of SDG/green bonds good performance. A second group of proposals look at mobilizing resources for critical infrastructure  a typical feature of employment-generating recovery plans. Critical infrastructure typically includes water and sanitation and energy infrastructure.  Vulnerable groups/countries and financing for health and social protection The origin of the proposals received has demonstrated the ability of the UN system to work in the most difficult contexts on integrated approaches: LDCs submitted a record 57 concept notes (1/3 of submissions received) while most SIDS and conflict/fragile countries submitted one or more concept notes. Moreover  some concept notes focus on financing solutions for vulnerable groups such as children  women  and rural poor. These include financial mechanisms to leverage multiple sources of financing to combat malnutrition  support early childhood development and education  among others.  Management of natural ecosystems and climate actions The COVID-19 crisis has not solved some of the other imminent threats for the human society  including the impact of climate change and the destruction of ecosystems that permit life on earth. COVID-19 responses should be mindful of these concurrent and inter-linked crises. Moreover  the increasing frequency of disease outbreaks can be directly linked to climate change and biodiversity loss (WEF)  including COVID-19 and Ebola. Related concept notes propose blue and green finance solutions for the better management of ecosystems and climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Moreover  the creation of sustainable and green business should be a foundation of economic recovery (e.g. blue economy for SIDS). The current health crisis holds profound lessons that can help address climate change and protect our planet if people and businesses greater economic and environmental resiliency becomes the compass for the years ahead (McKinsey). While the world will undoubtedly experience tough times ahead  SDG financing frameworks are part of the solution. Some of the positive trends that emerged before the crisis  from fintech to responsible investing and meaningful public-private collaboration  should now be accelerated. This health and economic crisis is aunique opportunity to make the world more inclusive and sustainable.  The Joint SDG Fund looks forward to playing its role and support a coherent and cohesive UN system. Component 1 programming will support countries 'doing more and better with less' in the new post-COVID world by integrating the SDGs across national public financial systems and more effective public-private collaboration  ensuring that none is left behind. Component 2 programming will fast track financing solutions for economic recovery that are inclusive and centered on vulnerable groups to make societies and economies more resilient and sustainable.

 Parliamentary Assistant - European Parliament. On September 6th  2017 I watched Hurricane Irma destroy my home  the Caribbean island of Saint. Maarten/Saint. Martin. After the hurricane passed  I was unable to contact my parents for over 24 hours. All I had to tide me over were news broadcasts showing half of my island underwater  flattened concrete buildings  and pieces of cars  boats  and roofs littering the streets. On Saint. Maarten  I grew up experiencing hurricanes and tropical storms. However  the apocalyptic destruction caused by Hurricane Irma was unlike anything I could have imagined. It broke records in 2017 when it maintained an intensity of 185 mph winds for 37 hours. More importantly  it showed me that un-contained climate change would eventually destroy the place I call home. While hurricanes occur naturally  there is growing evidence that they are being supercharged by climate change. Hurricanes begin with atmospheric heat and are fueled by warm ocean water. The rise in greenhouse gasses can be linked to the rising temperatures of ocean water. In fact  since 1901  ocean surface temperatures have increased by .072 C per decade. The hotter the air is  the more water the atmosphere can hold  creating prime hurricane conditions. The months of July in 2015 and 2016 were the hottest in 137 years. The heat from those months remained and kept the atmosphere primed for hurricane season. The following Atlantic hurricane seasons in 2017  2018  and 2019 led to record hurricanes including  Hurricane Irma  Hurricane Maria  Hurricane Harvey  Hurricane Florence  Hurricane Michael  and Hurricane Dorian. The United Nations recognizes 29 Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean region. Most of these SIDs are located in prime hurricane real estate and are extremely vulnerable to the damage caused by major storms due to their topography  low sea levels  and limited funds for disaster preparedness. In fact  despite the differences among Caribbean island nations  one commonality is that they are extremely susceptible to the impacts of climate change despite barely contributing to it. In 2017  survivors on my island and other Caribbean nations had to contend with a loss of proper habitat  prolonged power outages  a shortage of necessities such as water and food  strained mental health  increased chronic/vector/water-borne diseases  and debilitated or non- existent health care facilities. Not only is climate change creating inhabitable and dangerous environments  but it is also leading to exacerbating levels of migration. Going beyond the Caribbean  climate inaction is expected to lead to the migration of over 143 million people in just Latin America  South  Asia  and Sub Saharan Africa by 2050. Increased migration is projected to lead to conflicts over natural resources  competition over water and food  security concerns  disease  and rising hostile nationalism. While worsening hurricanes are the primary battle that many Caribbean SIDS will face  all countries will have their own climate change battles. Therefore  we must band together regardless of nationality to combat climate change through SDG 13. According to UNEP  we are on the brink of impactful action. Any temperature increase past 1.5 C will result in progressively severe and widespread consequences. Currently  temperatures have already increased by 1.1C. To limit the rise of temperatures  emissions worldwide must be reduced by a collective 7.6% every year between 2020 and 2030.The risk of climate change inaction also has dire economic consequences. For every additional ton of CO2  the global social cost exceeds $400. Based on 2017 CO2 emissions  the global impact exceeds $16 trillion. Youth must be at the forefront of the climate battle. Current climate plans are not stringent enough to tackle present emission levels or create lasting impact before 2030. In many cases  party politics cloud scientific facts  and some countries continue to pretend that we need to choose between economic prosperity and the health of citizens. Future and current generations must have a say in climate action as we are the ones who will be the most impacted by it. These are several actionable items that we as youth can engage in to further SDG 13: We can create and lead advocacy movements that spread climate awareness We can raise funds and use the income to promote sustainable change We can get involved in local politics and push our politicians to pass sustainable policies and laws. We can volunteer our time to climate change NGOs and organizations. We can harness the power of social media to connect and create truly global movements and communities. We are the last generation that can combat climate change. If we do not take action by implementing the necessary preventative measures in the next decade  it will be especially damaging to SIDS such as my island  Saint. Maarten. Some may even be destroyed beyond repair. But most importantly  it will lead to the creation of a potentially uninhabitable world and economy for all generations to come  regardless of nationality  monetary status  or physical location., 13
  On April 27 - May 2  the Legal Aid Service (LAS) attorneys undertookthe training of trainers course on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) - International and National Standards. Photo:  OHCHR Georgia The training was held with the support from theSouth Caucasus Field Presence of the High Commissioner for Human Rights(OHCHR)  with the funds from theUN Sustainable Development Fund(SDG Fund) and theUnited Nations Partnership for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities(UNPRPD). After this training on these attorneys are eligible to build capacity of their fellow lawyers using the curriculum developed by OHCHR with the financial support from the UN SDG Fund. Welcoming the training participants  OHCHR Program ManagerSophio Benashviliemphasized the importance of legal aid for PWDs for full realization of their rights. According to her  there is a need to focus on the continuing education of lawyers and human rights defenders in international and local standards of communication with PWDs.  There is still a big need of raising public awareness on the need and rights of PWDs  as there are still discriminatory attitudes and stigma towards PWDs in the society. State institutions should take the term 'inclusiveness' in a broad sense  as a means by which any citizen can function in a society.   said the training participant  a lawyer of the LAS  Teona Kvernadze. Ledi Kordzadze  a lawyer of the LAS believes that PWDs are full-fledged members of society and they do not need morality from society and the state. Their right to full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms is guaranteed. Therefore  it is our role as lawyers to protect PWDs rights by establishing proper communication with them.   As a practicing lawyer  it was very important for me to get acquainted with the theoretical material and practice of international and national legislation on the rights of PWDs. This will help me to set a strategy on how to restore PWDs rights of labor  independent living and other basic rights. At the same time  my role as a future trainer is particularly responsible  to help my colleagues increase their knowledge about the rights of PWDs.  LAS consultant Lela Euashvili pointed out.  The right of access to justice gives any person the opportunity to protect another person and his/her rights. Consequently  the right to access to justice is a vital right for PWDs. We  the lawyers  have a special role to play in helping PWDs realize these important rights  without compromising their other rights  and it is important to constantly deepen our knowledge and pass it on to our colleagues. Stated Tea Kaulashvili  a lawyer of the LAS. The topics covered at the training included: Standards for the Relationship with Persons with Disabilities; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Practice of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in relation to specific rights; the National Legislative Framework for the Protection of Persons with Disabilities; techniques and methods of conducting the training. Among the trainers were experts: Ekaterine Tavartkiladze  Sopho Chachava  Giorgi Chkheidze  Ana Abashidze and Ana Arganashvili., 17

Mohammed In 2020 its difficult to fathom that there are still women pioneers in centuries-old fields like banking and finance. That there are still firsts when it comes to women joining corporate boards or leading companies  when it should be the norm that the world profits from women in leadership that has been mainstreamed. In his recentspeech on women and power  the United Nations Secretary-General and feminist-in-chief  Antonio Guterres  pointed out the worlds need for more womens voices at the forefront in peace negotiations and trade talks and in boardrooms. When women enter spaces once dominated by men  it changes those spaces  bringing in new perspectives  correcting blind spots  andultimately improving decision-making. It will take women and men to make this a reality. Because anyone who has the privilege to sit at the table  has a responsibility to make room for parity. We are just a few days away from celebrating International Womens Day  and I am thrilled thatKristalina Georgieva  Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund andLouise Levonian  Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund are sharing their plans for parity with us.

But we do. Why? Because there are simply too few women in leadership positions all over the world. On the eve of International Womens Day and as we approach the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote here in the US  the time is right to get a handle on the problem. IMF staffresearchfrom a wide array of perspectives clearly shows the economic benefits of promoting gender equality policies. And the bottom line is this  more women in the workforce and in more senior positions is good news for women  good news for businesses  and good news for their countries economies. Despite some progress  large gender gaps in employment and income persist. For example  the average workforce participation rate for women globally sits 20 percentage points lower than the male rate. Moreover  on average across countries  women have just three-fourths of the legal rights  such as owning property  receiving an inheritance  or opening a bank account  afforded to men. And even though five advanced economies have a gender gap of 5 percentage points or lower  the average gap for advanced economies remains at 10 percentage points. Together  these imbalances are not only costly to society in the form of lower productivity and forgone economic growth. They also rob women of economic empowerment and leadership opportunities. More women at the top Look at the financial system. Women are missing at all levels  from depositors and borrowers to bank board members and regulators. Women also account for less than two per cent of financial institutions chief executive officers and less than 20 per cent of executive board members. Mounting evidence suggests  however  that narrowing the gender gap in leadership does pay off. In a previouspaper  IMF staff found that banks with higher shares of women board members had higher capital buffers  a lower proportion of nonperforming loans  and greater resistance to financial stress. IMF staff also found the same relationship between bank stability and the presence of women on banking regulatory boards. In another IMF staffstudy which looked at two million firms in 34 countries in Europe  greater gender diversity in senior positions was associated with higher profitability of firms. More precisely  it found that one more woman in senior management or on a corporate board is associated with 813 basis points higher return on assets. These findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of greater diversity of views on boards  as it broadens the range ofperspectivesand improves the quality of decision making and discussion  leading to better outcomes for businesses. From laggers to leaders Still  just 18 per cent of firms globally are led bywomen  and on average  only 22 per cent of board members in OECD countries are women. There is even lower representation in emerging economies  such as India at 13 per cent or 8 per cent in Brazil. Progress has been slow to say the least. At the IMF  we are trying to walk the walk. Currently  over 30 percent of staff in senior management are women  and 35 per cent of department directors are women. We also continue to promote gender diversity on our Executive Board. While female representation over the past 14 years has increased overall  as more women are holding advisor and senior advisor positions  the share of female executive directors has hovered around 49 per cent. Currently  women hold three out of 24 executive director positions and three of 30 alternate executive director positions  with total representation at 9 per cent for 2019. More women on the IMFs executive board means more diverse views at the table tackling todays critical global challenges  such as climate change  inequality  and social inclusion  by developing innovative solutions for our 189-member countries. It can also enhance institutional performance and effectiveness. Indeed  previous studies have shown that when companies invest more in gender diversity  they tend to receive higher dividends on organizational excellence  including through leadership  direction  accountability  and values  relative to non-diverse companies. This brings us to how our initial question of why there are so few women leaders applies to the IMFs own Executive Board. To respond  we plan to: Raise awareness with member-country governments  on the importance of considering  and selecting  more women to be nominated as Executive and Alternate Executive Directors.Consider how the Fund  as an institution could reduce barriers to gender diversity at the Board. Provide networking opportunities for female staff to meet and share experiences to informally mentor others during their tenure at the IMF. As we celebrate International Womens Day and the achievements of women from all around the world  we must remember that including women in the global economy requires action. We can continue to push harder and do more. The next time someone asks  where are all the women? I believe we will be able to proudly sayin the boardroom.

Photo: UNDP Mexico   Governance and Democracy Associate and Gender Focal Point  UNDP Mexico The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has the world in check andMexico is no exception.Yet the virus  despite its unprecedent scale and speed of transmission  represents many of the same challenges for women as other crises. In it women are in thefrontline ashealthprofessionals  volunteers and caregivers  and areoften performing several of thosetasksat the same time.They arealso disproportionatelyaffected by thelack of health care  their level of unpaid work  and by the violencethat exists in thesespaces  whether public or private. It isessential to analyzeour responseto COVID-19 with women in mind  since wecan predict that they will be affected differently. To slow the spread of the virus the Government of Mexico has closed public and private schools  and non-essential businesses and encouraged social distancingwhere citizens are advised to stay at home as much as possible and when out in public to be two metres away from others. Having children home from school places an extra burden on women. It is estimated that three-quarters of the unpaid care workis done by women  equivalent to US$287.291 million dollarsper year or23.5 percent of national GDP.Also  according to OXFAM women constitute two-thirds of the workforce that deals with paid care work. In this situation  care policiesshould beconsideredan extraordinary provision ofsocial security formothers and fathers who  in health crises like the present  need to to beabsentfrom their work to take care of children.This would allow both men and women not tohavenegativeconsequencesin economic  and professionalterms  andin theuse of their time. In Mexico of the475 000 people in nursing careers  only 15 percent are men so women are in thefrontlineof healthcare exposing themdirectly to the coronavirus. The security and health of first responders must be apriority.However as nursesarealso most probably the onesin charge of the care workin their homes  itis important thathealth systemsconsideredpermits forhealth workers  regardless of their gender  toleaveand care for their families. In the last 10 years 43.9 percent of Mexican women aged 15 and over19.1 millionhave faced violence from a current or former partner.These figures pose a scenario that couldincreasetherisk of violence. Women survivors may face additional obstacles toescapeviolent situations due to the obligation toshare a home with their aggressors. Itis vital thatessential services count on protocols forprevention  and control and minimize the riskof violence  and  where appropriate  act against these contexts. The inequalities that women facefortheir development are deep.Mexico UNDP appealstothegovernments  civil society  academia  private sector  international organizations and families tounderstand how differently COVID-19 will affect womenthan men.This willallow for egalitarian policies toavoidreproducing inequality  and to insureno one is left behind.

Photo ILO/Nicolas Axelrod     Viet Nam's social insurance reform looks into various options to develop a multi-tiered structure which offers support to working parents of newborns in compulsory and voluntary system. HANOI (ILO News) On an abnormally hot day in late summer  a sudden blackout made the atmosphere in a small alley in Binh Xa Village  Binh Phu Commune  Thach That District in the outskirt of Hanoi almost unbreathable. Two young women were busy nursing their newborns who both did not seem comfortable with the heat.Living at two premises so close to each other that they could hear the other babys crying  Nguyen Thi Lan and Nguyen Thi Ngoc were both 22 years old and could be seen in their pajamas almost day long like many other stay-at-home mums.Despite many similarities  Lan and Ngoc lived completely opposite lives as the way their homes faced each other. Lan  a single mum with neither income nor insurance  was struggling to feed her two children and paying the rent for an 8sq.m apartment on her own. Meanwhile  Ngoc happily lived with her husband in a new 3-storey house  a wedding present from her parents-in-law  and would soon return to her full time accounting job after the 6-month maternity leave.However  they met again as both new mothers were still in a shock of how having children can be that financially challenging.Our just-married life was so comfortable with our income as we already had a house thanks to our parents support. But with a little girl now  it is not that easy anymore  said Ngoc who holds a university degree and an insured job with potential benefits for her small family as her husband  a carpenter  does not have a formal employment. I have to think twice now before buying anything.Both women wished if only they had a regular financial support to cover the costs of feeding and bringing up their tiny angels.Lan and Ngoc are among 44 per cent of all workers in Viet Nam who are currently experiencing the challenge  the extra cost of bringing up children  according to a new study by the International Labour Organization (ILO).Among them  Lans case could be towards the darker end of the spectrum.Moving in with her wealthy boyfriend two years ago when she worked as a garment worker without a formal contract  they soon welcomed their first baby boy with tremendous happiness. But when finding out that she was pregnant with their second child  she also discovered that he was cheating on her.Completely shattered  Lan moved out  rented the slum-like apartment in this village to live with her first son waiting for her due date although she no longer worked at the factory and received no financial support from the wealthy boyfriend.I have been using all my savings to pay the rent and childcare fee for my son  both about VND2 million per month. My aunt brings us some food every day. But since this little girl was born  I have had to also buy formula which is costly as I dont have any breast milk  possibly because I have been under-nourished  she said throwing a sorrowful gaze at her 20-day-old infant whom she intended to leave with her aunt in two months time to go back to work. Social security People can never anticipate their lives can change like that so fast. Thats why the ILO insists on the importance of the social security system to make sure that life challenges dont push people into poverty. If Lan hadever known she would go on that downward spiral  she would not have left her factory job. She even wished the factory had paid social insurance for her  so she could have had at least maternity benefits and health insurance for herself and the baby.

Income security for children is considered one of the four basic social security guarantees by ILO Recommendation 202 on social protection floors and Convention 102 on social security.

   Credits     SDG Global Festival of Action Credit: Steve Buswell   Social research and public policy student at New York UniversityMillenium campus network fellow and SDG global youth advocate As the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic  a crisis our generation has never seen before  we must recognize the unique opportunity it has provided us with to experience and appreciate personal health in a way never done before  and in so doing  find a way to promote SDG #3  good health and well-being. The creation of a sustainable world  and reaching economic  environmental and social goals  is highly dependent on having a thriving and healthy human population. This is why the coronavirus has rocked the world  leading to a multitude of socio-economic challenges that have contributed to the world economic growth being slowed by a rate of 0.1% in the last few months. At this moment in time  the travel industry has been crippled  entire companies are shutting down and workers in the service industry are facing the prospect of going months without pay. While the effects of the virus are widespread and devastating  we can and already have started to learn from it. An example of this can be seen among the youth  who are leveraging social media as a way to spread awareness and information about the virus. The youth in Kenya have been particularly enthusiastic with this approach  going as far as organizing an online concert to raise awareness about the virus and emphasize the importance of maintaining ones mental health while in quarantine. This has resulted in a wider appreciation for our health and wellbeing on social media. While this may not seem like much  it presents itself as a contributory factor to the control of COVID-19 and the promotion of SDG #3 as a whole  both now and in the future. This has been demonstrated by a 2018 study by the University of Birmingham  as it reported that up to 46% of youth surveyed made health related choices based on the social media content that they consume. Public bodies  organizations  companies and health authorities also have a responsibility to ensure that the spread of COVID-19 is contained and that the lessons we are learning from it are acted upon and replicated. However  we as individuals need to match their efforts as well  so as to minimize the effects of the current pandemic and avoid public health crises like these in future. In a similar spirit  the efforts of the youth doing their part to contain the virus should not go unnoticed nor unsupported  as groups such as the Global Shapers have been able to impact more than 50 countries. Access to information and access to healthcare facilities are basic rights all over the world  and this is something that we can all contribute to at an individual and social level  with or without financial resources. Thus  as we hope for a swift end to this pandemic  we must remember to internalize and replicate the lessons that we have learned concerning the utility of social media as an information sharing tool in such times. Benjamin Franklin famously stated that an apple a day keeps the doctor away  but I dont think him  nor anyone else for that matter  would have ever thought that a post a day could save hundreds of lives., 3
   Credits     Photo Credit @UNWomen   University student in Bangladesh  The concept of Gender Equality is anything  but foreign to the world. Yet  even after all of the marches  petitions  activism  torture and even deaths  it seems like every step that is taken forward is faced with ten steps back. SDG 5 on Gender Equality comprises targets that touch upon a variety of issues that women face every day  globally. One of those targets to be achieved by the 2030 agenda states  Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres  including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.(UNDP). According to data  from 87 countries across the globe  1 in 5 women and girls  who are under the age of 50 will have been subjected to physical or sexual violence in the span of a year (UN Women). One would think that all this data and research would help omit domestic violence by bringing more awareness to the horror that is a massive violation of rights; however  if anything  its as if things havent improved  as brought to light by the lockdowns imposed across countries due to Covid-19. The very moment Covid-19 was declared as a pandemic  leaders across the world left no stones unturned to put into practice advised methods of prevention and treatment that would help slow the spread of the virus. The norm became city-wide and country-wide lockdowns. These lockdowns meant social distancing and not getting out of the house unless absolutely necessary. While for some  it was time to catch up on lost rest or practice a forgotten hobby  for victims of domestic violence  it was the horror of knowing that they were trapped in confined walls with their abusers with no possible escape. In fact  according to The Guardian  Covid-19 is basically fueling domestic violence. Advocates and activists have very openly expressed the torture that victims may be subjected to during the lockdowns as stress and isolation can trigger violent behaviors. This is owing to the fact that these unprecedented times have been nothing but stressful for everyone. The stay at home orders  issued in light of the pandemic  have given abusers the space to physically vent out their frustrations on the victims who range from children to women to men. Lockdowns have also woven travel bans and restrictions  making it impossible for victims to escape to seek solace elsewhere. Perpetrators also have begun to practice abuse by withholding objects of importance to the victims  such as phones  and emotionally berating victims. It was these notions of nightmares that became a reality. Indias NCW reported that it had a registration of 587 domestic violence cases from March 23  April 16  which is a significant jump from 396 registrations taking place between February 27  March 22. As reported by MPs  in the UK  calls increased by 49% to a national domestic abuse helpline  while killings were reported to have doubled just weeks after the lockdown implementation. From a report in April  it was found that 14 women and 2 children had been killed in just the first 3 weeks of the lockdown  which is the highest number of killings in such a period of time in 11 years!  In the first week of the lockdown  abuse of male victims also saw a surge with 35% rise in calls. According to a survey  4 249 women and 456 children were victims of domestic violence according to Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF) in Bangladesh during the pandemic lockdown. Theres an indication of isolation and stress triggers as 1 672 women and 424 children of that total were first time victims. While Italy saw a fall in the reports of domestic violence  almost after the completion of a month of lockdown  support groups actually showed concerns over the fact that the fall in reported cases didnt necessarily indicate a lesser amount of abuse  it indicated a lesser ability to seek help. Although calls saw a 55% decline in March 2020  when compared to the same month last year  the idea that it was nowhere close to the real picture is what is horrifying. And while countries took initiatives to fight this upsurge in domestic violence  while keeping a hold of the lockdown in the form of creating space to report via WhatsApp messaging  establishing increased hotline numbers and tele-counseling  asking citizens to keep an ear out to protect and report violent neighbors  providing hotel spaces for victims and even deciding not to fine them for fleeing their household of violence  its nowhere close to the end. Because of the pandemic regulations  new data suggests that at least 15 million additional cases of domestic violence can be expected around the globe this year. Moreover  its also being projected by research that from 114 low and mid income countries  44 million women will not have access to contraceptives because of the lockdowns  which may result in an estimation of 1 million unintentional pregnancies. According to International Planned Parenthood Federation  5000 clinics have closed in 64 countries across the globe  which Marie Stopes International reported could result in 3 million unintentional pregnancies with 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11 000 deaths in pregnancy related cases. At the end of the day  we ask ourselves the same questions over and over again. Why still? When will we be safe? Will gender based violence end?And the most importantly  will we have gender equality by 2030?, 5

While the world has been hit with the hardest blow since World War Two  optimists envision a new world characterized by solidarity and joint action. Still  the crisis does not seem to have shuffled the cards: the poorest will suffer the most and will likely become even poorer and more vulnerable. With a large share of the worlds production chain in full or partial lockdown  vast numbers of people are already suffering the loss of their incomes. The response from the states has been bold: in matters of weeks over US$8 trillion has been mobilized to avoid even larger crisis-induced business losses among the G20 economies. The COVID-19 crisis has swiftly reaffirmed the role of public authorities to lead the response of wider society (see Pikettys last contribution in Le Monde and Mazzucatos in the Guardian). However  the call for solidarity-endorsed by most leaders everywhere-has failed to surpass political and geographical boundaries and recovery plans remain largely national. There is still time to act even though Official Development Assistance is flat or backsliding as percentage of global GDP and the calls from the United Nations (and others) remain open and largely unfunded.  The COVID-19 induced crisis will have a major negative impact on efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around the world. This note presents ways in which SDG financing enabling measures and catalytic investments can fit and serve in these challenging times. In this context  the IMF switched from a general forecast of growth in plus 160 countries to one in which 170 countries may experience negative income growth and where about US$100 billion of capital has already flown from developing countries  a drop even sharper than the 2008 financial crisis  and the cost of borrowing is rising. The way forward remains uncharted. The way financial measures and recovery plans are shaped will define whether we can build a new world that is fairer and sustainable.                             @UNWomen                                                    Financing responses to COVID-19 are different in the sequential phases of the crisis  i.e. preparedness  emergency  and recovery. Preparedness is about investing early in mitigation strategies and identifying financing instruments to be accessed in the case of an emergency. Options available in the emergency phase vary and depend on Government and private sector ability to quickly deploy financial means and/or attract international support. Recovery plans and aid rely on large monetary and fiscal stimulus to rebalance the economy and provide liquidity.  The IMF and OECD created a data base of economic/financial measures announced by countries worldwide along with appropriate recommendations. This is a mix of several policies: liquidity support to the real and financial sectors  fiscal expansionary policies with transfers to individuals and businesses (e.g. cash transfers  etc.) and increased (often debt-funded) public health and social protection spending.  Central banks have similarly enhanced existing quantitative easing schemes and other expansionary measures. Public finance options are  however  not available to many developing countries; record high-debt levels (see World Bank analysis in Global Waves of Debt) leave limited space for monetary and fiscal interventions. The IMFs facilities  many of which were enhanced after the financial crisis and with 25 countries now being extended debt relief from the institution  will be tested along with regional ones  but are still likely to be insufficient as they stand (see African ministers of finance call for debt relief)  including the IMFs Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.  Innovative financing models have been announced by international financial institutions  including the African Development Banks US$3 billion COVID-19 social bond  the World Banks complementary US$14 billion COVID-19 response plan to the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility and others and others. IFC  UN and others have highlighted the potential of social or health bonds  despite limitations and criticism. The IMF has again been called upon to aggressively issue Special Drawing Rights (Brookings). Moreover  while it is impossible to measure today  there is anecdotal evidence that philanthropy has also grown considerably - ranging from $billion-like pledges (e.g. Jack Dorseys and Googles) to small individual-giving while taking advantage of fintech (i.e. crowdfunding) and innovative partnerships with corporations. The Gates foundation  Mastercard and Wellcome have launched the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to fund R&D efforts. GoFundMe.com reported growth in donations with a US$120 million funding for COVID-19 campaigns. Vanguard Charitable donors mobilized over US$31 million with an average grant of US$14 000 (Reuters as of April 07  2020). Plans are being outlined for the future. For example  one view is When the public health emergency of COVID-19 starts to subside  government support should be prioritized for companies  sectors and business activities that help respond to crises such as the climate emergency and inequality  rather than those that risk exacerbating them (Principles for Responsible Investment report on COVID-19). COVID-19 is questioning-on a fundamental level-the role of Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) integration  which is critical for protecting and accelerating SDG achievements. Early evidence suggests that investments in sustainable businesses are performing well during the crisis  also due in part to the impact of the oil prices on these portfolios (impactalpha). Therefore  the unfolding trends in financing that were already in play prior to the COVID-19 crisis and which offered ways forward in respect to closing the SDG financing gaps  will be even more relevant in shaping the economic and social recovery going forward. These are: Technological innovations and fintech (i.e. faster and inclusive outreach); The rapid growth of thematic or responsible investing (i.e. alignment of capital with impact); Outcome and results-based payment schemes and tools (i.e. science-based evidence of impact); and Smart taxes and public incentives (i.e. a favorable regulatory and enabling environment). By end of March-in the midst of the COVID-19crisis  the Joint SDG Fund received 258 proposals for supporting SDG financing interventions in over 100 countries  including LDCs  SIDS  and countries experiencing conflict and fragility (see this blog describing the SDG Financing Call).

The start of a decade of action to leave no one behind - nurses on the frontlines not only against the pandemic  but also our future for the Global Goals. Realizing the role of nursing in making the dreams of sustainable development into a reality by 2030. It took a pandemic for us to realize the importance of healthcare workers. Four years of nursing school taught mehow to serve mycountry. Yet  by the time a class of nursesgraduate  theysearch for greener pastures abroad. Why  you may ask? Because Filipino nurses are known to be extremely caring individuals. Being a nurse means more than being a mere assistant toa doctor. When you take away the heart of the hospital  you take away its functions. It is said nursing is a vocation  a calling for the most compassionate people there are no riches in this profession because giving back is the most fulfilling goal in life. But nursing is more than just that. Nurses can follow theirhearts desires and get the credit theydeserve at the same time. While nurses rally forsafety  fighting for the truth and eradicating the fake - as a society  we should all exert the same effort for our nurses.The people who risk years of practice and education only to sacrifice their lives for us. Stay at home  it can'tharm us if it won't be able to reach us! Florence Nightingale championed her environmental theory to what we use today to combat COVID-19. It was the year 1870  Florence promised that in the next 150 yearsthe world will value nursing. 150 years later  in the year 2020  we celebrate the International Year of Nursing and Midwives.

   Credits     SDG Global Festival of Action 2019   St. Johns University School of Law Student  Joint SDG Fund Intern  What are the key challenges that youth climate activists face? How are youth championing SDG 13 on climate action? What can the global community do to empower underrepresented voices? There are some of the questions posed at the Joint SDG Funds networking session  hosted in collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature One Nature  One Future Global Youth Summit held April 5-16  2021. The IUCN Summit brought together over 7 000 young voices from 120 countries to talk about issues in climate change  technology innovation  and rights and governance. In the SDG Networking Session  over 50 participants shared ideas on what frustrated them and what they hoped to achieve in their communities and beyond. A key theme was access to funding since financial limitations prevented ideas from being implemented. One activist from France asked the group about carbon neutrality and what it would really take to achieve that dream. In response  another participant from Pakistan shared his plans for a biofuel-based initiative as a sustainable energy source for the transport and environmental sustainability sectors. Global Youth Summit IUCN The group discussed the joys and challenges of working with people on the local and global level and how to really catalyze funding when access to corporations or large government entities seemed difficult or non-existent. Mentorship and networking also came up in the context of encouraging youth to participate. The group did not have all the answers  but we relished in the opportunity to talk with people who also valued environmental activism and had similar struggles  whether they were a hundred or a thousand miles away. The last question asked how individuals planned to contribute or pledge with respect to SDG 13 on Climate Action. A youth leader shared her plans to revitalize and beautify community parks in Delhi  India  by gathering community support and raising micro-funds. This local work  replicated in many other communities  represents the best of youth work. And by empowering our underrepresented voices in policy and action  the Joint SDG Fund is ready to work hand-in-hand with youth to create the sustainable future we hope to see., 13
 Local Pathways Fellow  United Nations SDSN Youth Renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving many of the SDGs. SDG 7  in particular  seeks to ensure universal access to affordable  reliable  sustainable  and modern energy for all. It further sets out to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. In 2020  the Covid-19 pandemic hit the globe. This pandemic and the isolation measures necessary to combat it have generated enormous changes and pressures on the health system  everyday life  and economic activity in countries worldwide. These changes also have the potential to impact countries achievements of Agenda 2030. Unfortunately  it has not been different for Brazil. Different sectors in Brazil are experiencing the effects of this pandemic  particularly the renewable energy sector. Brazil as a nation is known for its great share of renewable energy in its matrix in the industrialized world and as a driver for the use of cleaner energy resources. Bearing this in mind  it is therefore fundamental to investigate and work towards understanding the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic will have on Brazilian efforts to achieve SDG 7. The pandemic brought significant consequences for the energy industry at large  energy security and clean energy transitions. In the energy at large  the decline in economic activity due to several containment policies has deeply impacted energy demand. Most companies are losing substantial revenues as they are being hit twice: first by lower demand for their products and again by lower prices for these products. This situation however differs across sectorsfor instance  the residential segment had increased power use against a drop in educational and commercial buildings. For clean energy transition  all fuels except renewables are expected to experience their greatest contractions in demand for decades. The demand for renewables is expected to increase mainly because of 2 reasons due to their preferential access to many power systems  andbecause the low operating costs. Biofuels  however  are likely to see demanddecline  directly impacted by lower transport activity. Although renewable share is expected toincrease  a sustainable pathway calls for continuous efforts and commitment since cheaperfossil fuels can slow consumers' uptake of fuel-efficient vehicles  biofuels  and electric vehicles. Other than affecting countless lives  Covid-19 has also unleashed a devastating blow to theglobal economy  disrupting supply chains  choking off energy demand and shrinking down themarket for transport fuel. On a global scale  the overall global financial crisis may also lead to decreased investments in the renewable sector  harming attainment of SDG 7 on access to affordable  reliable and sustainable energy for all. Based on this reality  Brazil has designed an economic stimulus package. The design of this package is aimed at accelerating energytransition and achievement of SDG 7. An integrated approach tackling all these crucial issueswill not only have a positive impact on the countrys renewable energy availability  but alsoon other environmental fronts  such as climate change  air pollution  waste management and so on. It is the time to rethink our behavior towards our environment  so that a positiveimpact can come from such a bleak global episode., 7
 Programme Analyst  The Joint SDG Fund exists to close the loop between UN Country Teams  governments  private sector  and civil society to help stimulate collective action for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  At the Joint SDG Fund  we are aware that success relies on collaborative exchanges and knowledge sharing at all levels  and that reliable and inclusive partnerships are critical for long-term success. The Fund aims to forge paths and partnerships with governments  the academia  the private sector and civil society organizations to incentivize a scaled-up response to the SDGs at country level by promoting a government approach  by supporting collaboration amongst UN agencies and other development partners.  In the Republic of Congo  for example  the World Bank participates in the Steering Committee of the Funds joint programme  whose activities are aligned with the World Bank contribution to safety nets in the same locality. The lessons learned from the implementation of the joint programme will be rolled into the next phase of the World Bank Safety Net programme in the country. In Mongolia  FAO  ILO  UNFPA and UNICEF under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator of Mongolia  will deliver innovative solutions to extend social and health insurance to herders  and shock responsive social protection to strengthen the resilience of livestock livelihood. Joint partners  UNDP  UNESCO  UNFPA  UNICEF  UN Women and the Government of Brazil are building early childhood interventions by investing in a Happy Child Programme to accelerate the achievement of SDGs in Brazil. The implementation of the 36 joint programmes supported through the Funds call on social protection for leaving no one behindis led by 16 UN agencies  funds and programmes and two Regional Economic Commissions. The programmes are implemented through partnerships with 616 organizations  out of which 291 are national authorities and 192 civil society organizations. 41 private sector organization are involved across the 36 countries  and the joint programmes support 33 investments of International Financing Institutions. The World Bank acts as main partner in 17 countries. This focus on partnerships supports United Nations Resident Coordinators and Country Teams in the design and implementation of joint programmes that are context-specific and inclusive.

   Credits     Photo Credit: Lee Woodgate / Science Source   UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya Originally published on Business Fights Poverty here The number of coronavirus cases in Kenya has jumped to three after the government confirmed two more cases. President Uhuru Kenyattahas announced a raft of proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Barely three months into the COVID-19 outbreak  stock markets have plummeted  and global supply and production systems have wobbled. Across the world panicked shoppers have cleared shelves of hand sanitizer  soap and tinned food  as if preparing for a siege. Themessageby UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres that as we fight the virus  we cannot let fear go viral is absolutely pertinent. And the people of Kenya can count on the United Nations Country team as an ally in this fight. Global pandemics are the new threat to humanity. The number of new diseases per decade has increased nearly fourfold over the past 60 years and since 1980  the number of outbreaks per year has more than tripled. Factors such as climate change  rising populations and increased travel have made humans more vulnerable today than they were 100 years ago. An infection in one corner of the world can make its way to the most distant corner within a day. In sub-Saharan Africa  there are genuine fears over how health systems will cope. Most are ill-prepared and ill-equipped to implement public health measures such as surveillance  exhaustive contact tracing  social distancing  travel restrictions and educating the public on hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. These are the basic steps that will delay the spread of infection and relieve pressure on hospitals  even as support is sought for costlier solutions such as personal protective equipment  ventilators  oxygen and testing kits. For countries in Africa and other areas where health resources are limited  a little-understood pandemic such as COVID-19 is a challenge that requires a whole-of-society response. While science creates the tests and will eventually develop a vaccine  the most effective immediate responses to pandemics depend more on simple actions we can all carry out than on pharmaceutical-based solutions. Flattening the COVID-19 curve will also be aided by accurate information. Rising public panic and hysteria is stoked by the difficulty in sifting fact from rumour  speculation and inaccurate information. One of the problems of the age of social media and citizen journalism is that it provides a forum for everyone  and enables the dangerous fiction that anyone with an opinion is an expert. In such circumstances a rational  science-driven narrative is difficult to sustain. Getting ahead of COVID-19 by ensuring that only accurate information and scientific guidance takes control of the narrative is crucial. It is for this reason  the United Nations Country Team in Kenya is offering communications support  amongst other initiatives - to the Ministry of Health in its current commendable response to the problem. Everyone will benefit if they heed thewise counsel of CS Mutahi Kagwe. For example he emphasizes the importance of frequent and thorough hand washing. Hand washing saves lives and is the best defence against communicable diseases. Though microbes are evolving millions of times as fast as humans  and humans have little or no immune protection against new flu strains  the scientific understanding of the risk of pandemics  and our ability to predict the next pandemic before it even happens  is better than ever. It is now known  for instance  that most new infectious diseases originate in animals  including SARS from bats and some strains of influenza from birds. Factors that include close proximity to live animals  poor hygiene in relation to meat and live animals at markets  overcrowding  and bushmeat consumption can allow pathogens to jump the species barrier to humans. These scientific advances are being deployed to find more comprehensive solutions such as vaccines. Widespread access to such vaccines confer immunity to individuals and even herd immunity for populations. Vaccines work and have saved countless lives. Countries in Africa must also take the fight to the pandemic through simple but effective measures for detecting  testing  isolating and mobilizing their people to mitigate transmission. With simple  fact-informed hygiene measures as the main weapon  the continent can slow the viruss spread and flatten the curve. And the UN family in Kenya is in lockstep with the Government of Kenya to fight COVID 19 on all fronts., 3
 Sustainable Development Solutions Network Youth  Indonesia   Limited gains in gender equality and womens rights made over the decades are in danger of being rolled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic  (Antnio Guterres  2020) On April 5  the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for a global ceasefire to end violence types. It is also a call for us  the SDG Youth advocates  to pay extra attention to the violence issue  especially the gender-based one. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown response has put women at risk socially  economically  and politically  especially in the threat of gender-based violence. Many domestic violence victims are being trapped with their abusers while support for them is also inaccessible. Before the pandemic  the World Health Organization already indicated that 1 in 3 women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime. This number soared up to 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic  about 243 million women experienced domestic violence in the last 12 months. Youth as the largest groups of gender-based domestic violence victims Domestic violence is highly crucial to be seen in the youth perspective  as women in the 18 to 34 age group are seen to experience the highest rate of gender-based violence. Also  1 in 5 women who experience physical and/or sexual violence are the first to experience it when they were aged between 11 and 17. Bearing this in mind  this article discusses gender inequality as one of the main causes of domestic violence during COVID-19 that adversely impacts female youth  and our contribution as youth in implementing Sustainable Development Goal 5. The United Nations and some countries response to domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic Since 1981  October has been proclaimed as a month of  Domestic Violence Awareness . However  with every October that passes  domestic violence numbers remain unsolved. The immediate response by the United Nations to the soaring number of domestic violence worldwide is a collaboration of UN Country Teams and senior officials with the national governments to protect women and provide them with a recovery response. During COVID-19 in some countries like China  the hashtag #AntiDomesticViolenceDuringEpidemic was made with connectivity to the online source with the aim to end violence during the pandemic. An instant online-based messenger with geolocation detection feature has also been delivered in Spain to provide psychological support to the survivors. In France  20 000 hotel rooms have also been prepared for women who are experiencing domestic abuse to escape from their perpetrator. Colombia's government further provides access to virtual domestic violence services  which are also supported by legal  psychological  police and justice to the victims. These initiatives by various states show that indeed states are working towards solving the plight of domestic violence during COVID-19. Our role as SDG Youth Advocates Given that we as youth are stakeholders for the SDGs a pertinent question is how we can champion for SDG 5 and break the barriers of domestic violence during COVID-19. Betty Friedan wrote that cultural  societal and legal barriers are the main background problem of gender inequality and domestic violence. Our culture has further set up a misled perception that a good woman should be quiet  well-maintained  less complaining  with the ability to handle every issue completely in silence. Speaking up  for women in many parts of the world  is still considered taboo  rebellious  disrespectful  and violates the social norm. It is including to speak up about the domestic violence that they have experienced. This caused the perpetrator able to take advantage of this condition to commit domestic violence and women are forced to accept them in silence. As an SDG Youth advocate  this is the time for us to empower every woman in our circle of their equal rights with men and encourage the domestic violence victims to speak up and seek help.  It is our significant role as a youth to implement Sustainable Development Goals 5 with a start from ourselves. Let us start from our social media and circle to proclaim a call for speaking up with hashtag #WithHer  #HeForShe  #GenerationEquality and #MeToo for the victims during this COVID-19. We can encourage women to be brave to speak up about their abusive experience with the aim to strengthen other women to also break out of their silence and embrace their healing. It is the time to stand against the misconception in our cultural demand of staying silent in order to be a good woman. This is because a woman's voice is priceless and they have an equal human right as men to be embraced. They are neither a second-class figure nor a complementary of another gender. Every woman is the main driver of their story  and they are worthy of this role. A message should be proclaimed  that speaking up against domestic violence is not taboo  but keeping their abusive story themselves in silence  and letting the experience destroy their entire life is what should be considered as the new  taboo . Gender equality will thus only become a reality when all youth and stakeholders truly embrace this new taboo., 5
   Credits     UNDP in Belarus     The Sustainable Development Goals are a call to action for all countries to improve the well-being of all people without exception and to preserve the planet. The 17 goals build on the results of the Millennium Development Goals and include emerging topics such as climate change  economic inequality  innovation  sustainable consumption  peace  and justice. Belarus is one of sixty countries implementing programmes of such kind. In the Sustainable Development Report 2021  IMF estimates that the global need for additional spending on the SDGs is about 14 percent of global GDP a year by 2030. The program implemented by UNDP  UNICEF  UNFPA  UN Women and the Resident Coordinator Office in Belarus will allow to find new approaches to solving this challenge in Belarus. The goal of the program is to promote new financing tools for sustainable development with a focus on vulnerable populations. The UN agencies will implement their parts across various thematic areas with UNDP playing the coordinating role and working with other UN agencies on specific components to ensure continuity across SDGs. UNDP is also partnering with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection to conduct a finance assessment in the area of environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources (SDGs 12-15). A team of international and national experts will work together to analyze the existing costs and future financial needs to address environmental challenges in Belarus. Using the BioFin methodology  UNDP will analyze the financial resources allocated for issues related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity  develop optimal options for reallocating existing and attracting new sources of funding. Based on the findings of the assessment  it will be possible to introduce innovative methods of budgeting in the management of natural resources and environmental protection in Belarus and thereby contribute to the improvement of national environmental programs and practices. Within this programme UNFPA will support the healthcare system to improve efficiency of budget planning and spending. The agency will facilitate analysis  with special focus on reproductive health  and explore needs for services depending on gender. New approach will be based on emerging data and up-to-date scientific evidence. As a result  innovative cost-effective practices in the area of cervical cancer prevention  maternal health and gender-oriented budgeting will be introduced and piloted to track expenditures of budget resources in relation to the achieved outcome. Furthermore  UNFPA and UNICEF in Belarus have initiated joint consultations with the Ministry of Health on strengthening capacities of public authorities and healthcare managers. The aim is to discuss normative cost-based budget planning methods per consumer and opportunities for aligning budgeting with SDGs. Apart from that  these UN agencies are talking with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection on initiating dialogue for performance-based budgeting and capacity building for adolescents and assessment of the total volume and composition of budget allocations for children  adolescents  vulnerable families  and other vulnerable groups. Apart from that  UNICEF in Belarus is focusing on measuring the impact of public expenditures contributing to achieving child-related SDGs and conducting a quarterly survey of the needs of families with children to advance the methodology for measuring multidimensional child poverty (MDCP). Additionally  UNICEF in Belarus is planning to assess the performance of social assistance to families with children through the lens of MDCP and carrying out a study on measuring public expenditure targeting children (child budget) in three cities (Minsk  Borisov  Molodechno) by the end of 2021. Another agency  partaking in the joint efforts  is UN Women which works closely with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. Their goal is to strengthen the capacities of state employees to use gender-responsive budgeting tools in planning and budgeting. The agency plans to perform trainings and mentoring on gender analysis  promote the principle of equal rights and opportunities in development of state programmes. Besides UN Women will contribute to assessment of SDG indicators  disaggregated by sex  and work out specific recommendations in line with the National Action Plan on Gender Equality. In total  after the programme is finalized  Belarus will be equipped with technical capacity and tools to continue its transition to performance-based budgeting in the areas of health care  social services and natural resources  with a focus on the development of gender-sensitive and child-focused normative budgeting methodology. In addition  the Programme envisages testing the methodology of normative budgeting. Its implementation is expected to help increase the efficiency of public services provision by improving budget planning and spending. In addition  the proposed tools will have several positive effects  promoting economic growth  expanding social inclusion  improving environmental performance and management methods. Similar programmes have already demonstrated their effectiveness in a number of countries. For example  UN agencies and the government of Uzbekistan have published a report assessing financial flows for Sustainable Development Goals and identified opportunities for financing the SDGs so that funding  mostly private  reaches those regions and people who need it most. Belarus remains in the group of very high human development countries and ranks 24 in the SDG Development Index. Over the past year  the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on human development and  in particular  on achievement of SDG 1 (poverty eradication). After several years of successive reductions  extreme poverty increased in 2020. The slowdown in economic activity and global recession caused by the pandemic led to an increase in unemployment  affecting SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Under such circumstances  the introduction of innovative tools for financing the SDGs  as well as new approaches to the planning and use of budgetary funds focused on sustainable development are particularly relevant. The new Programme will assess the effectiveness of budget planning and spending and prepare recommendations for effective financing aimed at achieving the SDGs in Belarus.

   Credits     UN Women/Gustavo Stephan    In thepodcast episode of a Time to Act  Women in Leadership features an insightful discussion on the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Head of Joint SDG Fund Secretariat  Lisa Kurbiel interviews Graham Macmillan  President of Visa Foundation and Najada Kumbuli  Head of Investments at Visa Foundationon womens economic advancement and inclusive economic development. Gender equality and womens full and equal participation in all areas of life  especially decision-making  are integral to the Decade of Action. Indeed  meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 will only be possible when we recognize the value of women front and centre  together  leading the way and rising for all. With 400 million USD in assets and 200 million USD commitment over the next five years in both grants and investment capital  the Visa Foundation is advancing economic opportunity though philanthropy and investments in support of women entrepreneurs worldwide.  The discussion kicks off with an insight to the foundations commitment to gender equality. On this commitment  the President of Visa Foundation  Graham Macmillan emphasizes that when you invest in women  enterprises controlled by women and investment vehicles that are controlled by women there is going to be a tremendous amount of benefit that flows through.  The conversation then proceeds to discuss how the foundation employs different capital to advance gender equality. Najada Kumbuli  Head of Investments Visa Foundation provides that it is imperative to note that one form of capital cannot solve development challenges. At Visa Foundation we therefore employ grant capital as a vehicle to support women entrepreneurs and investment capital to provide these entrepreneurs with a just foundation to get to their next stages of business development. At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic  last year  the Visa Foundation launched a signatory initiative called the equitable access initiative. This is an initiative that has supported small and micro businesses access different forms of capital and different forms of services to grow and thrive. Visa Foundation has also put in place a five million investment in one of the most sustainable agriculture lenders in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa whose main beneficiaries are women small holder farmers. Whereas the Visa Foundation is focused on risk  return and impact  at the Joint SDG Fund  Head of the Joint SDG Fund  Lisa Kurbiel  highlights that the fund opens doors to de-risk and debunk risks. The fund is further cognizant of the systemic barriers that exist that bar women from sustainable participation in different economical spheres. At Visa Foundation  Najada Kumbuli notes that their commitment to gender diversity transcends to the organization internal structures such as leadership where gender and inclusion have been mainstreamed. The foundation also uses data to provide an integral view on gender equality progress. In Southeast Asia for instance  there was an accelerator program in which the data revealed that women businesses were earning less than they usually would have earned after participating in this accelerator program. This reality drove Visa Foundation along with other key stakeholders such as USAID and IFC to intervene by conducting research to see how to best address this growing concern. The foundation has further played a critical role in the advancement of gender equality in Vietnam. One of the success stories is a young woman entrepreneur who was able to start a wet wipes business with 5 women employees and has now grown her business to an enterprise with 300 employees. This young Vietnamese is changing the lives of women and families in Vietnam by empowering them to be self-reliant through her enterprise. It is fundamental to note that gender equality varies from place to place. However  despite this reality it is our fiduciary duty to make the most impact in the societies we live in and realize gender equality. Listen to Women in Leadership Podcast and learn more!, 5
   Credits     Cameroon - UN Women's Gender Road Project | PhotoUN Women/Ryan Brown   United Nations SDSN Youth and Co- Founder for Policy Act Initiative One in every six people across the globe is a young person. Taking a closer look at the African continent  there are over 226 million young people  aged 15-24 who make up one fifth of the worlds youth population. However  despite these statistics  according to the World Bank  youth account for 60% of the unemployed in Africa. Further  with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies and the job market in Africa this percentage can only be expected to rise exponentially. Youth unemployment is therefore a ticking time bomb that African states need to urgently address by building forward and retooling of African youth. In Africa  youth unemployment is caused by a number of factors. First  there is a skills mismatch between the skills youth have and the skills required by the labor market. With the digital revolution  many youth are inadequately skilled thus they tend to offer limited value to the labor market resulting in high unemployment rates. Furthermore  with the effect of the pandemic on the economies  the number of existing jobs vis a vis the number of young graduates has greatly plummeted. Moreover  for a number of the existing opportunities the experience required is often quite high for youth to attain. In addition  the states that face political instability provide a strained environment for youth to access employment opportunities. Bearing in mind these factors  many African states have put in place a number of interventions to address youth unemployment. These interventions range from policy interventions such as the adoption of the African youth charter to the programmatic interventions such as the institution of youth employment and internship programs to the financial interventions for example provision of seed capital for young entrepreneurs to finance their ventures. These interventions have indeed played a commendable role in addressing youth unemployment in Africa. However  going back to the statistics provided by the World Bank  more still needs to be done to address this ticking time bomb of youth unemployment. SDG Target 8.5 requires countries by 2030 to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value. In order to achieve this target with the current realities in the continent today  countries need to build forward and advocate for the retooling of African youth. Retooling of African youth means equipping them with the prerequisite skills  resources and knowledge to be able to garner employment opportunities and build forward in a digitally revolutionized post pandemic world. In order to retool African youth  a youth centric approach must be adopted. This is an approach which involves meaningfully engaging young people as instrumental stakeholders and not as mere tokens in the retooling process. For the retooling process  the labor market trends need to be critically analyzed to be able to identify skills required by the market and implement skills training programs for youth to be in tandem with the current labor market. Moreover  investments and encouragement of youths participation in agriculture is fundamental in not only addressing food security but also closing the unemployment gap. In addition  states should continue to promote innovation among young people and create incubation hubs to provide youth with mentorship  training and seed capital for their ventures.  However  this duty of retooling not only lies on the states but also on the youth. In order to address unemployment  youth need to take the initiative to enroll into skills building programs to retool their skills  to actively seek mentorship from experienced professionals within their reach and to be innovative and critical in their problem solving approaches in their communities.  Youth unemployment and the attainment of SDG Target 8.5 will continue to be a prevalent challenge in 2021. It is therefore up to us as a continent to build forward and to embrace collaboration in retooling African youth who are not only the leaders of today but also the leaders of tomorrow., 8
 Humanitarian Worker at Save the Children International Indonesia   It has never been so crucial to make education a universal right  and reality for all  - Audrey Azoulay  Director General of UNESCO Covid-19 has transformed many human lives and various sectors in the Government. The lack of preparation so that when a pandemic occurs in many countries is 'not ready' in handling it  including the education sector. The challenge also sprung up every day  so it took a quick and precise effort to tackle the problem.  The challenge in Education during Crisis In Indonesia  based on data from TheMinistry of Manpower Republic Indonesia that during the Covid-19 pandemic  as many as 2 million adult workers lost their jobs. Parents who lose their job will have an impact on the pattern of deprecation or children's lives  such as: Children do not get a decent educational facility because of the financial limitations. Children are vulnerable to child labor because they have to help parents meet the needs of the family  so that the child cannot study well. Children will also be vulnerable to have violence due to difficult family situations during a pandemic. This research results is in line with the UNESCO/Secretariat of the ministry of Education indonesia data Research  also stating that 60 million students who study from home during a pandemic will experience a decrease in literacy and numeracy skills  dropouts  and even child exploitation. In overcoming the challenges above  it is necessary to do a contractual approach in education so that the access to high education remains constructively fulfilled. YOU(th) Can be Involved in adopting a new approach to responding to COVID-19 The education sector needs to be fast-paced. In this period of transition  it is necessary to involve parents  students  teachers  society as an important group in the adoption of gradual housing as well as youth community to give an innovation and become accelerator. The strategies that need to be applied to speed up pandemic handling are as follows: Review the learning targets you want to achieve to rationally align with new situations and conditions in new normal. Identify the resources that need to be owned and held so that the new objectives that have been established can be achieved with the availability of existing resources. Mapping the situation and condition of each teacher and student who must be ready to perform a new learning model based on blended learning as designed. Explore the gap between needs and availability to develop strategic and operational measures that need to be done for bridging. Execution of these measures creatively and innovative by establishing various partnerships with external parties concerned about education with youth communities in the local area. The world faces significant challenges in addressing the immediate and longer-term effects of the pandemic on education systems. But the commitment of local and global education actors including youth  in finding new and innovative ways to deliver quality education should provide us all with a sense of hope. Crises showcase leadership. If the education practitioners  society and youth communities can come together and learn from each other about new ways of providing quality education (SDG 4)   it will emerge better equipped to help students thrive in a rapidly changing world and achieve the global goals by 2030., 4
  Joint SDG Fund consultant and former UN Official On March 3  2020  the Joint SDG Fund  the European Union Delegation to the International Organisations in Vienna  the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens and the OPEC Fund for International Development came together for a joint event and an interactive panel discussion on Mobilising to Advance the SDGs. The joint event was hosted by the EU and the European Commission in the prestigious Europe House in Vienna with the participation of more than 100 invited guests from the Vienna diplomatic community and civil society. The welcoming remarks were delivered by H.E. Ambassador DDr. Stephan Klement  the EU Ambassador and Head of the EU Delegation in Vienna  and DDr. Wolfgang Bogensberger  Deputy Head of the EC Representation in Austria.

   Credits     Awa and Georgina exchange cooking tips on the campsite.    Back in 2017  I spent a period of time on the Senegal-Mali border carrying out field research. We had a number of youths from the Dogon villages in Mali come work with us  and as we were there for a few months  we got to know them quite well. My most memorable conversation however was tinged with a somber note  it was about female genital mutilation (FGM). One of the girls  Awa  just 18 years old at the time  spoke frankly about how FGM was the norm in her culture  and how a girl would be rejected by the community if she defied the tradition. She believed that FGM was necessary to prepare girls for marriage and that it ensures premarital virginity by helping her resist extramarital sexual acts. As FGM is illegal in Senegal (not yet in Mali)  it is carried out without proper medical care  up in the caves  hidden from the rest of the village. Unfortunately  these harrowing stories are not uncommon in many parts of the world. There are an estimated 200 million girls and women alive today who have undergone FGM. In 2012  the UN General Assembly dedicated February 6th as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation  with the aim to amplify and direct the efforts on the elimination of this practice. Following the spirit of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 (Gender Equality)  the UN is striving for full eradication of FGM by 2030. A joint programme between UNFPA and UNICEF has been in place since 2008 is the largest in the world aimed at accelerating the elimination of FGM  focusing on 17 countries in Africa and the Middle East. Mauritania is one of the countries included in the UNFPA/UNICEF programme  given the high prevalence of FGM in women aged 15-49 at 66.6%. A new joint programme funded by the Joint SDG Fund Developing an integrated social protection model in the region of Guidimakha  Mauritania was launched in early 2020  with three UN agencies participating. One of the main targets for this programme is SDG 5.3: eliminate all harmful practices  such as child  early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. It will aim to use the UNICEF Community for Development (C4D) approach to develop community participation and to improve the knowledge of rights-holders and duty-bearers to change behaviors that affect childrens rights. Ideally this approach will contribute to eliminating FGM in Mauritania  as well as ending other harmful practices such as child marriage and gender-based violence. While FGM rates remain high Mauritania  Mali  and numerous other countries  advocates around the world are mobilizing against it. By creating programmes aimed at eliminating the practice the UN is raising awareness and empowering young women to speak up against FGM  leading the way to achieving gender equality and a more sustainable future. , 5

They are living in the village of Anjahamavelona  located at about 9 miles from the main city of Amboasary Atsimo. With her husband  they earn a living from subsistence farming.  Every single day  parents leave for work in the fields early in the morning - hard work that can barely cover their most basic needs. Their daily earnings cover food  school fees  and other family expenses. The periodic health care they must give to their 11 year-old son with a disability starts to weigh heavily on their budget.  Because of his disability  our oldest son starts to have some health issues. We then need to take him to the community health center every day to receive the necessary medical care. It is an additional burden on our modest budget. Added to the school fees of the three kids that we would like to keep paying.  mentionsBerthine Ma.  @MAROLAHY Dominique Nicole Taking care of both: the health care of my child with a disability and the education of my children Since Berthine Mas family moved to the village of Anjahamahavelona few months after the selection of the FIAVOTA cash transfer programme  beneficiarieswere not able to benefit from it. While we visited their village  she told us her dearest wish:  I would really love that one day  my family can benefit from an aid program taking in charge people living with a disability  but also a programme that can support family revenue so that we can keep sending our three children to school.  Social Protection Services adapted to the needs of different categories of people: The Joint SDG Fund Programme Our meeting with the family is particularly timely as we are currently in the preparation phase of launching an integrated social protection programme. Funded by the SDG Fund  the programme brings together four UN Agencies  UNICEF  UNFPA  WFP and ILOjointly working on social protection in Madagascar.The programme also sees the participation of other agencies including FAO  WHO and OHCHR.  The main objective of the programme is to provide an integrated package of social protection interventions specifically tailored to the needs of different categories of people  especially people living with disabilities.  The integrated social protection programme comprises the following components:  Cash transfer component  aimed at supporting the daily consumption of the most vulnerable households and the schooling of children (UNICEF);  Supporting the access of the poorest households to universal health coverage (ILO);  Agricultural insurance and productive activities (WFP);  A component supporting the fight against gender-based violence (UNFPA). Thanks to this joint programme  Berthine Ma's family  who has primary school-aged children and a child withdisability  if qualified and selected in the programme  could receive the necessary support to help give better care for herchildren.

There have been major steps taken to improve the social protection systems in place for the elderly  however the need to strengthen social connections is a dimension of ageing that has been under explored in public policy design. The general objective of this project is thus to increase social inclusion and protections for the elderly  through strengthening community networks and improving access to the various programmes  services and social benefits available to them              Learn more   Learn more, 5
   Credits     Photo by Agung Pandit Wiguna   Law Student Intern at Joint SDG Fund As American novelist and activist Pearl Buck wrote in her novel The Good Earth  the test of a civilization is the way it cares for its helpless members. Variations of this quote have often been inaccurately attributed to figures like Gandhi  but regardless of the actual source of these words  their truth is undeniably clear: the way we treat the most vulnerable people in society is of critical importance. As the global community grapples with the outbreak of COVID-19  the importance of protecting our most vulnerable becomes even more clear. I have been fortunate enough to work with the Joint SDG Fund  and other organizations across the United States and other countries  and see first hand their commitment to providing the resources and protection that people need now more than ever. Although now a lot of this work is focused on the current pandemic  it is not limited to it  and global efforts to help the most vulnerable will continue long after COVID-19 becomes a distant memory. In 2015  when the 2030 Agenda was formally adopted  the global community made a commitment to everyone to take concrete steps to make the world a better place for all of its inhabitants  and we intend to keep that commitment. A lot of the efforts highlighted now as a part of the response to the pandemic  like providing access to health care  and expanding social safety nets  are part of the work the Joint SDG Fund was created to support and fund. The current situation changes priorities in some cases  prioritizing healthcare and economic stability over efforts to innovatively solve traffic problems  the climate crisis or respond to different natural disasters  but it is still a time of hope  strength  and solidarity. Today  and every day  we must  as the UN Secretary General said  show solidarity with the most vulnerable. We do not know when this crisis will end  some predictions indicate it could last longer than a year  but when it does I hope we continue to show solidarity with the most vulnerable people. From this crisis  I  and many others  have learned the importance of collective action to protect the most vulnerable  and when this is all over  I hope we remember how important every single member of society is in combatting disasters  and how strong we are together. I hope that when we emerge from this crisis  the global community will join the Joint SDG Fund in continuing to emphasize the importance of protecting our most vulnerable citizens and working toward the sustainable development goals in order to create a better  stronger  and healthier world for everyone. _______________________________________________________________________________ If you would like to help fight the Coronavirus  your donation to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund will support critical work to prevent  detect  and respond to the Coronavirus., 3
   The Herder programme is one of the joint activities the ILO Mongolia and UNFPA Mongolia as part of the ILO-led UN Joint Programme (UNJP) Extending Social Protection to Herders with Enhanced Shock Responsiveness. The programme is the first nationwide social protection program ever developed for herders in Mongolia. It has the main objectives of improving herders life skills and updating their knowledge on livestock production. Moreover  it aims to set up a knowledge infrastructure to enable herders to access social-protection-related information with the ultimate goal of extending their social insurance coverage rate.  The two agencies joined forces and combined efforts to develop a solid and comprehensive nationwide program for herders. The significances of the joint activity lie in the shared resources to prepare local trainers in target provinces and support them in reaching out to herders and raise awareness on critical social issues such as social protection and reproductive health. The organizations share their knowledge  human skills  and financial resources to demonstrate the joint activity as an effective and efficient approach to extend social protection to herders nationwide.  The programme will be implemented in collaboration with the National Centre for Lifelong Education (NCLE)  using the organizations existing structure in all 21 provinces. The NCLE lifelong education trainers in 330 soums (provincial lower administrative unit) will be prepared as advocates and local trainers for social protection. They will reach out to herders and raise their awareness of the nine modules of the programme.   Modules of the Herder programme were developed by external consultants who are experts in the field. There is a handbook for herder and a methodological manual for local lifelong education trainers for each module. The following modules are included in the programme package: Introduction to livestock dairy production and technologies Introduction to wool & cashmere production and technologies Introduction to tan production and technologies  Introduction to meat production and technologies Introduction to benefits of herders social insurance coverage  Introduction to governance and performance of Herder cooperatives Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Prevention of Gender-based violence and substance abuse Soft skills Before the programs official launch in November  ILO and UNFPA organized validation workshops of the programme in Khentii and Zavkhan provinces to pilot the programme with local lifelong education trainers and collect their feedback. In Khentii province  the workshop was held between 27-28 September for modules 1-6. A total of 21 local trainers attended the workshop. In addition  five herders were invited to participate in and share their experiences and provide their feedback on the manual. In Zavkhan province  the validation workshop took place between 20-21 August for modules 7-9. Local trainers from 24 soums were trained on the modules and provided teaching aids to use during their training for herders.  The NCLE consultants are currently reflecting the input and recommendations from local trainers and herders and tailoring their needs and requests for the final version. Following the programs official launch in November  ILO Mongolia and UNFPA Mongolia will formally hand over the programme to the NCLE to further implement it in 21 provinces of Mongolia. , 13
   Credits     UNFPA/Luca Zordan    The following op-ed by UN Under-Secretary-General Mark Lowcock  Natalia Kanem (UNFPA) and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka (UN Women) was published online today byThe Telegraph: Anyone who thinks weve come close to achieving gender equality is kidding themselves. The COVID-19 pandemic has helped reveal the full extent of gender inequality while creating a set of circumstances that threaten to reverse the limited progress that has been made. Women who have been displaced from their homes whether through conflict or natural disaster are especially vulnerable. Everyone who is serious about gender equality and womens rights must speak up. Then those with the means to do so need to back up their words with funding. The cracks appeared at the start of the pandemic. Reports of intimate partner violence skyrocketed as women were trapped with abusers in their homes  tents or refugee camps. Venezuela reported a 65 per cent increase in femicides in April 2020 compared to the previous year. In Iraq  calls reporting gender-based violence  mainly domestic violence  increased by 40 per cent after the outbreak of COVID-19. The UN projects that every three months of lockdown could bring an additional 15 million cases of gender-based violence globally. The threat the pandemic poses to womens rights and freedoms goes beyond physical violence. It is undermining their economic independence and pushing millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic affected access to antenatal and postnatal consultations  safe childbirth and newborn care. Stocks of contraceptives ran out as they were deprioritized and procurement chains became disrupted. Opportunities evaporated. As businesses shuttered and economies nosedived  millions of womens jobs were wiped out. Women already doing 76 per cent of the worlds unpaid care work saw their care duties increase dramatically. A third of the worlds schoolchildren  more than 460 million students  remain cut off from education. Many girls currently unable to go to school will never go back  especially if they have become pregnant in the meantime. Falling household incomes  protracted school closures  and risks associated with displacement put adolescent girls at a higher risk of child marriage and female genital mutilation. Already one girl in five marries before she is 18. But lets be clear. The virus cannot be held responsible for the state of gender equality and gender-based violence. People are responsible for that  mostly  but not exclusively  men. Behavior  values and attitudes are at the root of the problem. There are no simple answers to these problems. But there are several things we know do work. Making a financial investment in womens and girls rights and opportunities works. Having women in decision-making roles works. Funding supports centers which help women protect themselves from violence. It gives them access to health  psychosocial and legal services. It helps victims and survivors of gender-based violence get justice. It helps give women access to family planning. It helps get girls into school. Yet the needs of women and girls in humanitarian settings continue to be overlooked and underfunded. Too many women and girls are still deprived of lifesaving services. Today we have released $25 million from the UNs Central Emergency Response Fund to tackle the pandemic of sexual violence. This is not enough. We need everyone to join the effort. Wealthy nations who help fund the UNs humanitarian work tell us theyre focused on ending gender-based violence. Yet to this day their funding for this is far less than what is required. The benefits far outweigh the cost of investment. At least 70 per cent of health workers and first responders are women. It has been the shelters and helplines run by womens organizations that have been the primary support for women in most countries. It is a smart investment  as global studies suggest that every dollar invested in women and girls generates a significant return. For example  every $1 spent on contraceptive services saves between $1.70 and $4 in maternal and newborn health care costs in humanitarian crises. At the start of these 16 days of activism against gender-based violence we urge governments to prioritize the needs of women and girls in their COVID response and recovery efforts  and to make sure women themselves are driving the decision-making process. The choices we make now matter. We can only plot a successful path out of this pandemic if we do not leave half the population behind. Originally publish on OCHA, 5
   Credits     Ezra Kipruto   SDG Coordinator  SDSN Youth The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) defines food security as physical  social and economic access to enough  safe and nutritious food that meets dietary needs and food preference for an active and healthy life at all times. It is well known that agriculture plays a key role in the prosperity of every nation  however in Kenya and Africa  the sector is at a crossroads. Young people lack interest in the sector leaving the country with manpower difficulties  jeopardizing Kenyas and Africas food security and economic prosperity and the continents progress. Kenyas population is growing rapidly  however statistics show that while the average age in Kenya is 19 years  the average age of a Kenyan farmer is 60  which raises doubts as to whether the country can be food secure when its most active population is not willing to participate in food production. It is therefore critical for todays youth to be engaged and empowered to embrace agriculture and nutrition. This starts by addressing the perception that agriculture is associated with academic failures and retirees. Governments need to invest in sensitizing and promoting awareness of the importance of Agriculture and highlighting the roles that everyone can take towards becoming food secure. Furthermore  the development community needs to invest further in financing models that ensure youth are also empowered to come up with innovative solutions to ensure food security and make available any other resources necessary for successful farming. With the current digital revolution in Africa  Kenya is ripe to utilize technology  which offers an opportunity to attract youth to agriculture through digital platforms and innovations such as social media  apps  robotics  IoT and artificial intelligence. These digital platforms can also be used to spread knowledge  build networks  and reduce farmers costs in market access and information gathering while increasing their profitability. Young people have the potential to solve several issues faced by farmers such as poor and fluctuating prices in the markets  the existence of middlemen who take advantage of the farmers and huge losses incurred due to bad weather. It may be an uphill task to change the mindsets of millennials about agriculture  but it can easily be realized by 2030. Africa boasts the youngest population and some of the most fertile lands globally and therefore enough resources to feed its people. Young people are therefore the missing mark to end hunger  achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture., 2
   Credits     Sustainable Development Goal 4   Student at University of Rwanda College of Business and Economics Education is one of the powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. When ensuring quality education for all  there is a need for states to pay keen attention to the education of children who live in rural areas especially in these unprecedented times. Taking cognizance of this reality  I conceptualized an idea in an effort to safeguard quality education in my country Rwanda. On 16thMarch  the government of Rwanda closed all public and private institutions of learning due to COVID-19. They went farther to encourage the employment of a home-based learning initiative to support remote learning for over 2.6 million children during the period of lockdown  and called on all partners in the education sector to support this initiative  with a view of minimizing the impact of lockdown on the education system. For this learning initiative scripts for radio broadcast lessons and television lessons were developed. Born and raised in rural Rwanda  I began to think of how children from rural areas like myself were coping with no access to radios and television sets. Many of these children who viewed education as an essential tool to help them achieve their future goals could no longer access it due to limited access to technology. The parents of many of these children were also up in arms as many of them could not afford to support their childrens education through this new home-based learning initiative. Bearing the above in mind  I founded an initiative dubbed Education Asylum in pandemics. This initiative seeks to advocate for the right to education for children from rural areas during COVID-19. We provide families in rural Rwanda with radios  data bundles and printed learning materials in a bid to ensure that these children are still able to continue their education. We also summarize some of the live radio sessions and television lessons into printed learning materials which we then share with these children. Appolinaire Tushyime in rural Rwanda in May 2020. Gilbert F. Houngbo  President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development  said that in Africas rural areas  children tend to help their parents with farming activities  and it could be positive in the current circumstances. However  he warned that such practices may increase child labor  and harm young peoples education if it continues long term. The danger is that once this crisis is behind us  the risk of some of the children not going back to school becomes even higher. There is therefore an urgent need for more initiatives like mine to be developed for children in rural areas. COVID-19 is now more than ever leading to greater gaps in the education system. This is the time therefore for us as SDG advocates to amplify our voices and take action to ensure that no child is left behind and that every child attains quality education. Together we can champion for quality education of vulnerable and marginalized children during COVID-19., 4
