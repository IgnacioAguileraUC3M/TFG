 Make cities inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable
More than half of the worlds population now live in urban areas. By 2050  that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people  two-thirds of humanity. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces.
The rapid growth of cities in the developing world  coupled with increasing rural to urban migration  has led to a boom in mega-cities. In 1990  there were ten mega-cities with 10 million inhabitants or more. In 2014  there are 28 mega-cities  home to a total 453 million people.
Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces  and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas. Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing  and upgrading slum settlements. It also involves investment in public transport  creating green public spaces  and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive.
Sustainable city life is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.

 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all
Since the creation of the Millennium Development Goals there have been historic achievements in reducing child mortality  improving maternal health and tackling HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and other diseases. In 15 years  the number of people newly infected by HIV each year has dropped from 3.1 million to 2 million and over 6.2 million lives were saved from malaria. Since 1990  maternal mortality fell by 45 percent  and worldwide there has been an over 50 percent decline in preventable child deaths globally. 
Despite this incredible progress  AIDS is the leading cause of death among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa  and 22 million people living with HIV are not accessing life-saving antiretroviral therapy. New HIV infections continue to rise in some locations and in populations that are typically excluded or marginalised.
Chronic and catastrophic disease remains one of the main factors that push households from poverty into deprivation. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) impose a large burden on human health worldwide. Currently  63% of all deaths worldwide stem from NCDs  chiefly cardiovascular diseases  cancers  chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. The cumulative economic losses to low- and middle-income countries from the four diseases are estimated to surpass US$ 7 trillion by 2025. Additionally  there continues to be underinvestment in the social circumstances and environmental factors affecting health. The job on HIV and health is far from done.
Recognizing the interdependence of health and development  theSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an ambitious  comprehensiveplan of action for people  planet and prosperity and for ending the injustices that underpin poor health and development outcomes.
SDG 3 aspires to ensure health and well-being for all  including a bold commitment to end the epidemics of AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and othercommunicable diseases by 2030. It also aims to achieve universal health coverage  and provide access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as well as expanding access to affordable medicines.
Promoting health and well-being is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.

 End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half  from 1.9 billion in 1990  to 836 million in 2015  too many people are still struggling to meet the most basic human needs.
Globally  more than 800 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day; many lack access to adequate food  clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid economic growth in countries like China and India has lifted millions out of poverty  but progress has been uneven. Women are disproportionately affected; they are more likely to live in poverty due to unequal access to paid work  education and property.
Progress has also been limited in other regions  such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  which account for 80 percent of the people living in extreme poverty. This rate is expected to rise due to new threats brought on by climate change  conflict and food insecurity.
TheSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a bold commitment to finish what we started  and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. In order to achieve the SDGs  we must target those living in vulnerable situations  increasing access to basic resources and services  and support communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.
Ending poverty is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across multiple goals.

 Build resilient infrastructure  promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Sustained investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities  mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important  as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.
Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges  such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries  and investing in scientific research and innovation  are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development.
More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet  and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge  and as a consequence foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
Investment in infrastructure and innovation is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for progress across the multiple goals.
