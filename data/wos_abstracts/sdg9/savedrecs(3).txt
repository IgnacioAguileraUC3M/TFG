TI New Housing Concepts: Modular, Circular, Biobased, Reproducible, and
   Affordable
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB For a moment, it seemed that the architect had disappeared from the construction supply chain for sustainable and affordable housing provided by Dutch housing associations. Large contractors were making direct agreements with housing associations and wanted to scale up production with their housing factories. However, with the 'So You Think You Can BUILD' challenge, architects, consultancies, and contractors reinvented themselves within the construction supply chain and acquired a position as providers of circular building concepts. The aim of this challenge is to stimulate providers of homes to design and produce (in great numbers) affordable and sustainable houses. This not only scales up building production in empty fields but also within difficult and dense build urban areas. A whole new generation of Dutch architects, consultancies, and contractors working in collaboration are now intensively involved with circular and biobased residential buildings, innovative materials and production processes. They are managing to provide attractive products for housing associations and other clients. In the first part of 2021, 'So You Think You Can BUILD' challenged teams of designers, engineers and contractors to develop new concepts, with the three winners applying the principles of the 'passive house', which is modular and circular, as well as a smart building skin and smart core with open floor space in between.

AB Housing is important since it provides security, privacy, neighbourhood and social relations, status, community facilities and services, access to jobs and control over the environment. To enable everybody to afford a house, affordable housing was introduced and developed throughout the world. But there's an issues with current affordable housing development, especially the sustainability of these affordable housing, especially from environmental aspects. Several initiatives have been done to improve current sustainability, but current initiatives lack of spatial indicators to assess the sustainability level, from environmental aspects. This study focus on assessment of sustainability level from environmental aspect. The assessment method consists of 3 main components; the green space availability, proximity to water features, and proximity of flood areas. The results show that most of the affordable housing in this study area was less sustainable in term of environmental aspects. From this results, proper planning and development to sustain the affordable housing surrounding area can be done by government, or other stakeholders in the future.

   housing
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The present research aims to investigate the insights of housing providers on potential benefits of sustainable affordable housing. Housing providers need certainty on the benefits of sustainable affordable housing for homebuyers. We used a cross-sectional survey questionnaire consisting of 23 benefits of sustainable affordable housing administered to 121 experts from the housing industry. In total, 82% of the housing professional respondents believed that sustainable affordable housing offered all 23 benefits included in the survey. The first five main benefits were an increase in the comfort of homeowners, the enjoyment of natural ventilation, a reduction in water bills, a reduction in electricity bills and an increase in housing values. An exploratory factor analysis returned 5 components: environmental, energy, social, cost and status. The findings provide insight into the drivers of sustainable affordable housing. A framework for the benefits of sustainable affordable housing was developed. The results will be useful for policy-makers, developers, place managers, housing associations and academics attempting to increase the supply and demand of sustainable affordable housing.

TI MARKETING, MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL PROVIDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
SO MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB Today's rising housing prices in most countries worldwide have caused increasable attention to the problem of affordable housing. It is a social or ethical issue and an essential economic direction. Thus, affordable housing has great potential, influencing economic growth, labor forces, innovation, sustainable development, and an inclusive economy. Systematization of informational sources, theoretical and practical approaches for providing affordable housing, and assessing social housing needs indicated many views on this problem among scholars and policymakers. That is why marketing, management, and financial providing of affordable housing are significant mainstreams. The research aims to investigate marketing and management fundamentals of providing affordable housing in connection with funding aspects based on cross-country analysis. For achieving this target, key trends o f housing market segmentation were analyzed, considering the distribution of the population by tenure status and analytical house price indicators using the data of the statistical office of the EU, the World Bank, and the OECD. The ways to promote more affordable housing by public and local authorities, private investors in affordable housing, and specific social and affordable housing market organizations were described. Main organizational forms of providing affordable and social housing were also characterized. Particular attention was paid to strategic planning for affordable and social housing, especially housing business plans or affordable housing strategy development as a priority step in marketing, management, and financial providing affordable housing. A SWOT analysis for affordable housing developments was used to show strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the affordable housing market. To empirically confirm some relevant strengths, the impact of indicators of financial providing of affordable housing was formalized based on correlation analysis (calculating Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients with time lags based on results of Shapiro-Wilk testing) and construction of Arellano-Bond linear dynamic panel-data regression model with checking the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions (the sample from 25 EU countries for 2011-2019) using the Excel 2010 and STATA 14.2 software. The dynamic model made it possible to consider the share of affordable housing owners with mortgage or loan or the share of tenants, rent affordable housing at a reduced price or free. The value of GDP of the previous period affects the current situation (due to introducing lag variables and using instrumental variables or the generalized method of moments (GMM) to obtain adequate estimates). The hypothesis that an increase of 1% of the share of affordable housing owners with mortgage or loan causes the rise in GDP per capita of an average of 0.44% with a two-year time lag was empirically confirmed. An increase of 1% of the share of tenants, rent-free housing or affordable housing at the reduced price, causes the decrease of GDP per capita of an average of 0.5% with a two-year time lag. It was substantiated that governments should continue and improve their policies for financing social and affordable housing. At the same time, they should prefer affordable mortgage lending programs over programs of reduced or free rental housing. The results of this research confirm the significant drivers of policies and practices devoted to affordable and social housing, such as marketing, management, and financial providing.
   The presented recommendations are useful for scholars interested in this scientific field of research, public and local authorities, investors in affordable housing, and specific affordable and social housing organizations.

TI What is determining affordable housing shortages in the Greater Kuala
   Lumpur, Malaysia?
SO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of the affordable housing shortage in the Greater Kuala Lumpur from the suppliers' perspectives.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Primary data were collected through a cross-sectional survey questionnaire comprising 21 determinants and 111 experts in the housing industry.
   Findings
   The affordable housing shortages are consequences of regulations and policies on land allocations, building materials and the affordable housing market. The government should provide more lands to the developers or the government should directly build affordable housing on their lands. To lower the cost of construction, the government should reduce the importation tax and procedures, and the housing industry should find alternative building materials.
   Originality/value
   Theoretically, the research provided fresh insights into the causes of housing shortages and reasons for the increase in housing prices. The results will be useful to policymakers towards affordable housing delivery and to the developers and contractors on measures to increase profit margins and increase housing supply.

TI Study on micro-mechanism of the affordable housing community in urban
   renewal the case of Zunyi city, Guizhou province
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Introduction: Affordable housing in China refers to housing with social security for low and middle income people under the unified planning and coordination of the government. In the process of urbanization, the construction of affordable housing and commercial housing should be developed in parallel, but under the role of the real estate market economy, the development of the two is unbalanced, resulting in a disparity in quantity, a large gap in quality, unreasonable management, and even residential segregation. The construction and development of China's affordable housing community is a huge and complex systemic project. This study focuses on a series of problems in the relationship between supply and demand of affordable housing based only on the development context of urban renewal at this stage.
   Methods: Based on existing literature and official data, combined with field visits and research, this study uses Vensim PLE software to build a system model for converting various types of stock into affordable housing, and to investigate the effect of various policies on solving the problem of supply and demand of affordable housing.
   Results: The research results show that 1) the policies stimulate the increase of urban population and help promote the supply cycle of affordable housing; 2) under the stimulation of the supply policy of converting stock housing into affordable housing, social investment will improve by 33%-64% and the gap of affordable housing will decrease by 29%-58%; 3) under the stimulation of the policy of optimizing the management of affordable housing, the coverage rate of affordable population will improve by 3%-5% and the middle and low income households' per capita housing floor area will increase by 9%-18% l; 4) under the comprehensive influence of the combined policies, the urban population will grow healthily, the per capita income and per capita housing floor area of low- and middle- income people will be improved, the stock of housing will be reduced, the number of affordable housing will increase, the affordable housing gap will be reduced, and the affordable housing community will be developed sustainably and healthily.
   Meaning: The research results and recommendations will provide references for the government and competent authorities to enact or update the policies on affordable housing.

TI An appraisal of the early impact of COVID-19 on affordable housing
   finance in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION
AB Purpose Affordable housing provision is one of the visions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), as highlighted in Vision 2030. For about 21 months now, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ravaged the world and has increased the level of economic crisis and financial uncertainty to achieve planned projects. Studies investigating the reality of how the COVID-19 pandemic may streamline the chances of achieving affordable housing for all in 2030 are scarce. Thus, this study examined the relevance of affordable housing, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on affordable housing and proffered measures to promote affordable housing finance in Vision 2030. Design/methodology/approach Medina, Riyadh and Al Qassim were the participants' cities engaged via panel interviews and supported by existing relevant Vision 2030 documents. The Delphi method was adopted to explore the government officials, financial operators (bankers), academicians and employees' opinions, and the analysed data presented in themes. Findings Findings show that SA Vision 2030 blueprint expresses an exemplary country in all ramifications, including affordable housing finance for the citizens. Findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic threatens SA affordable housing finance Vision 2030. The increased housing shortage, high construction housing cost, increased foreclosures, increased eviction, possible homelessness, financial instability and vulnerability emerged as the perceived impact of COVID-19 on affordable housing finance in Vision 2030. Refinancing housing loans to boost Vision 2030, forbearance to promote Vision 2030, improve payment relief, among others, emerged as measures to promote affordable housing in the post-COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications The research only identified the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on affordable housing finance in Vision 2030 and proffered policy solutions from the engaged participants' perspective. Also, the study covered three cities (Medina, Riyadh and Al Qassim). The suggestions that will emerge from this research may be adopted to address other sectors captured in Vision 2030 that are critical and hit by the ravaging pandemic. Practical implications Measures such as refinancing mortgages and strengthening government housing agencies will promote affordable housing for Vision 2030 if the relevant policymakers and mortgage institutions are well implemented. Originality/value This research identified the perceived early threats from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect affordable housing transformation in Vision 2030 from the participants' perspective. Studies regarding COVID-19 and affordable housing in Vision 2030 are very few.

This paper uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the main determinants of private organizations' participation in affordable housing in Hangzhou, China. Our results show that both internal factors (such as value identity, sense of responsibility, profit-seeking tendency, herd mentality, size of organization and knowledge, and experience) and external factors (such as legal system, project profit, policy incentive, financial support, and supporting facilities) significantly impact the participation of private organizations in the construction of affordable housing. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.

TI The ends required to justify the means for sustainable affordable
   housing: A review on critical success criteria
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In this time of increasing housing demand and incessant housing supply deficit, the need for critical success criteria (CSC) to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the performance of affordable housing projects has become even more relevant. Though affordable housing has received much attention in the construction industry, success in affordable housing is interpreted differently by different researchers and is an abstract term difficult to be assessed. Besides, limited studies exit on providing a framework for assessing success in affordable housing projects. This paper aims to review the literature on CSC for affordable housing and based on the outcomes develop a framework for measuring success in affordable housing projects. To this end, CSC-related papers were retrieved from Scopus and the Web of Science databases. A systematic desktop search was employed, which culminated in the selection of 34 articles related to CSC for both general construction and affordable housing projects. Based on the literature, 20 CSC for sustainable affordable housing were identified and used to develop a conceptual framework of product success, project management success, and project success. Practically, the findings of this study could help architects, project managers, and planners monitor and control affordable housing projects to ensure successful delivery while also serving as measuring criteria to assess performance of affordable housing projects in meeting households' needs. Theoretically, this study offers an important acumen to the existing literature on CSC for affordable housing and provides useful findings for further empirical studies.

AB The rural-to-urban migration in India has been pretty rapid over the past few decades. Providing affordable housing with sustainable infrastructure will always remain a challenging task for engineers and architects. Prefabrication entails walls, foundation stones, and other units of construction, which are manufactured in bulk, transported to the location of the building, and simply 'fixed' on site which can be used to build modular and affordable housing in India. Contrary to common belief, prefabrication is not a new construction process but one which has been used extensively and widely for many years. Furthermore, as this study demonstrates, this process is not exclusively based on high technology approaches but is, in fact, appropriate and advantageous in building affordable housing. This study seeks to determine the feasibility of prefabricated techniques in the context of affordable housing in urban areas. The study compares a double storey prefabricated affordable housing model with a conventional housing model made out of brick and concrete on the grounds of economic and sustainability considerations. The results of cost analysis revealed significant cost reductions by practising prefabrication in construction. It is found that prefabrication in construction is an economic and sustainable practice that could cater the needs of providing affordable housing in the current scenario of urbanization in India.

TI Appraising the nexus between influencers and sustainability-oriented

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The emergence of a plethora of innovative construction methods, materials and technologies in the construction industry has been projected to enhance the effective delivery of sustainable affordable housing. However, a lack of empirical evidence buttressing an extensive analysis of the effect of internal and external influencers on adopting these innovations within the affordable housing context in developing countries persists. This study examines the nexus between company and project characteristics as internal influencers, and challenges as external influencers, on the extent of use of sustainability-oriented innovations (SOIs), on affordable housing projects. Variables emanating from an extensive literature review were presented in a causal model detailing sustainable, innovative, and affordable housing (SIAH). The model and the inherent causality between the constructs were validated through a survey administered on a population of registered South African home developers. The results of structural equation modelling posit a minimal positive impact of internal influencers and moderate negative effects of external challenges on the extent of use of SOIs by home developers. Also, results highlighted the negative mediating impact of challenges on the relationship between internal influences and the extent of use of SOI in affordable housing projects. The study concludes that the external challenges are the key drivers of adopting innovation in SIAH, and by addressing these challenges, the extent of use will significantly improve. The validated causal model can be used as a framework to enhance SOIs adoption in SIAH.

TI Measuring Sustainability Elements in PR1MA Affordable Housing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND

AB Housing has become a vital instrument in daily life, not because of the cost and function's only but housing can provide other attributes of a feasible urban life. Thus, Malaysia's government has struggled to cater affordable housing to counter economic concerns and adopt a sustainable housing development aspect for a better quality of life. However, even the housing affordability of low and middle-income earners has been improved, but some of them are remains in debating. The objective of this paper is to measure the sustainability element in PRIMA affordable projects in Malaysia as well as to determine the satisfaction level of sustainable affordable housing practice among PR1MA residents. The data were collected from 97 survey forms distributed amongst PR1MA residents through Google form and self-administered and were considered as useful data for further analysis. The results show that only social and environmental elements were determined as sustainability elements in PR1MA affordable housing in selected PR1MA projects in Malaysia. Moreover, the results revealed that majority respondents have low satisfaction level on economic sustainability in sustainable affordable housing practice within their residential area. Thus, this result has a significant contribution to the stakeholders who are directly or indirectly participated in affordable housing development and specifically PR1MA projects. This result also helps the policy makers and practitioner for emphasizing several important elements for developing affordable housing in future.

TI Lessons for LEED (R) for Neighborhood Development, Social Equity, and
   Affordable Housing
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) for Neighborhood Development (LEED (R) ND) is a rating system designed to encourage sustainable development. I explore why and how most LEED (R) ND projects ultimately fail to meet the equity goals inherent in sustainability. I survey 114 LEED (R) ND accredited professionals (APs) and conduct 20 interviews with LEED (R) ND APs to illuminate the role of the rating system in developer decisions to include affordable housing in their projects. I also explore why nonprofit developers see value in seeking LEED (R) ND certification for their projects. Although a limited sample, it provides insights into how the certification process affects developer decisions. I find that the LEED (R) ND rating system does a poor job of encouraging developers to provide affordable housing: Only 40% of LEED (R) ND-certified projects include affordable housing. LEED (R) ND APs do not feel that the system offers sufficient incentives to overcome the risks and costs of providing affordable housing. Nonprofit developers might pursue LEED (R) ND to create savings for residents, but may be deterred by the cost of certification. Most respondents feel that the affordable housing credit should be increased and improved to provide adequate incentives to developers.Takeaway for practice: Planners cannot count on LEED (R) ND certification to ensure the provision of affordable and mixed housing in sustainable neighborhoods. The LEED (R) ND system could be improved by weighting the affordable housing credit more heavily; developers could also be incentivized to build a greater mix of housing. The certification costs could be lowered or subsidized for projects with affordable housing and assessed on a per unit basis. Additional credits could be given to projects that significantly reduce utility costs for low-income residents.

AB housing is one of the most important issue for very one and often is the largest single household expenses. It is basically more than a shelter which combines environment and life style and facilitate people access to the services and work opportunities. Besides, housing is considered a major item in public budget and major pubic investment are needed to create, maintain and services residential areas (ARA,2011). This study focuses on affordable housing area which tries to provide shelter for low-income population of a society. The study tries to present a model to evaluate the satisfaction of three different stakeholders in affordable housing market as: society/ government, residents and company which provides affordable housing services. The model will be implemented later in three different countries: Finland, Poland (city of Warsaw) and China (city of Wuhan). Therefore this study also presents the current situation of affordable housing system in those mentioned countries.

AB One of the biggest challenges that face the development in developing countries now a day is Informal settlements. The phenomena of informal settlements urban sprawl is increasing each day, destroying cities, degrading quality of life, and eradicating urban fabrics. Which created a vital need to find new sustainable solutions for upgrading informal settlements in developing countries. One of the different approaches is affordable housing.
   Affordable housing is rarely discussed in relation to informal settlements upgrading. Although affordable housing introduces many new strategies in order to grantee low priced housing and upgrading techniques. Also, it is applicable for developing countries, since developing countries' governments cannot afford to fund all informal settlements upgrading projects.
   This research aims to explore the relationship between affordable housing and upgrading informal settlements. To achieve this aim this paper will highlight the definition, impact, and strategies of affordable housing. It will also explain what informal settlements are. Then analyze two relevant examples. Through comparative analysis to analyze affordable housing policies applied in the examples upgrading program. In order to prove that affordable housing policies may be a use for upgrading informal settlements in developing countries. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Examining spatial pattern and location choice of affordable housing in
   Beijing, China: Developing a workable assessment framework
SO URBAN STUDIES
AB Little research is devoted to evaluating the spatial patterns of affordable housing in Beijing. For filling this gap by developing a workable assessment framework, this paper addresses the importance of assessing the spatial patterns of affordable housing, not only for the wellbeing of low- and middle-income households but also for urban sustainable development, and presents Beijing as a case study. Using GIS-based spatial analysis, this study assesses the spatiotemporal dynamics of location and affordable housing in Beijing from 1999 to 2012. We posit that spatial agglomeration is gradually decreasing, and the spatial patterns demonstrate an equilibrium distribution in this urban area. The hypotheses were tested using three indexes, Lorenz curves and data on 294 affordable housing projects within the Sixth Ring Roads in Beijing. Our analysis demonstrates that affordability patterns are obviously spatially clustered, and affordable housing is mainly located at the urban fringe. The direct cause is that low- and middle-income households have little impact on determining the location of affordable housing. Therefore, clustering pattern should be reconsidered and improved when constructing future affordable housing projects in Beijing.

TI The Link Between Local Comprehensive Plans and Housing Affordability A
   Comparative Study of the Atlanta and Detroit Metropolitan Areas
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: I question whether the strength of affordable housing policies in local comprehensive plans is associated with better affordable housing outcomes, which I measure as a decrease in the share of low-income households who spend more than 30% of their income for housing, otherwise known as cost-burdened households. I first assess the strength of affordable housing policies in 58 local comprehensive plans, counting the number of-and degree of coercion in-those affordable housing policies. I then analyze the relationship between the strength of affordable housing policies and changes in the share of low-income households with cost burden. I find that the strength of affordable housing policies is higher in the Atlanta (GA) metropolitan area than in the Detroit (MI) metropolitan area. I also find that the strength of affordable housing policies is positively associated with a decrease in the share of low-income households paying more than 30% of their income for housing in the Atlanta metropolitan area. I do not find a comparable relationship between plan strength and housing outcomes in the Detroit metropolitan area. I also find that the state role matters: Georgia provides more support and guidance for local comprehensive planning, and for affordable housing policies in those plans, than does Michigan.
   Takeaway for practice: Planners should continually promote local comprehensive plans that include more and stronger affordable housing policies and advocate for greater state support for comprehensive planning and affordable housing policies because these appear to lead to a greater likelihood of implementing stronger plans.

TI A Critical Success Factor Framework for Implementing Sustainable
   Innovative and Affordable Housing: A Systematic Review and Bibliometric
   Analysis
SO BUILDINGS
AB The actualization of affordable housing remains a challenge. This challenge is exacerbated by the increasing societal demand for the incorporation of sustainability principles into such housing types to improve levels of occupant health and well-being whilst avouching the desired levels of affordability. Innovative technologies and practices have been described as beneficial to the effectuation of sustainable affordable housing. However, knowledge concerning the deployment of innovative technologies and practices in sustainable affordable housing (sustainable, innovative, affordable housing-SIAH) delivery remains nascent. Consequently, there is a lack of a common ontology among stakeholders concerning how to realize SIAH. This study aims to contribute toward the development of this body of knowledge through the establishment of the critical success factors (CSFs) for effective SIAH implementation. To achieve this objective, a systematic review and bibliometric analysis focusing on a juxtaposition of sustainable, innovative and affordable housing concepts was carried out based on the relevant literature. This led to the identification and clustering of CSFs for these housing concepts at individual levels and as a collective (SIAH). The findings of the study consisted of the establishment of four distinct yet interrelated facets through which SIAH can be achieved holistically, namely, housing design, house element, housing production method and housing technology. A total of 127 CSFs were found to be aligned to these facets, subsequently clustered, and conclusively used for the development of a SIAH CSF framework. The most frequently occurring CSFs with predominant interconnections were the utilization of energy-efficient systems/fittings, tenure security, a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, affordable housing price in relation to income and using water-efficient systems/fittings CSFs, and establishing the emergent SIAH CSF framework. The framework in this study is useful in the documentation of SIAH features for construction projects and further studies into SIAH CSFs.

TI How affordable housing becomes more sustainable? A stakeholder study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Rapid urbanization poses a significant challenge of accommodating the poor, particularly in developing countries such as China where affordable housing has only been initiated a few years ago and will continue to be developed in the coming years. Two major considerations in affordable housing programs are cost and time, as the ability to meet the needs of low-income households is the main target of these programs. However, it is not a common strategy to address affordable housing shortage by means of incorporating sustainability features. One of critical issues is the lack of sustainability framework to integrate sustainability in affordable housing. This paper aims to identify the key sustainability performance indicators (KSPIs) which are useful to guide the development of affordable housing. A preliminary list of 42 key sustainability performance indicators of affordable housing was identified through an extensive literature review. This was followed by a questionnaire survey to solicit the professional views from three stakeholder groups, namely government, developers and academics in the Chinese construction industry. Via the fuzzy set theory and variance analysis, 24 KSPIs were finally highlighted. These findings provide useful references for policy makers as well as industry practitioners to develop affordable housing programs in a sustainable manner. This helps to achieve the sustainable development at the regional scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI LEED as a tool for enhancing affordable housing sustainability in Saudi
   Arabia The case of Al-Ghala project
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to enhance sustainability in affordable housing in Saudi Arabia within an effective locally adopted sustainability assessment tool by discussing the multi interdisciplinary concept of sustainability in the built environment and introducing environmental indicators which are recently developed to foster environmentally responsible practices. The study aim expands beyond proposing sustainable feasible alternatives for existing affordable housing project in Saudi Arabia, namely, Al-Ghala project, to appropriating the measuring tool itself to make the review process easier, faster and more effective.
   Design/methodology/approach - Al-Ghala project, a typical affordable housing project is selected to act as a case study for this research. The housing units are assessed according to LEED to obtain the overall evaluation which obviously reflects the quality of the project sustainability. Elements that negatively affect the score and suggested feasible remedies are then identified, as well as inapplicable and inappropriate LEED components. The data were complemented by observation, interviews with occupants and project management team, monthly consumption rates of water and electricity, in addition to computer modelling and analysis by Ecotect and Green Building Studio.
   Findings - Sustainability in affordable housing requires a holistic framework that promotes environmentally responsible practices including design, construction and management phases. LEED provides evidence that it can considerably contribute in enhancing sustainability of post-occupied affordable housing units by identifying points of weakness that lead to inefficient use of energy, water and materials; paving the way for a wide range of sustainable modifications. In addition, for LEED to be competent in Saudi Arabia a native version needs to be developed in which local circumstances are taken into consideration.
   Research limitations/implications - According to the wide range of subjects covered by LEED, some elements could not be measured in depth. Impact of modifications proposed for LEED needs to be tested further.
   Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of feasible environmentally sensitive affordable housing in Saudi Arabia.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study how affordable housing can be made sustainable.

TI Community Land Trusts for Sustainably Affordable Rental Housing
   Redevelopment: A Case Study of Rolland Curtis Gardens in Los Angeles
SO CITYSCAPE
AB Community land trust (CLT) affordable housing projects are typically built in rural or economically depressed urban neighborhoods. In the midst of urban housing shortages and anti-gentrifcation organizing, local groups are turning to the CLT model to redevelop affordable housing in expensive urban centers and enable low-income households to remain in their communities and maintain access to jobs, services, and cultural amenities. This case study focuses on the synthesis of skills and strategies it took for a land trust and an affordable housing developer to join forces and transform 48 units of Section 8-funded apartments with expiring affordability covenants into 140 units of sustainably affordable housing. In addition to increasing the number of affordable units, most critically, the CLT's ground lease design will help ensure their affordability indefnitely, unlike mainstream affordable housing projects. This study also identifes public policy changes that could facilitate similar projects and discusses the enduring challenges associated with the development of affordable housing in expensive market economies.

TI Critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Interventions for sustainability attainment in affordable housing have received increasing attention from policy makers globally. However, policy-makers' interventions for sustainable affordable housing markets can be inefficient and even counterproductive. As such, among the diverse interventions available, a vital question is what are the potential efficient interventions? To address this question, the views of affordable housing experts (also knowledgeable in sustainable housing) around the world were solicited via a questionnaire survey to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing. Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs. The research findings seek to inform policy-makers on the CSFs for efficient resource utilization for sustainable affordable housing market. Future study would establish a relationship between the CSFs and success criteria for sustainable affordable housing.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB For a significant thrive towards sustainable development globally, sustainability attainment in affordable housing for low-income earners is fundamental. Identifying obstacles to sustainability attainment is primal to successful policy implementation. This study aims to identify critical barriers (CBs) to sustainable affordable housing (SAH) from an international perspective. To this end, 26 barriers were identified from comprehensive literature review and empirical questionnaire survey was conducted with 51 affordable housing experts from various countries around the world. Factor analysis on identified CBs revealed five components: green retrofit-related; land market-related; incentive-related; housing market-related and infrastructural-related barriers. Moreover, rank agreement analysis of the components showed high agreement levels on 'incentive-related barriers' and 'housing market-related barriers' between experts from developing and developed countries. The research findings are relevant to policymakers and practitioners in adopting tactical measures for worldwide SAH. Besides, the identified CBs serve as recommended set of barriers for further empirical study to unearth local variations and context specific barriers to SAH in most countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As Penang Island is rapidly being developed and urbanized, it brings to an issue of a growing urban population which resulted in a lack of suitable land for urban housing development on the island. Such a scenario has pushed up the land use density and values that leads to a concern about an increase in the price of houses and insufficient provision of affordable housing in Penang Island. This is due to the fact that their income does not qualify them to purchase from the affordable housing schemes. Coupled with the increasing cost of urban living, the issue of affordable housing affects the sustainability of urban living of the affected families. The main objective of this paper is to explore and identify the issues and challenges faced by the urban families in Penang Island pertaining to affordable housing ownership. To achieve this objective, 30 heads of urban households were interviewed through an semi structured interview method. They are urban families in Penang Island that are selected through purposive sampling technique. Direct observations were also carried out to understand more about the living style of these families and their current living conditions. Subsequently, the qualitative data collected were analysed using content analysis technique. Briefly, this study found out that the main issues and challenges faced by the urban families in Penang Island are expensive pricing of houses, lack of affordable housing choices, high urban living costs, difficulties to obtain bank loans and low income. These issues and challenges, if not taken into serious consideration by the relevant parties, will affect the wellbeing of the families and sustainability of urban living on the island.

AB The Urban population of India registered a growth of 32 percent, rising from 285 million to 377 million from 2001 to 2011, and by 2050, 900 million people will be living in Indian cities. This will put a huge stress on urban planners to grow an infrastructure. In this paper, we examine the Government of India's programs for affordable housing in India and tenure form initiatives that have impacted the housing sector in India as there was a dramatic policy change in 2016. These policies have the potential to lead more transparency in the housing sector, which will affect the housing market in the short and long-term for home buyers. The policies that affect Indian real estate is Goods and Services Tax, Modification to the Benami Transactions Act, Real Estate ( Regulation and Development) Act 2016, construction of affordable housing 100% deduction of profit, change in arbitration norms for construction companies, interest subsidy for first-time home buyers, exemption of service duty for affordable housing construction, DDT exemption for SPVs to REITs, and demonetization are discussed with the present situation due to a different change in taxation by government.

TI THE IMPACT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ON SUSTAINABILITY IN GULF
   CITIES
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB The recent construction boom has led to new urban development dynamics in Gulf cities driven by real-estate speculations and large infrastructure investments. While in the past affordable housing for medium income migrants and their families was integrated within the fringes of old downtown areas and compound developments in the suburbs, recent investment patterns have led to an increasing challenge of these economically highly engaged social groups to find residences. In recent years, a newly emerging trend in the Gulf region has been the establishment of large scale mass housing projects as new dormitory settlements to address the growing demand for affordable housing. This paper presents an overview of current development patterns by exploring two major affordable housing projects and their impact on sustainability in Doha and Dubai. This is undertaken by establishing a preliminary assessment framework that involves relevant sustainability parameters. The assessment reveals the major differences between both projects and their impact on environment, economy, and society.

TI Thermal comfort perception in naturally ventilated affordable housing of

SO ADVANCES IN BUILDING ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Indoor thermal comfort is critical to building sustainability besides improving occupants' health, well-being and productivity. However, the applicability of the existing comfort standards within different climatic conditions and contextual settings is often in question. This study presents the findings from a longitudinal thermal comfort study conducted in low-income affordable housing in Mumbai, India. Surveys were conducted in three distinct seasons within a warm-humid climate. The linear regression method yielded a mean neutral temperature of 28.3 degrees C and a wide comfort band ranging from 24.6 degrees C to 32.2 degrees C indicating high thermal adaptation among the occupants. The preferred temperature was found to be 26.3 degrees C. Adaptive comfort standards, ASHRAE and the National Building Code of India prescribed a narrow range of comfort and were ineffective in predicting comfort conditions within affordable housing units. The role of income in shaping comfort expectations was established, lending support to the economic dimension of comfort. The results would be helpful in providing design recommendations for the future affordable housing stock and the development of an adaptive comfort model for vulnerable low-income communities.

TI Exploring the Severity of Factors Influencing Sustainable Affordable
   Housing Choice: Evidence from Abuja, Nigeria
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB It is a shared global experience that a house which is already expensive will become even more costly. This experience is partly because housing supply has always failed to satisfy demand. In many developing countries, the issues of affordable housing supply center on shortage and poor distribution. Recent studies on this subject reveal that distribution-related problems can be addressed through choice reconciliations. Therefore, understanding how housing affordability problems affect housing choice enables a broader interpretation of the issue. Thus, critical in housing policy making and implementation, as well as towards sustainable development/delivery of affordable housing programs. In Nigeria, housing choice has never been investigated, neither has it been studied within the framework of sustainability. It is not a common strategy to incorporate sustainability into the concept of affordable housing choice. However, integrating sustainability into the concept of affordable housing choice allows for the introduction of wide-ranging and broader criteria such as environmental and social factors, which are routinely neglected in housing choice literature. Therefore, this study aims at filling this literature gap by identifying the determinants of sustainable affordable housing choice (SAHC) in the study area. The purpose is to establish the severity of the identified factors based on respondents' perception and discuss the agreement levels amongst the three respondent groups. Regarding this, a comprehensive list of 43 different factors contributing to SAHC were determined through a systematic literature review. Based on which a survey of 83 affordable housing applicants, 102 and 69 residents of affordable housing estate and shantytown respectively, was performed. Through statistical analysis, results reveal that the factors affecting SAHC cuts across economic, social and environmental dimensions. Also, there is an agreement (correlation) by each group and the overall ranking of all participants. The tests confidence level for all inferential statistics was 95%, which implies 0.05 level of significance. These figures indicate that the data were obtained from the same population and points to the relatedness of factors identified. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the 43 different factors were narrowed down to seven. The study findings show that "Housing price in relation to income" and "rental price in relation to income" are the most severe factors with relatively high overall scoring, which is consistent with similar studies in this domain. However, it was uncovered that respondents placed high priorities on other non-economic factors like security (safety), housing location and building type. The study presents an interesting topic, usually unexplored in the field of decisions and public policy. It argues that at present, the housing affordability concerns and affordable housing choice determinants in the study area cannot be restrictedly defined in economic terms. Our findings build on previous studies and reiterate the need to consider a broader view towards affordable housing problem. It offers salient information to stakeholders and real estate companies, which could aid sustainable development/delivery of housing projects that are affordable.

AB Sustainable development and affordable housing are some of the challenges Malaysia and many other developing countries are experiencing. Majority of the population which comes from the middle-income group found difficulties in purchasing an affordable house and living in sustainable communities. Hence, in response to the Malaysian government's effort in the Eleventh National Plan (2016-2020) for every Malaysian to have equal access to affordable housing with sustainable approaches, the drifts of integrating affordability criteria in sustainable housing development seems vital. It is essential to simultaneously tackle sustainability and affordability housing issues. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in achieving Sustainable Affordable Housing Scheme from the economic, environmental, and social perspectives for the middle income group. This study examines issues based on a comprehensive review of journal articles and official reports. Relevant literature resources on the CSFs of sustainable affordable housing to meet the needs and ensure satisfaction of end users are reviewed. It is expected that the findings will elicit several strategies for the construction industry players to enhance the quality of life for sustainable communities via the Sustainable Affordable Housing Scheme.

CT Sustainable Built Environment (SBE) Regional Conference
CY 2016
CL Zurich, SWITZERLAND
SP SIEMENS
AB Egypt suffers from a severe shortage in affordable housing. The government's main approach to the problem is to subsidize the affordable housing developments. As the available financial resources are very limited, this approach cannot cope with the size of a growing problem. Recently, the government announced that hundreds of thousands of units are planned. Yet, these - when built - will hardly cover the new demands leaving untouched the accumulated deficits of past decades. This paper propagates a new approach to address the problem. The approach aims to provide sustained developments of affordable housing units without the need for government subsidies. This is to be achieved by making the development of these units a profitable investment for the private sector. The approach is based on viewing the developments of affordable housing units as a development of a community with a variety of needs. These needs create values that allow businesses to make profit. The approach is supported by two supplementary ideas. The first is a decentralized green infrastructure for the development. The second is to make use of the Egyptian culture in term of social responsibility. The paper explains the approach and its supplementary ideas. It also shows the results of a financial study that proves the feasibility of this approach.

AB Affordable housing has become a dream to millions in the world today. Depletion of natural resources together with the increasing price of building materials has aggravated this issue. Sustainable construction is a technological practice that involves the effective utilization of local man power and locally available renewable resources in construction with the help of minimum infrastructure. Alternative technologies which eliminate or rather minimize the utilization energy intensive materials such as concrete, cement and steel form an identity of sustainable construction. Cost Effective and Environment Friendly (CEEF) technological options practicing in the state of Kerala, India is also considered as a sustainable construction practice focusing on affordable housing solutions in the State. This paper presents an overview of CEEF technologies and checks the sustainability of these technological options in the context of Kerala.

TI A Methodological Framework to Foster Social Value Creation in
   Architectural Practice
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The building industry is essential for a national transition towards a circular economy (CE) in Denmark. The Danish state subsidises the Danish affordable housing sector, which is the largest single sector within the Danish building industry, making the sector an essential driver for the transition. The social components of sustainability are considered crucial to ensuring the quality of the environmental and economic components of the CE. However, social value creation (SVC) has been neglected in building processes, and public investments are being used without the policymakers thoroughly assessing the CE's socioeconomic efficiency and effectiveness. The sector therefore needs integrated methodologies to support comprehensive decision making on the CE during construction and renovation. SVC is an apparent field for architectural firms. Two surveys were conducted among business and sustainability managers of Danish architectural firms to identify the challenges and potentials regarding assessing sustainability and SVC in architects' practices. The results of the surveys are described and analysed in this study. Several impact categories, indicators and tools are identified, discussed and summarised in a methodological framework that can support architects in decision making about SVC in constructing and renovating affordable housing. Further refinement of the framework to support dynamic and iterative decision-making is anticipated as future work.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING: A REVIEW OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED
   SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB This paper aims to examine the current sustainability assessments of affordable housing in Malaysia by reviewing existing tools used in project development. In line with global concerns on sustainable development and advancement in the development of tools accessing sustainability, Malaysia has also implemented similar green assessment systems such as Green Building Initiative (GBI), Green Real Estate (GreenRE), the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Low Carbon Building Assessment, etc. The scope and focus of each are somewhat different, with each of these targeting specific types of building or development sectors; but none has been developed to suit the requirements of high-rise low-income or affordable housing. Indeed, this is a special sector considering its circumstances of low budget and thus limiting itself in resource utilization and construction implementation. This paper argues that there are inadequacies in the existing sustainable assessment systems with regard to the special requirements of the high-rise affordable housing sector. In this paper, we will discuss these issues and highlight some of the inadequacies. Data derived mainly from a content analysis of policy documents and news reports. Examples and data focusing on Penang state are featured. The findings are part of a study in developing a framework of sustainability assessment for high-rise affordable housing in Malaysia.

AB This article evaluates the Global South housing policy for low-income earners by utilising the Nigerian example to analyse public housing policy strategies used to provide housing to low-income earners. The materials employed in the study were housing policy programme documents provided by various ministries that are linked to housing between 1991 and 2020. The housing policy documents were subjected to qualitative content and thematic analysis. The analysis of the selected housing policy documents showed seven key policy strategies that are intended to strengthen affordable housing development. These strategic themes are funds, schemes, governments, implementation, development, land, and rurality. The findings indicated that the existence of housing policy strategical themes does not translate to affordable housing development and housing affordability for low-income earners, though the effective activation and implementation of strategical themes will promote affordable housing development.

TI Is affordable housing a pro-poor policy? Evidence from a prominent
   housing policy in Iran
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB This paper examines if affordable housing as a representative of planning serves the pro-poor policies or is used as a means against the poor. To this aim, Mehr housing, as the most significant and costly affordable housing planning practice in Iran, is studied by conducting a comprehensive review of 65 different related studies and using data-driven coding, with results compared with other contexts. Findings are classified into four main categories entitled "production and reproduction of poverty," "money participates rather than individuals," "the construction of shelters rather than residential environment," and "unsustainable affordable housing developments." Considering the relationships between categories and comparing them with experiences in other contexts indicate that affordable housing planning serves as an anti-pro-poor policy using the poor as means, not ends, for the salvation of state and/or society. This process ended in sweeping the poor into formal informalities. Reorientation of power and relying on local settings are pathways for planning to serve pro-poor policies.

AB Safety of residential area has become major concern in urban area, especially in affordable housing area, with several safety measure was implemented. Several Governments also developed safe city program, focusing on preventing crime index. Several initiatives were conducted to assess safety, including Safe City Index 2019, Safe City Program, Defensible Space Concept, crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED), Smart Sustainable Cities, etc. Some of these initiatives focus only on crime, other focus on step to improve safety and other model that are broader focus but not specific to safety. Besides that, these models are less emphasis on the aspects of spatial assessment especially the safety level assessment based on affordable housing location in Malaysia. This study focuses on integrating spatial information and analysis to improve current initiatives, and come out with conceptual model to spatially assessing safety level of affordable housing in Malaysia. This conceptual model consists of 6 main indicators; crime, safety and security, infrastructure security, accessibility, natural disaster, and health security. With proper assessment model, further planning to improve current safety can be taken by government and affordable housing community.

TI Feasibility of zero-energy affordable housing
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The United States needs comprehensive policymaking reforms that promote sustainable residential development. This study investigates the feasibility of statewide, zero-energy affordable housing by analyzing historical data on the climate, energy use, and solar system costs in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The hypothesis examined is the net present cost of implementation of rooftop residential solar systems to achieve zero-energy, multifamily buildings of the U.S. Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is lower than the discounted present cost of energy of otherwise identical buildings that run without renewable energy generation systems. We propose a generalizable framework for analyzing the feasibility of achieving regionwide or statewide zero-energy affordable housing. To validate the framework, we employ a longitudinal sample of monthly energy use data from 2013 to 2016, obtained from 310 residential units of 15 LIHTC developments across Virginia. Based on statistical regression analysis, energy simulation, and simulation-based risk analysis, we find that the net present value of investments in zero energy affordable housing can be positive with a low risk. The investment value varies often depending on the zero-energy building definition, weather characteristics, retail price of electricity, and incentive rate. The results suggest that many other southern states can accrue benefits from zero-energy affordable housing.

SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB With the growing worldwide demand for affordable housing and the importance of supporting and stimulating sustainable development, the need for sustainable solutions in the affordable housing sector is at a peak. The present paper screened about 75 construction technologies and assessed 46 of them. The present paper presents the first results of a step wise approach to identify, assess and recommend most promising technologies for affordable housing projects. A database was developed to store detailed technical information about each of the technologies. A grading and ranking scheme was developed to identify the most promising construction technologies from a sustainability perspective. The main challenges for affordable housing production and most relevant assessment indicators were identified from the literature, interviews and meetings with experts. An indicator based assessment system was developed by cross-referencing the identified eight challenges with ten selected indicators. The final ranking demonstrated that a wide variety of technologies perform strongly overall, and these range from bio-based materials, such as bamboo and timber, to industrialized technologies, such as concrete. Moreover, the possibilities for improvement are vast, and the option of combining different technologies seems to be the most promising approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to relatively primitive construction methods and insufficient relevant design experiences, resource and energy waste is still a major concern in Chinese affordable housing in recently years. Assessing basing on the information of the currently available technology and construction method, it is unlikely that the above issue can be resolved in the next a few years. Therefore, it is imperative to introduce a new affordable residential typology named Chinese Skeleton Infill - CSI housing. After studying the inherent characteristics of this new supportive housing typology, it is believed that it can effectively improve the current situation with energy and resource consumption. It is believed that the CSI housing can be suitably applied in affordable housing project and bring social and economic significance.

AB Studies on specific critical success criteria (CSC) for performance measurement of sustainable affordable housing projects are limited. This study aims to identify and classify the various CSC from the views of affordable housing experts around the world. 21 CSC were identified from a comprehensive literature review followed by a questionnaire survey on the identified 21 CSC. With 51 responses, the data were analyzed. Factor analysis indicated that the various CSC can be grouped into six components: household satisfaction CSC, stakeholders' satisfaction CSC, house operation cost CSC, time measurement CSC, location affordability cost CSC and quality-related CSC. Practically, the findings of this study can serve as a guide for assessing the performance of affordable housing projects as well as serving as a guide to developers, NGOs and government agencies in the allocation of resources for the provision of sustainable affordable housing. Future study would investigate the interrelationship between critical success criteria and critical success factors for sustainable affordable housing.

Increasingly local communities are engaging with the possibility of direct provision themselves and discussion around this notion has profound implications for community cohesion. One community-based solution gaining popular support within communities, and with government ministers, is the Community Land Trust mechanism. This involves control and ownership of land to help ensure affordable housing is built and remains affordable in perpetuity for the community. The language and difficulties with definition of terms, together with the complexity of engaging relevant stakeholders in a changing policy and legislative framework can be problematic. This may lead to apparent lack of consensus within communities on the way forward. Perceptions of local housing issues and ways to address them are sometimes vague, sometimes diverse but rarely apathetic. This paper includes data from two case studies in North East England, which are examined using interviews with key players, as a means of seeking some practical solutions.

AB World population is growing at a rapid pace which has caused a tremendous housing shortage. This in turn leads to over exploitation of natural resources such as iron ore, lime stones, alumina, etc. This has resulted in exponential increase in the prices of conventional building materials. Also the production of these materials causes the degradation of environment due to the production of greenhouse gases. To resolve this menace, recent researches have been focused on developing sustainable infrastructure. Numerous innovative techniques have been showcased by different researchers recently, highlighting the potential of bamboo based construction for sustainable infrastructure. However, for onsite construction these innovative techniques have still not been widely used to develop affordable housing. This study focuses on the available techniques and the hindrances affecting the mass usages of such techniques to develop affordable housing. An overview on the benefits and shortcomings of different components such as bamboo reinforced beams, bamboo reinforced columns, bamboo arches, bamboo reinforced walls are also analyzed here for affordable housing. It was observed that such bamboo based structures have great future prospects for developing affordable housing as they are cheap and have considerable strength. However, issues such as bond stress, chemical treatment, size, shape, species, age, moisture content, etc. which affect the bamboo performance have still not been standardized through guidelines. Therefore, there is an immediate need to standardize structural bamboo through effective guidelines for its wide application.

AB Housing policy is an important policy concerning national economic sustainable development and the harmony and stability of society. With the reformation of housing system in China, housing problems of low-income families have become increasingly obvious. As the effective policy to solve the housing problems of low-income families, China has gradually established social security housing system since 1990s, mainly including affordable housing, low rent housing and housing fund. The security system has solved the housing dilemma to some degrees; however, it shows a lot of problems such as the lack of capital investment, the insufficient implementation of local government and so on. This paper first reviews the evolution process of affordable housing policy of China, then through analysis framework of social policy elements put forward by Chambers and Wedel to analyze the affordable housing policy of China. Based on this, we introduced the policy network theory and researched the interactive games between the actors in the policy network and benefit relationships in the network, deeply exploring the problems and causes of affordable housing policy. Then we made proposals and recommendations to the further improvement.

TI Evaluation on the Internal Public Space Quality in Affordable Housing
   Based on Multi-Source Data and IPA Analysis
SO LAND
AB Much affordable housing has poor accessibility to external urban public space facilities because of its suburb location, which makes the residents' daily life and social activities mainly depend on the internal public space of the community. Such affordable housing needs urgent upgrading of the internal public space based on the thorough understanding of the low-income residents' demand ranking. The internal spaces' transformation will significantly improve the living environment and the quality of residents' life, and it also provides a way to promote social equity and sustainable urban development. By using the multi-source data and the two-step floating catchment area method, this paper selects typical affordable housing, which has poor accessibility to external urban public space, as our case study. After establishing the evaluation index system, IPA (Importance and Performance Analysis) is used to calculate the quadrant value of each index so as to clarify the upgrading urgency indexes from the residents' demand for internal public space of affordable housing. Studies have shown that tables, chairs and pavilions, pedestrian systems, retail commercial facilities, medical and health facilities, and recreational space have the strongest urgency for upgrading; fitness facilities, exercise space, barrier-free access, guidance signs and parking lot design are the next most urgent indexes; Recreational facilities, entrances/exits of the residential area, green space in front of t residential buildings, and cultural facilities all have general urgency for upgrading.</p>

TI The Coupling Coordination Evaluation of Sustainable Development between
   Urbanization, Housing Prices, and Affordable Housing in China
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB For the past few years, China's urbanization process has been in a state of rapid and variable development. With many migrants flowing from rural to urban area, the change in the urban structure and the trend of the economic development has led to a rapid development of the real estate market. However, the conflict between the migrants and the local low- and middle-income groups in respect of demand for basic housing has become a concern. Based on Chinese time-series data from 2008 to 2018, this study establishes an evaluation indicator system to consider the influence of urbanization, housing prices, and affordable housing and analyzes the comprehensive development level and coordination relationship using the methods of range standardization, entropy weight model, and coupling coordination. The results show that the comprehensive development levels of housing prices and affordable housing are both in a state of fluctuating growth. From 2008 to 2018, the coupling degree between urbanization, housing prices, and affordable housing was high, while the coupling coordination degree between the three subsystems increased from reluctant coordination to satisfactory coordination; this clearly shows that the relationships between urbanization, housing prices, and affordable housing are mutually coupled and promoted. Furthermore, based on the coupling coordination relationships between the three subsystems, this study discusses the sustainable development of urbanization and provides some suggestions for regional government. The conclusions have practical significance for China and other developing countries to coordinate housing prices and affordable housing in the process of rapid urbanization.

TI Sustainable Affordable Housing Strategies for Solving Low-Income Earners
   Housing Challenges in Nigeria
SO ESTUDIOS DE ECONOMIA APLICADA
AB Globally, several studies have affirmed that the population of those who are displaced with respect to housing is on the rise. Developing nations in the continent of Africa to include Nigeria are reportedly not spared of this development. Similarly, the low-income earners have been reported as the worst hit of this global menace. Shanty dwellings, squatter settlements and informal settlements have similarly been reported to be homes to low-income earners who constitute over 90% of the population of Nigeria. This study therefore presented sustainable affordable housing strategies as an emerging concept through which low-income earners housing challenges in Nigeria can be eliminated. The study relied on a systematic review of literature to arrive at its findings. Findings from the study revealed that sustainable affordable housing strategies through which Nigerian low-income earners housing challenges can be addressed can best be explored from the social, economic, environmental, institutional and technological components of sustainable affordable housing. The study calls on the government, stakeholders, policy makers as well as private developers to adopt sustainable affordable housing strategies for low-income housing provision in Nigeria. The study's outcome will contribute to existing body of knowledge in that it will provide useful information with respect to low-income housing provision and equally re-direct research interest on low-income housing in Nigeria and other developing nations.

AB Houses are the basic human need. It has been one of the priorities of the Government of India (GOI) right from the First Five Year Plan till date. Government has provided various fiscal incentives to promote housing on both, the demand and supply side. Since independence, a large number of schemes have been launched but target of affordable housing for all has not been achieved. What can be done to make housing more affordable? For the owner-occupied sector, lack of affordability is a problem for Lower Income Groups (LIG) and Middle Income Group (MlG) in most of the cities of the country. However, this paper shows that excessive affordability is not a problem in small cities unlike metropolitan's cities. Till now the main concerns are metropolitan's cities and this paper argue that small cities are often neglected with respected to affordable housing. If we ignore our fast growing small cities now, which are potential metropolitan cities, then the future may become more critical in terms of providing affordable housing to inhabitants of these cities. The Government is concern on metropolitan cities as compared to small cities, which has to be change for a balanced and sustainable future urban development.

TI Temporal optimization for affordable and resilient Passivhaus dwellings
   in the social housing sector
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Scarcity of affordable energy efficient dwellings is a defining characteristic of the global housing crisis. In many countries this problem has been exacerbated by single objective cost-models which favour the homogeneous development of market tenures at the expense of delivering high-quality affordable homes. Despite the obvious environmental and fuel-poverty alleviation benefits of advanced energy performance standards, such as Passivhaus, they are often dismissed as an affordable housing solution due to elevated build-cost premiums. The present work attempts to reconcile this housing affordability - energy performance nexus by establishing a novel decision support framework for Passivhaus design using genetic multi-objective optimization. The use of constrained genetic algorithms coupled to the Passive House Planning Package software is shown to produce cost optimal designs which are fully compliant with the Passivhaus standard. The findings also reveal that the precise choice of Passivhaus certification criteria has significant impacts on overheating risks using future probabilistic climate data. This means that the design implications of using either the peak heating load or annual heating demand certification criteria must be temporally evaluated to ensure resilient whole-life design outcomes. In a typical UK context, the findings show that affordable Passivhaus dwelling construction costs can be reduced by up to 366 pound/m(2) (or 22% of build cost). Use of this evidence-based decision support tool could thereby enable local authorities and developers to make better-informed decisions in relation to cost optimal trade-offs between achieving advanced energy performance standards and the viability of large affordable housing developments.

TI Affordable housing policy development: public official perspectives
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB Purpose This paper aims to examine the factors affecting the implementation of affordable housing policies in two Chinese municipal governments. Since 2010, the Chinese government has enforced an ambitious plan to adopt affordable housing provisions accompanying a series of urbanization programs. Furthermore, the policy implementation at the local level has led to various outcomes but has been scarcely investigated. The views of policy implementation from local officials are crucial in the context of intergovernmental relations. Therefore, it is important to examine the views of local public officials on the development status and challenges in the context of Chinese intergovernmental relations. Design/methodology/approach This paper verifies which factors exert significant impacts on the willingness of local officials to adapt affordable housing policies by using the logistic regression model and marginal effect estimation. With original data from the fieldwork surveys of city administrators, the measures incorporated local characteristics as well as the intergovernmental support from the central government in two selected megacities, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Findings There are significant differences in local investment between the selected cities. Intergovernmental support from the central government, city development strategies, implementation perceptions of local governments and land supply, all significantly impact the selection of an affordable housing program and its overall implementation. Originality/value To the best of the authors' understanding, this study would be one of the first to empirically explore the view of municipal public officials on affordable housing policy in China. This paper provides an empirical analysis from municipal public officials on the local implementation of affordable housing policies in China. As the outcome of housing policies actually depends on the implementation willingness of public officials and the overall performance of local governments, this explorative study would benefit the future development of China's affordable housing policy.

TI Embedding eco-friendly and smart technology features in affordable
   housing for community happiness in Malaysia
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB Two phases of study are involved in this research: first, the sales strategies for affordable houses embedded with eco-friendly and smart technology features; and second, the impact of such houses on community happiness in Malaysia. Compared to other studies that focus on the concept of affordable housing, this study proposed a new research perspective on how eco-friendly features and smart technologies can be embedded into the affordable house to achieve community happiness. Qualitative data was collected from four focus group discussions and six face-to-face interviews. Thematic analysis was performed to generate the outcomes. It was notable that affordable price, strategic location, effective government policies, fostering pro-environmental behaviour, promotion and easy smart-home technology installation play an important role in selling the affordable eco-friendly smart house. It was further found that affordable eco-friendly smart housing will result in community happiness. This study offers new knowledge to the affordable house research area by exploring strategies to include eco-friendly and smart technology features. The urge to have these technologies was driven by the demand for current community lifestyle and happiness. This research contributes to the sustainable development goals programme by considering housing affordability, the environment, energy saving and technologies in a single study. It is also beneficial to socio-economic development as it proposes balanced sales strategies that involve social and economic aspects. The inductive approach aims to provide a theoretical framework for future researchers.

In this regard, the Malaysian Government launched the National Community Policy, among others, to promote access to a healthy lifestyle. Despite the existence of such a policy, there exists issues and challenges in providing adequate housing in Malaysia, which affects access to a healthy lifestyle in the community. Literature and content research on different platforms from previous reports, articles and mass media provide an overview of the need for sports community policy as a sustainable development objective for affordable housing programmes. The research will be restricted to the international and local policies applicable in recognising the right to a healthy community. This paper concludes that sports facilities should be assimilated into affordable housing programmes in fostering sustainability.

TI Barriers to affordable housing on brownfield sites
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Brownfield development incorporates both private and public costs due to the contamination of land. Furthermore, brownfield sites generate negative externalities on real estate viability, and are perceived to be risky and costly for development. Viability risk makes affordable housing development on brownfield sites even more financially and economically challenging. To understand this issue, this paper introduces a conceptual model to analyse and overcome the economic and financial barriers to meet both community and environmental concerns, as well as verifying how it holds in practice via case studies that cover the development of three large scale brownfield sites that integrate affordable housing in the City of San Francisco. Significant barriers to overcome include (1) engaging with economic geography rationale; (2) integrating with economic viability and sustainability concerns; (3) increasing affordable housing quality; and (4) transcending scale to improve policy tool efficacy. Conclusions argue that viability needs to consider cost-quality both internally and externally for high-quality affordable housing units in large-scale brownfield environments.

AB Sustainable housing is a worldwide challenge, while the case of Serbia could be an example of how complex the circumstances can be and how difficult it is to see the path towards sustainability. This paper sets out to answer multiple challenges; can energy-efficient, low-impact housing enter the market and respond to the needs of its population, potentially contributing to a more affordable and future-proof housing reality in Serbia? And does this demand rather different measure than the ones conventionally explored in innovative housing approaches elsewhere? To answer these questions, the paper starts from the preview of circumstances, then the methodology is proposed and explained, after which the possible building materials and technical installations for pilot multi-apartment Passive House are selected, and in the end, results are given and conclusions are drawn. Since the building is intended for a housing co-operative, both the affordability of the proposed solution and the environmental footprint has been comprehended by the methodology proposed. In the end, by carefully balancing the benefits of individual measures - favouring those that are cost-effective and discouraging the implementation of measures that are not, a viable pilot project that could step into the market-oriented society is selected.

AB Despite the commitment of the United Nations (UN) to provide everyone with equal access to basic services, the construction sector still fails to reach the production capacity and quality standards which are needed to meet the fast-growing demand for affordable homes. Whilst innovation measures are urgently needed to address the existing inefficiencies, the identification and development of the most appropriate solutions require a comprehensive understanding of the barriers obstructing the design and construction phase of affordable housing. To identify such barriers, an exploratory data mining analysis was conducted in which agglomerative hierarchical clustering made it possible to gather latent knowledge from 3566 text-based research outputs sourced from the Web of Science and Scopus. The analysis captured 83 supply-side barriers which impact the efficiency of the value chain for affordable housing provision. Of these barriers, 18 affected the design and construction phase, and after grouping them by thematic area, seven key matters of concern were identified: (1) design (not) for all, (2) homogeneity of provision, (3) unhealthy living environment, (4) inadequate construction project management, (5) environmental unsustainability, (6) placemaking, and (7) inadequate technical knowledge and skillsets. The insights which resulted from the analysis were seen to support evidence-informed decision making across the affordable housing sector. The findings suggest that fixing the inefficiencies of the affordable housing provision system will require UN Member States to accelerate the transition towards a fully sustainable design and construction process. This transition should prioritize a more inclusive and socially sensitive approach to the design and construction of affordable homes, capitalizing on the benefits of greater user involvement. In addition, transformative actions which seek to deliver more resource-efficient and environmentally friendly homes should be promoted, as well as new investments in the training and upskilling of construction professionals.

TI The cooperative urban land development model in Germany-An effective
   instrument to support affordable housing
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Several international studies have already mentioned various policy instruments to promote the sociallymixed housing policy that supports many cities to achieve inclusionary housing goals. One of the greatest challenges facing cities in Germany is the current housing shortage, especially of affordable housing and the provision of adequate social infrastructure. The main causes are the strong influx into the cities and the rapidly rising land prices. To solve these problems several German cities have developed and established cooperative urban land development (CULD) models. This study aims to review inclusionary housing policy and present a firm introduction on a land development policy instrument CULD that supports among other targets the creation of affordable housing in Germany. It includes a description of this model that has social, economic and planning goals.
   Our research approach relies on a content analysis incorporating related literature, city documents and practical projects. Under the CULD system, the increase in land value through public planning and development measures is used to cover the entire development and infrastructure costs. Furthermore, landowners or investors benefitting from urban planning are legally committed to provide a certain quota (e.g. 30%) of their developed property for social housing as well as to ensure socially mixed city districts. There has been some debate on whether this arrangement can produce a sufficient stock of affordable housing. In this article, we argue that local CULD models are powerful land management instruments to achieve socially equitable land-use, and increase the potential to transfer land in such a manner that it can enhance the prosperity of the urban regions. They can utilize the land value increase through urban planning and public infrastructure, for refinancing expenditures of urban developments, and can provide a sufficient stock of affordable housing to local residents to create social mix in cities. In this way, CULDs can make a significant contribution to the economic and social objectives of sustainable urban development.

TI Comfort within Budget: Assessing the Cost-Effectiveness of Envelope
   Improvements in Single-Family Affordable Housing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In Brazil, the delivery of homes for low-inc ome households is dictated by costs rather than performance. Issues such as the impact of climate change, affordability of operational energy use, and lack of energy security are not taken into account, even though they can severely impact the occupants. In this work, the authors evaluated the thermal performance of two affordable houses as-built and after the integration of envelope improvements. A new replicable method to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these improvements was proposed. The case study houses comprise the most common affordable housing type delivered widely across Brazil and a proposition of a better affordable housing solution, built in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, integrating passive design strategies to increase thermal comfort. The findings reveal a potential for improving indoor thermal conditions by up to 76% and 73%, respectively, if costs are not a concern, and 40% and 45% with a cost increase of 12% and 9% if a comfort criterion of 20-25 degrees C was considered. Equations to estimate costs of improvements in affordable housing were developed. The authors concluded that there is a great scope for building envelope optimisation, and that this is still possible without significant impact on budget.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF QUALITY INDICATORS OF HOUSING DESIGN (QIHD), AN APPROACH
   TO IMPROVE DESIGN QUALITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB This research has been conducted to determine the design quality indicators and parameters for affordable housing in Karachi Pakistan. The absence of quality in Karachi housing resulted from various factors ranging from policy failure, violation of bylaws, population, housing scarcity and non availability of quality parameters etc. The amalgamation of these factors eventually lowers the quality of housing and ultimately results deficient housing design and construction. Because of this trend the end users experience the nuisance of unplanned maintenance and bear the tax of heavy repair and reworks. Significance of research has been accomplished through developing design quality models for both professional and users. This research has eventually evaluated forty eight (48) quality indicators for housing design (QIHD) from listed 65 design quality variables farmed in seven sections. This research concludes that existing design quality of affordable housing in Karachi could be enhanced through improving the design, construction, services, site development and neighborhood and sustainability. The QIHD model will provide the opportunity for design and construction professionals of city to rethink their housing design intellect in context of the housing quality.

AB This article presents the alternatives resulting from the analysis of environmental feasibility and its associated costs, based on the incorporation of the sustainable criteria determined by the LEED certification, for the development of a case study in affordable housing, in the city of Bogota D.C. The methodology is based on the standards set by LEED BD+C Homes for the Design and Construction of Multifamily Midrise Buildings. A propositional study is developed through financial scenarios, in order to evaluate if these technologies in affordable housing are feasible from the investment perspective of builders in Colombia, considering that to this date the implementation of criteria that will lead to the LEED certification has not been applied to this type of projects. The findings allow us to distinguish barriers and opportunities from the prominent implications of the inclusion of these sustainable technologies in low-income housing.

TI Design optimization of sustainable affordable housing model in hot-arid
   climate-case of Jordan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to study and evaluate the situation of different affordable housing projects with an eye toward developing a new affordable and sustainable housing model in the hot-arid climate of Jordan. There is a clear interest in providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. To bridge this gap, and to meet Jordanian housing needs while tackling environmental problems, this research has analyzed the environmental issues of selected housing projects in Jordan, aiming to determine the existing problems. In addition, it proposes a solution through a sustainable and affordable housing model that was analyzed and compared to the previously studied housing projects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional design strategy was adopted and a mixed design method was used. Information related to the physical and operation characteristics of buildings was collected through the review of "as built" drawings and other relevant documents. Further information was obtained from field surveys and personal interviews with architects and decision-makers in the housing sector. Energy consumption patterns of these housing projects were analyzed using the DesignBuilder simulation program. Water efficiency was assessed using the BRE Code Water Calculator. Based on the previous analysis, a new housing model was developed that was evaluated in terms of energy and water consumption.
   Findings - The analysis shows a significant difference among different housing projects in terms of energy cooling and heating loads in different climatic regions in Jordan. Energy analysis proved that the proposed model is energy efficient in different locations and it can save up to 50.4 per cent of annual energy usage in comparison with existing projects. In addition, it can save around 43 per cent of water consumption by using a number of modifications for saving water.
   Originality/value - Most of the housing initiatives focus on providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. This research will bridge the gap by reducing the operation cost of affordable housing through adapting and implementing sustainable measures of design and construction.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the challenges of promoting home ownership for first-time Malaysian homebuyers. This paper also offers suggestions regarding sustainable housing provision for them to own their home. In order to achieve sustainability in the housing delivery system, affordable housing schemes must be economically viable, socially acceptable and technically feasible. Government should be transparent about logistics, location, pricing and implementation to ensure that there is action behind the words.

TI A value chain approach to financial centres - The case of Frankfurt
SO TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
AB This paper uses a value chain approach to identify possible patterns of spatial (re)organisation resulting from the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) in wholesale financial services. Although ICT can be used to split up production processes and thus increase mobility, proximity - not only spatial but also cultural, organisational and professional - remains essential for the financial industry. Thus, while ICT may induce a 're-bundling' of functions among financial centres, location continues to be a relevant factor. An analysis of the value chains; of three financial products is presented with a focus on implications for the financial centre in Frankfurt. Frankfurt is a particularly interesting case study of this phenomenon as it is one of the centres for the development of 'financial technology, such as computer-based trading systems with remote access.

TI Strategic use of land policy instruments for affordable housing - Coping
   with social challenges under scarce land conditions in Swiss cities
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB For decades, many cities have introduced densification policy objectives to stop urban sprawl or to promote efficient use of natural resources. In the urban housing sector, however, densification projects often intensify social challenges. Due to rising rents after modernization of existing housing stocks as a consequence of densification, low-income tenants are forced to leave their apartments. Risks of social exclusion and segregation increase simultaneously.
   In this article, we analyze how municipal planning authorities cope with affordable housing shortages in a context of urban densification. Specifically, we ask: How do municipal planning authorities promote affordable housing in densifying cities? To answer this research question, we apply a neoinstitutional analysis approach to better understand (1) the basic mechanisms of how land policy instruments impact affordability, and (2) why specific instruments are activated to defend affordable housing objectives. Through qualitative case study analysis of four Swiss urban municipalities, our results show that the mere availability of land policy instruments is not sufficient but that the strategic activation of specific instruments matters.

TI Affordable housing and clean technology transfer in construction firms
   in Brazil
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB The affordable housing deficit in Brazil is 5.6 million homes. The Main Brazilian housing government program was called "Minha Casa, Minha Vida" from 2009 to 2020. It had little progress in the housing sustainability requirements in the last ten years. For that reason, construction industry has very little changed in terms of innovation. However, this sector has maintained standard production on a large scale. So, the crucial change could become from companies. The clean technology transfer is limited in the Brazilian affordable housing firms. One solution is to analyse this transfer process like a network. Then, it will be possible to evaluate the technological adaptability of these kinds of construction firms. This research aimed to estimate the clean technology transfer between construction firms in Brazil dedicated to building affordable housing. For this, it was identified the 69 construction firms in five cities of Rio Grande do Sul. The cities were Canoas, Caxias do Sul, Passo Fundo, Pelotas, Porto Alegre. Then, a network analysis identified the degree, betweenness, closeness, and density. These studies identify poor performance versus sustainability needs of current low-cost construction. As a result, it identifies the technology transfer capabilities that allow medium-term gains for Brazilian construction firms. Finally, we developed technology transfer indicators to understand the complexity of affordable housing production in Brazil.

CL YORK, ENGLAND
SP Housing Studies Assoc
AB This paper compares recent experience in the use of the planning system to facilitate the provision of affordable housing in rural areas of Scotland and England. Following an introduction summarising key issues arising from the relevant literature, the paper first sets out the scale of need for rural affordable housing in the two countries and then summarises the differing planning policy frameworks. Scale of delivery is then addressed and an attempt is made to establish the extent to which differences in performance reflect variations in policy, delivery mechanisms or differing housing markets. The hypothesis is advanced that Scotland, although a more rural country, has made less use of planning policy to tackle issues relating to the need for rural social housing. In both countries scale of provision has lagged behind perceived need and a major reason for this would appear to be the tensions in planning policy between environmental and social sustainability objectives, with the scales so far weighted towards the environmental rather than the social imperative.

   Africa and Asia? Examples of innovative housing finance models from
   Reall's global network
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
AB While delivering decent, affordable housing at scale is essential to global sustainable development, one formidable blockage is a lack of accessible housing finance for end users. People on low incomes have been perceived by lenders as high risk. They are excluded from financial systems and are forced to self-build using informal credit at exorbitant rates. This article engages with this problem, discussing practical examples and potential ways forward. It does so through case studies of models from Reall (a UK-based international development organization and social enterprise that promotes affordable homes) and its partner organizations in India, the Philippines, Nepal, Mozambique and Pakistan. The article evaluates the strengths and limitations of these models, and their potential for scaling up. Reall's partners demonstrate that decent houses can be delivered at a cost that is accessible for potential low-income homeowners, while proving the viability of lending to borrowers in the bottom of the income pyramid. This is essential for demonstrating the commercial viability and impactful investment opportunity represented by affordable housing in urban Africa and Asia.

AB This paper demonstrates the impact of knowledge sharing on the perception of innovation drivers for affordable housing, with a focus on the community land trust shared equity housing model (CLT SEHM). In the context of a competitive housing sector, the research identified and validated drivers for affordable housing innovation through CLT SEHM development. Moreover, data was sought through semi structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. The research employed binary logistic regression to test if there are significant effects of CLT SEHM knowledge on respondents' perceptions. The paper confirms the influence of knowledge on individual perceptions of innovation drivers. Consequently, the predisposition of policy makers or communities to support innovation in affordable housing delivery could be positively influenced by the level of knowledge available to potential project beneficiaries and housing development stakeholders as a whole.

SO ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper presents a sustainability assessment model to holistically guide sustainable construction and green retrofitting of affordable housing from the Ghanaian perspective. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive review was carried out, which yielded 16 sustainability indicators. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted among respondents in the Ghanaian housing sector. Forty-seven valid responses were received and analysed using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique. Findings A four-index model was developed that includes: Housing and Transportation (H + T) index, household-satisfaction index, efficient stakeholder-management index and quality-related index. These indices account for 25.3%, 26.3%, 23.6% and 24.9% of sustainability attainment in affordable housing, respectively. Accordingly, household-satisfaction has the greatest contribution to sustainability attainment in affordable housing. Research limitations/implications Due to challenges in obtaining responses to the questionnaire, the study was conducted with relatively small number of responses. Originality/value The model serves as a tool that could be used to objectively and comprehensively assess sustainability performance in affordable housing. Besides, it could be used as a baseline to calibrate future projects and for benchmarking success levels of comparable housing projects. Finally, the estimated indices are applicable in decision making for optimum resource allocation for sustainable low-cost housing in the Ghanaian perspective.

TI STATION POINTE GREENS-THE JOURNEY TO NET ZERO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB Station Pointe Greens, a proposed 219-unit residential and commercial development, promises to be one of the most leading edge Passive House Certified Developments in North America. However, an innovative project such as this requires much time and research, and this project being no exception, it is still in its research and design phase. Its story began in 2008 when the City of Edmonton issued a request for proposals from developers regarding improvement of a brownfield site in Belvedere. This was done as part of the City's redevelopment initiative for an area which was in dire need of revitalization. The Communitas Group saw a huge opportunity to develop a large-scale multi-family project immediately adjacent to a light rail transit and bus hub. And so the vision of an affordable and sustainable housing project began to take shape. Communitas had already tested the 'green' construction waters on previous projects, most notably Grandin Green, a 15-storey high-rise which was the first Canadian project to qualify for the Federal CBIP grant (25% more energy efficient than required by the Model National Energy Code for Buildings). However, they had never attempted anything as bold and leading edge as Station Pointe Greens. Their goal from the outset was to build one of the greenest multi-family housing cooperative complexes in North America. And like most developers, Communitas wanted to build it with as little 'green' premium as possible. This was, after all, to be affordable housing.
   In the beginning, the vision was to see how close the project could get to being a net-zero energy, zero carbon emissions project and still remain affordable. It evolved, through the assistance of grant research financing received from the EQuilibrium Communities Initiative (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Natural Resources Canada), to an affordable development seeking Passive House Certification, including an on-site waste water treatment facility. And furthermore, the need to research 'green financing' arose. How would Communitas best fund the green premium so that the units could stay affordable? So even though this project is still in the research and design phase, the evolution of the design process, the waste water treatment plant, and the green financing research has yielded some interesting information worth sharing.

SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
AB While there is increasing attention to the ways in which safe and affordable housing may promote improved health, less work has focused on the role of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program-the largest source of affordable housing in the United States. Through qualitative interviews, we examined the perspectives of diverse stakeholders in the housing sector on the opportunities and obstacles involved in including health-related criteria in LIHTC funding decisions. Our interviews revealed a growing desire within the housing sector to address health needs but, with the exception of green building criteria, a lack of clear standards on best practices. Stakeholders noted the challenges of effectively partnering with local health institutions, the need to develop sustainable payment mechanisms for health-related services, and the importance of locating developments near health-promoting resources. By describing mechanisms for integrating health services into the affordable housing infrastructure, this study helps lay the groundwork for the development of cross-sector partnerships.

   Design/methodology/approach - A research methodology, consisted of literature review and field studies, is designed to accomplish four objectives. First, to provide a comprehensive literature review of the concepts of affordable housing, project stakeholders, CSR and partnership; second, to present and synthesis the results of relevant field studies examined the experiences of CSR and partnership among selected construction firms and the Government of South Africa (SA) in affordable housing projects; third, to develop a CSR-partnership model (and its action plan) that integrates the CSR of project stakeholders to achieve greater housing affordability; finally, to draw some conclusions and recommendations to improve the practice of CSR and partnership among government authorities and construction professionals.
   Findings - Affordable housing is one of the greatest challenges that face countries around the globe, especially developing countries. The complexity of the problem hinders governments, alone, from achieving their plans for sustainable development. Project stakeholders must have social responsibilities towards supporting government initiatives for affordable housing development. The five-domain CSR-partnership model developed by the authors will help integrating the CSR of project stakeholders as an approach for developing affordable housing project.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the conceptual nature of the proposed model, it has to be tested and validated to ensure its capability to integrate the CSR of project stakeholders as an innovative approach for overcoming the difficulties facing governments in providing housing for the poor.
   Originality/value - The conducted review provides better understanding of the issue related to the practice of social responsibilities and partnership of project stakeholders, both worldwide and in SA. Through its five domains (government, society, economy, law, and technology), the proposed CSR-partnership model and its action plan are expected to serve as a foundation for optimising the partnership of project stakeholders with government authorities towards better housing affordability. This ideology has received scant attention in construction literature. The developed model represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.

TI Why Does the Government Fail to Improve the Living Conditions of Migrant
   Workers in Shanghai? Reflections on the Policies and the Implementations
   of Public Rental Housing under Neoliberalism
SO ASIA & THE PACIFIC POLICY STUDIES
AB How to get affordable housing is the primary concern of many peasant migrants working in Shanghai. Although the central government has issued a series of policies regarding migrant housing in recent years, they are merely rhetoric and incapable to meet migrant workers' needs. This article aims to interrogate why the public housing policy cannot solve migrant housing problems and what neoliberalism means in housing provision. It is argued that the neoliberal approaches embedded in public rental housing implementation show that the government prioritises public rental housing for the middle class, which is considered important to the economy, and ignores the others. The prioritisation gives rise to the failure of providing affordable housing to peasant migrant workers. Living in safe and affordable housing is vital to their well-being and the sustainable economic growth in urban China. Policy advice is addressed in the conclusion.

   Bargarh district of Odisha, India
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose The research aims to explore the wisdom, knowledge and practices in vernacular housing settlements with their sustainability underpinnings as tools for modelling rural affordable housing in tropical regions. The study is based on a weaving settlement in Bargarh district of Odisha, which is globally acclaimed for its Ikkat style of weaving. Design/methodology/approach A hierarchical framework of sustainability resting on the three pillars of ecological, economical and environmental dimensions is derived from existing theoretical research. This framework of 22 indicators is subsequently assigned to assess the sustainability of the vernacular weavers' settlement through quantitative evaluation. A qualitative assessment through observation and deduction also verifies the result. Findings Since the vernacular weavers settlement performs very well on the sustainability scorecard, the paper suggests that its best practices can be incorporated while designing affordable housing so that social, cultural and heritage values are retained and a climate conscious, energy-efficient sustainable approach is ensured. Practical implications The recommendations from the assessment has many lessons while framing policies for rural affordable housing as it cannot have one size that fits all settlement typology irrespective of the occupational, climatic and social needs. Originality/value The sustainable design and planning principles embedded in this vernacular settlement offers a valuable blueprint to re-imagine the affordable housing in rural areas which can be myopic if it does not take into account the occupational needs and life style of craftsmen dwellers.

SO BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB Does passive housing really have better environmental performance than conventional housing? Three passive houses and four conventional houses were compared using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The comparison also provided an actor analysis for the building supply chain and building inhabitants. Results are presented for two scenarios: 'conventional choices' and 'green choices' by the actors. The comparison confirms that passive houses have lower energy use than conventional houses, but when the environmental impact of energy production is taken into consideration, the outcome is less clear. Conventional houses can be equally good environmentally in terms of global warming, acidification, or radioactive waste as typical passive houses with electrical heating depending on the actors' choices. Actor analysis shows that inhabitants' and material producers' electricity choice are very important, while other choices (e.g. green transport) are less important. The findings highlight the importance of environmentally responsible decisions throughout the whole life cycle and the need for appropriate behaviours and actions, along with implications for improved communication.

TI Participatory Action Research in Affordable Housing Partnerships:
   Collaborative Rationality, or Sleeping with the Growth Machine?
SO PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
AB Participatory Action Research (PAR) emphasizes working with communities to develop questions that are relevant to their needs, then co-generating research to answer these questions. Typically, PAR focuses on empowering marginalized communities. Transforming Housing is a community-university collaborative partnership based in Melbourne Australia, with researchers asking developers, government, investors and community housing providers what they need to know in order to provide more and better affordable housing, then collectively generating ideas. After three years, this article takes a reflective practice lens to examine both possibilities and pitfalls arising from PAR with the rich and powerful. The article concludes that collaborate research on affordable housing can lead to outcomes intellectually honest, sustainable beyond political cycles and capable of effecting positive change at both the local and the metropolitan scales. However, this form of collaborative research can be easily derailed by politics, and does not address underlying structural inequalities.

TI Construction and energy aspects of affordable housing developments for
   formal settlements
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND
   PLANNING
AB Nearly one-quarter of the world's urban population lives in informal settlements or encampments, most in developing countries but increasingly also in the most affluent countries. Many residents live in overcrowded, insecure dwellings, without water and sanitation, fearful of eviction and subject to preventable life-threatening illnesses. UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' is committed to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and upgrade slums by 2030. There is therefore an urgent need for more affordable and permanent housing to be developed. This paper presents a review of the construction and energy aspects of affordable housing developments for informal settlement dwellers. The conditions of existing informal settlements in Global South countries have been researched and various case studies of informal settlement upgrading programmes are presented. The potentials of solar energy technologies in development of green affordable houses in case study countries Uganda and Indonesia are assessed.

AB The success of transit corridors in promoting sustainable regional growth hinges on location decisions made by private-sector developers. This paper centers on a series of interviews with 24 residential and commercial developers in the Twin Cities region. Developers were recruited for interviews using random sampling by residential/commercial and urban/suburban specialty. The authors analyzed interview transcripts using close readings and computerized content analysis focused on word frequency analysis and topic co-occurrence statistics. Recommendations for promoting transit-oriented development include reforming zoning and development regulations, broadening the focus of TOD to include frequent bus routes, providing greater certainty of future transit improvements. Recommendations for integrating TOD with affordable housing development include pursuing affordable-by-design solutions and engaging with affordable housing specialists. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Housing supply value chain in relation to housing the urban poor
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Housing the urban poor has continued to be a world challenge regardless of many research efforts, necessitating more research focus on details that constitute affordable housing supply. To achieve this, this study examined housing supply value chain by disintegrating it into its three main components of housing finance, land acquisition and housing construction; to thoroughly investigate each as it relates to the urban poor. A systematic review of academic literature was conducted to assess how components of housing supply value chain relate to the urban poor across the world. This study assembled 58 papers that were published from 2012 up to date in 2022, of which 16 were subject to detailed review, following screening. The review found that most scholars opine that better affordable housing provision strategies will merge both bottom-up and top-down approaches for balance. Land acquisition is relatively less discussed in literature. The review recommended that the three main activities involved in housing provision should be identified independently but tackled both independently and interdependently for a more comprehensive solution to the complicated sustainable affordable housing provision challenge across the world. The study is policy-oriented and the framework of effective affordable housing supply/provision approach devised in this study makes it useful for future research directions.

TI Stakeholder Deliberation on Developing Affordable Housing Strategies:
   Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Transit-Oriented Developments
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Transit-oriented developments (TODs) are commanding high land and rental values due to improved accessibility and economic opportunities. Owing to the increase in land and rental values, the highly desirable TODs are gradually becoming inaccessible to the poor, creating social exclusion and housing inequities within the TODs. To address this consequence, the study proposes a three-level stakeholder deliberation framework (inform, involve, and collaborate) towards developing inclusive housing strategies for equitable and sustainable TODs. The framework is applied to the context of the Yeshwanthpur industrial area, Bengaluru, India. The first level of deliberation, 'information', foregrounds the need for affordable housing strategies for stakeholders. In the second level of deliberation, the stakeholders involved identify the major challenges in incorporating affordable housing into TODs. In the third level of deliberation, stakeholders collaborate to contemplate strategies to combat each challenge. The results show that mandatory inclusionary zoning, special-purpose planning vehicles, land banking entities, innovative financing tools, and local area level plans in collaboration with the community, emerged as potentially feasible strategies to create inclusive housing outcomes in the TOD case study area.

TI Identifying Key Success Factors for Social Enterprises Serving
   Base-of-Pyramid Markets through Analysis of Value Chain Complexities
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS
AB There are people in this world who have little or no access to basic needs and they struggle financially, living on less than a handful of dollars a day. A better understanding of how to supply/serve the world's poor is needed. In this paper, through the lens of Porter's value chain framework we investigate the challenges and opportunities social enterprises face in base-of-pyramid (BoP) markets based on secondary data on 23 organizations. Our contribution is twofold: First, we analyze value chain complexities for the social enterprise based on the value creation role (consumer, coproducer) and income level (poverty, extreme poverty) of the local population. We find that nature of customers' requirements varies across customer segments in the BoP markets and social enterprises face unique challenges in fulfilling such differentiated demand patterns. Second, we develop an affordability-accessibility framework that helps to identify the situations that may be favorable/unfavorable for social enterprises to meet the challenges in BoP markets. We make four propositions that social enterprises may use to cope with difficulties in affordability and accessibility. Our findings will be useful for such organizations to understand and design better supply chains for the base of pyramid.

AB One of the central goals of affordable housing is to provide a decent and suitable living environment, which includes ensuring the housing is of good quality and is economically affordable. It is also vital for housing to continue to maintain these qualities throughout the building's life cycle. Incorporating sustainable building practices can improve energy efficiency, reduce the waste of resources, and provide healthier living environments for the occupants. With the increase in intelligent technologies, opportunities exist to enhance sustainability and affordability in residential communities by utilizing smart technologies. This paper involves a critical review of the literature involving sustainable buildings and affordable housing and seeks to identify opportunities to implement smart and connected technologies while enabling those communities to achieve sustainability goals. In addition, this study highlights the current trends such as building-to-grid connections, distributed energy resources, and the potential impacts of these technologies on connected communities. The study highlights several opportunities to improve sustainability and connectedness in affordable housing. However, several factors should be addressed in implementing new technology, such as utilizing proper data management, defining beneficial information exchanges, and addressing complex human-building interactions.

TI Evaluation of Affordable Housing Program in Papua New Guinea: A Case of
   Port Moresby
SO BUILDINGS
AB Providing affordable housing has been a long-standing issue for governments of most countries. In an attempt to address the issue, affordable housing programs have been introduced with the aim of improving household's access to housing, as well as sustain their wellbeing. This paper reports on a study of the activities of affordable housing program (AHP) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), using Port Moresby as a case. It also reports a potential strategy for improving effectiveness of the program. Data was collected from interviews involving private property developers, building contractors, and an official of the National Housing Corporation. Documents related to PNG housing sector and AHP were also reviewed. The results show that the criteria used for measuring housing affordability is lacking in PNG. Low-income households do not benefit from the AHP, which focuses mainly on homeownership scheme. Role of the public sector and private sector in the provision of affordable housing is not clear. Most private developers would like to supply more houses to the housing market. However, the developers face challenges such as shortages of secure land, high cost of materials for constructing houses, and lack of trunk infrastructure. If the aim is to improve effectiveness of the AHP, there is a need to develop criteria for measuring housing affordability and to introduce affordable housing schemes that meet low-income household's preferences and demand. It is necessary to reduce housing costs by making more secure land available for development, providing trunk infrastructure, and sourcing building materials locally. The sustainability of AHP should be given due consideration during the planning and design phase. The findings could assist urban development managers and planners in designing a more effective AHP in PNG.

TI How Supply Chain Integration Affects Innovation in a Digital Age:
   Moderating Effects of Sustainable Policy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB With the rapid development of digital technologies and increasing public attention on environmental problems, it has become a new challenge for global enterprises to manage supply chains responsibly, so as to improve their innovation performance for sustainability. Prior works have identified the effects of supply chain integration on firm innovation in advanced economies; however, so far, there has been limited research on the relationships between supply chain integration and firm innovation in emerging and developing countries. Hence, building upon transaction cost and resource dependence theories, this study used China's manufacturing industry as the research setting, probing the dynamic mechanisms between supply chain integration and firm innovation. The results show that the degree of supply chain integration positively relates to firms' patent output but negatively relates to their innovation efficiency, and that a sustainable policy moderates the foregoing associations. Our study enriches the body of knowledge regarding responsible supply chain integration in a new digital age with growing ecological concerns and thereby offers insightful practical implications for practitioners and policy makers.

TI Addressing the Affordable Housing Crisis for Vulnerable Renters:
   Insights From Broward County on an Affordable Housing Acquisition Tool
SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB South Florida is experiencing an affordable rental crisis that is especially burdensome on those most vulnerable in society, low-income households. Rapid urbanization has resulted in inequitable land-use patterns that are a barrier to housing for the poor. As a solution to the crisis, local housing agencies seek to expand their affordable housing stock for vulnerable renters in opportunity-rich neighborhoods, but there is no standard framework for identifying properties for acquisition. Broward County serves as a case study to develop a housing acquisition tool. Using a combination of spatial statistics and principal components analysis, neighborhoods in which housing agencies may consider acquiring property are identified through the creation of an affordability surface in ArcGIS. Affordability is overlain by an opportunity surface derived from neighborhood quality and accessibility rankings. The results identify neighborhoods in Broward County that are both affordable and opportunity-rich, to better serve the county's most vulnerable renters.

SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB This paper aims to determine the challenges and prospects for affordable housing within the context of sustainability by investigating the socio-economic and environmental impacts of housing developments based on the analysis of four so-called affordable housing schemes in Yola, Nigeria. Using questionnaire survey and indicators developed from literature reviews on affordable and sustainable housing, the findings suggest that due to inadequate availability of housing inputs (land, finance, infrastructure, labor and materials), lack of diversity, improper location, inefficient transport facilities and lack of user participation, the examined developments are neither sustainable nor affordable. The research hence contributes some empirical evidence to overcome the defined shortcomings and provides a basis for governments' housing commitments towards reforming and devising policies for community involvement in housing provision, providing easy access to land with legal title deeds, easy access to housing finance, infrastructure, etc.

TI Tactical Moments of Creative Destruction for Affordable Housing
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB The formation of a marketing system often reflects historical legacies that seek to protect and preserve longstanding community interests. These legacies encourage some patterns of adaptive growth, but they may also limit other avenues of productive change. In this essay, we focus on the United States housing system as an illustration of a marketing system with significant legacy structures. Historically, this marketplace system arose to provide safe shelter for citizens and was enacted through building codes. These codes arose for historically important reasons, many of which are still pertinent today. Other legacies, however, inhibit market innovations, such as the significant barriers that exist for developing affordable housing. We argue that change in legacy market systems may require tactical moments of creative destruction. We examine a multi-stakeholder approach across the macro, meso, and micro levels of the marketplace to enable novel solutions for systemic change.

AB Purpose The establishment of design criteria is an important activity in the initial phase of housing development. A lack of adequate information regarding design criteria will result in poor satisfaction of homebuyers, pre-occupancy obsolescence, high maintenance costs, property overhang and the abandonment of houses. In Malaysia, many of these consequences are prevalent. However, while information on homeowners' requirements is inconclusive, paper aims to investigate the criteria upon which design teams/developers base their decisions in the design of affordable housing.
   Design/methodology/approach The present research conducted a cross-sectional survey questionnaire comprising 25 design criteria administered to 200 stakeholders in the housing industry. The design criteria were determined through a weighted mean. The associations between the criteria were analysed through a principal component analysis.
   Findings The results found that safety and security of home occupants and property, maintenance costs, noise and nuisance minimisation, extent of future modifications and waste disposal were the five major design criteria. Factor analysis narrowed down the 25 criteria to six factors, which explained 77 per cent of the total variance. The six underlying factors named of significance were operating costs, sustainability, comfort, neighbourhood, transportation and spatial. The findings also indicated that the design teams/developers paid little attention to a few critical design criteria.
   Research limitations/implications Future studies should involve a large sample size and increase the design criteria.
   Practical implications The study is important for improving homebuyers' satisfactions because it provides information design team and developers decision-making factors.
   Originality/value This study is the first to address design criteria of affordable housing in Malaysia and elsewhere. This research provides fresh information on design management of affordable housing. The findings will be useful to policymakers, urban planners, place managers, design consultants and developers.

TI Affordable Modular Housing for College Students Emphasizing Habitability
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB This research investigated key concepts of temporary residence and analyzed characteristics of modular architecture. Based on the results of the critical review, this research proposed an analytic framework emphasizing habitability to identify the potential of modular architecture as affordable housing for college students. The framework is composed of three dimensions: habitability, sustainability and affordability. Compared to the existing studies on modular architecture, habitability is more heavily emphasized and a new term, 'affordability', is included in the proposed framework. Through the case studies, the residential environment of four dormitories was analyzed using the proposed framework with a focus on comfortable and healthy living. The results suggest that ensuring habitability is essential for residents' comfortable and healthy living; however, it would increase construction and maintenance costs. Social interrelationship among residents could be encouraged through various community facilities and activities, strengthening the residents' ties to the community. The proposed framework would contribute to the development of affordable housing for students, guided by the essential dimensions to be considered for the application of modular housing.

SO URBAN RESEARCH & PRACTICE
AB Global economic restructuring since the 1970s, and the rollback of the welfare state in the Global North has been a major contributor to a reduction in the affordable housing stock Similarly in the so-called Global South recent economic development has been accompanied by a lack of sustainable affordable housing and housing policies. In this short paper, I aim to analyse important policy papers from the central government of Turkey and local government of Istanbul focusing on the housing policies. I will use content and policy analysis to examine the legal and policy framework in the city of Istanbul and compare this with what is happening on the ground. These policy papers include Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Strategical Plan (2020-2024), Turkey 11th 5 year Development Plan Housing Politics (2019-2023), Urban Development Strategy (2010-2023) and Istanbul Regional Plan (2014-2023).

TI FLEXIBLE PLANNING AND FLEXIBLE BUILDINGS - REUSING REDUNDANT OFFICE
   SPACE
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS
AB London entered the 1990s with the combination of an unprecedented oversupply of office space and severe shortages of affordable housing. As part of its approach to increase the supply of affordable housing, central government suggested that local authorities encourage converting empty office buildings into housing. This also was seen as a way to reduce commuting and thereby to meet targets of environmental ''sustainability''. However, the research reported here shows that conversion is unlikely to become a major source of housing supply unless planning policies become more flexible, office buildings are of the appropriate type, and building owners are prepared to accept the scale of their financial losses. In the long run, a more flexible approach to building design and construction is necessary to ensure that buildings can be converted easily when demands arise for new uses.

TI Affordable Housing and Social Mix: Comparative Approach
SO JOURNAL OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN ENGINEERING AND
   CONSTRUCTION
AB This article deals with European and American legal techniques used to provide affordable housing and promote social mix in communities. Using a comparative approach, the work studies the concepts of sustainability and social and territorial cohesion (widely used in the legal European environment and present in the American legal framework too). The article analyzes the role of affordable housing as an element to promote social inclusion. Taking as a reference the case study of Spain and considering France, England and the American inclusionary zoning, the article concludes that public intervention should promote social mix, which could be a useful antidote for urban segregation, according to current available data. In any case, further research about those issues is necessary to have more information about the exact meaning of social mix, its adequate territorial scope and its appropriate level in each urban area.

AB Affordable housing provision constitutes a very large scheme in any countries due to income distribution and national development. The supply of housing depends on many activities and processes. The purpose of the houses is to meet the requirement of the householders therefore design criteria must address the users' requirements. The establishment of the design criteria constitutes an important activity at the initial phase of the housing development. The design criteria are prepared by the design team in collaboration with many stakeholders especially the householders. Housinsg design criteria are the requirements that must be considered prior to construction of the housing. Lack of adequate information on the design criteria would lead to poor householders' satisfactions, increase in maintenance cost, abandonments and completed but not occupy housing. In Malaysia, many of these consequences are prevalent. However, while information on the house owners' requirements is inconclusive, this current research set out to investigate the design criteria of affordable housing. The increase in the affordable housing gap in Malaysia can be reduced if the designers have a comprehensive understanding of users' requirements and the design criteria. Through a cross sectional survey questionnaire, comprising 25 criteria, 7 criteria were found to be extremely critical. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy indicated that the strength of the relationships among variables was strong (KMO =0.716). Bartlett's test of sphericity, which tests the overall significance of all the correlations within the correlation matrix, was significant chi(2) (325) = 1825.075, p<0.001), indicating the data were drawn from the same population and that the criteria were related. Sustainability considerations are now being considered by the providers of affordable housing. Deductively, the results lead to the conclusion that a major factor responsible for the poor homebuyers / homeo ccupiers dissatisfactions is the lack of considerations of the criteria that impact significantly on the buyers/occupiers choice. The findings are significant for developers, urban planners, banks, policy makers and the academia.

TI THE ESSENCE OF LOW-ENERGY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DESIGN STRATEGIES Learnt
   from Scottish and Canadian Homebuilders' Attempt and Experience
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB Nearly one-third of the Scottish population is struggling to heat their home properly today. There is an urgent need for the delivery of low-energy affordable homes. However, the homebuilding industry has no systematic way to deliver such unconventional homes, although the UK government has set out a bold "green" target that all newly-built homes be carbon neutral by 2016. Accordingly, this paper explores the status quo of today's affordable homes being built in Scotland; and secondly, it extends the scope to the review of successfully commercialized low-to zero-energy affordable housing developments in Canada. This study emphasizes the significant impact of design choices on the delivery of low-to zero-energy affordable housing, including housing orientations and configurations; construction materials and systems, including renewable energy technologies; and internal planning, with due consideration to the time-related sun positions and the internal space day-lighting and heat gain potentials. In addition, the paper argues that the absence of clear definitions as to housing quality and affordability, and the lack of industry capacity for technical knowledge learning activities, are potential obstacles that limit the spread of sustainable zero-carbon homes in Scotland today. Moreover, the effect of the design charrette approach being practiced in Canada on the homebuilding decision making process was reviewed, with the aim of providing a base for further discussion on the applicability of Canadian low-energy affordable housing design techniques to sustainable zero carbon homes of the future in Scotland.

AB An aspect of the problems of sustainable housing technology in Nigeria like many other developing countries of the world is the escalating cost of conventional materials input to construction. These materials are not wholly produced locally, often in short supply, involves importation and hence not affordable to the poor masses. One of the paths to sustainable housing technology appears to be production of affordable housing using traditional construction materials which are adjudged to be cheaper and in abundant supply locally. Comparative construction cost analysis between the use of conventional and traditional materials was therefore performed on existing low-income building in an estate in the town of Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The result showed that the cost of two and three bedroom units reduced by 12.5% and 15.44% respectively when cement stabilized earth block was used for the wall construction, deep hardwood section for lintels, palm kernel shells (Kemelrazzo) for floor finish and wood casement window as replacement for glass louvres. It was recommended that the application of these locally sourced materials be standardized and backed up by large scale production so that prospective home owners, housing cooperatives and private developers can buy at affordable prices.

TI Embodied Energy Consumption in the Residential Sector: A Case Study of
   Affordable Housing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Embodied energy has a significant effect on the total environmental impact of a project. However, emphasis is often placed primarily on operational energy, resulting in a knowledge gap about the current state of embodied energy use in affordable housing. To address this, the study investigates the level of embodied energy consumption in affordable housing, as well as the drivers, barriers, and techniques to reduce embodied energy. Based on a single embedded case study covering the period from cradle to end of construction, data were collected using embodied energy calculations of three affordable housing units in the project, semi-structured interviews with five design team members, and a cross-examination of findings with contract documents. The results were analysed using sensitivity analysis and thematic analysis. The findings revealed that all three house units fulfilled the baseline embodied carbon target of 800 kg CO2/m(2) and both detached properties fell within the LETI (2020) target of 500 kg CO2/m(2). However, all three properties would fail to meet the RIBA or 2030 LETI target of 300 kg CO2/m(2). This suggests that improvements are necessary to achieve future targets. The results show that financial capabilities and operational energy prioritisation act as the main enabler and barrier for reducing embodied energy. Local contractors/suppliers, minimising material use or intensity, and modular construction were highlighted as the key reduction techniques that can be used to help achieve future targets concerning embodied carbon in residential developments. The study contributes significantly to understanding the current state of embodied energy use in affordable housing and provides new insights on how to deal with embodied energy if we are to meet future energy targets.

TI Financing Options for Green and Affordable Housing (GAH): An Exploratory
   Study of South Asian Economies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Housing is a basic human need and its affordability has become a concern with the exponential population growth, especially in densely populated developing countries. Rapid urbanization, inadequate housing and increasing slums have also brought environmental challenges to urban areas of developing countries. To address such concerns, Green Affordable Housing (GAH) has emerged as a concept with the convergence of ideas and actions of affordable housing and sustainability. This research aims to identify the GAH adoption strategies and the financial options through case study analysis of three South Asian Economies (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and validated the case study outcome by using content analysis approach. The findings reveal that India has made notable progress in establishing a GAH financial market, while Pakistan and Bangladesh are struggling due to a lack of appropriate funds and underrated financial markets. This study further proposed the financing framework to achieve GAH for South Asian economies because the low-income Credit Link Subsidy Scheme alone supporting the adoption of GAH would not be enough. The study provides policy recommendations for using Credit Link subsidies, energy-efficient mortgages, and Public-Private Partnerships for housing investment as effective methods for financingGAH.

TI Sustainability reporting for sustainable supply chain management in Peru
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Previous studies have shown that the most significant impacts of companies' operations are found in their supply chains, which are generally made up of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the other hand, sustainability reporting is a vital tool for identifying companies' potential social and environmental impacts. It is also a critical factor that can help reduce risk and increase small businesses' competitiveness, facilitating their access to global value chains. However, the vast majority of research to date has focused on sustainability reporting by large multinational companies. In this context, this article's objectives are to broaden the debate on sustainable supply chain management and gain insight into the relationship between sustainability and competitiveness in companies. A qualitative approach is used through a case study method to investigate the Corporate Sustainability and Reporting for Competitive Business program in Peru. A sample of 72 SMEs from more than 20 sectors was analysed. The results show that the social dimension was the most reported with 52%, followed by environmental with 27% and economical with 21%. The sectors reporting the most are energy, textile, and logistics. The study also indicates that 78% of SMEs fully or partially met sustainability reporting requirements stipulated by lead companies. The program also enabled the companies to improve their strategic vision, strengthen the relationship with their respective leading companies, generate greater competitiveness, and access new markets. The main conclusions indicate academic and practical implications that will reduce the impact of operations and production on the supply chain and contribute to sustainable development. Finally, the study recommends future lines of research and the application of other methodologies. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB This article presents a case study of the inter-organizational network that formed to produce four housing projects in Cleveland's EcoVillage designed to integrate social equity and ecological stewardship as the basis for neighborhood redevelopment. Our paper builds on concepts of community development and housing production through inter-organizational networks spanning nonprofit, public, and private organizations that developed and supported four ogreeno and affordable housing projects. We are interested in understanding how development of the housing projects changed and connected traditional neighborhood development and ecologically-oriented organizations and how their interaction changed the practice of housing production and environmental and sustainability advocacy locally and regionally. The results of the study reveal that the marriage of green and affordable housing in Cleveland, despite some challenges, was viewed as important and beneficial by the organizations involved, and resulted in a range of demonstration projects that not only changed the EcoVillage, but affected other neighborhood housing projects in Cleveland as well. The projects resulted in enhanced capacity for green housing production through creation of a new network of organizations spanning the housing and environmental sustainability fields of practice that continues to support sustainable housing and neighborhood development in Cleveland.

Studies regarding affordable housing leakages and their aftermath to Goal 11 in one study are scarce in Malaysia. The study investigated Malaysia's low-cost housing (LCH) leakages and their aftermath to Goal 11 and proffered measures to achieving Goal 11 and its targets. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues.Design/methodology/approachThe researchers covered four of Malaysia's major cities via a qualitative approach. The study used 40 participants via semi-structured virtual interviews, and saturation was achieved. The study adopted a thematic approach for the collected data and honed them with secondary sources.FindingsFindings group Malaysia's LCH leakages into government/agencies/departments in housing, housing developers/building contractors and client/building owners' root causes in Malaysia's context. It shows a threat from Malaysia's LCH leakages to achieving Goal 11 and proffered measures to enhance achieving Goal 11. Achieving Goal 11 will strengthen and improve Malaysia's many SDGs accomplishments because of their link.Originality/valueApart from proffering measures to mitigate long-standing issues (leakages) in Malaysia's LCH delivery from achieving Goal 11, findings will stipulate the accomplishment of other SDGs related to housing delivery.

SAH can be a solution toward sustainability development because it considered from an environmental friendly, socially enhancing, and economically benefits perfectives towards housing development. This paper aims to explore the awareness of homebuyers in Malaysia towards sustainable affordable housing. This research used the method of unstructured interview among homebuyers toward SAH in Malaysia. Based on the finding of the study, the awareness of homebuyers in SAH are relatively inadequate. Respondents are required the brief explanation on concept and elements of SAH for continue the interview. Based on Porter Five Forces Model, homebuyers' requirements hold the bargaining power of customers to determine the features of housing provided by property provider. The knowledge of homebuyers on SAH is crucial for the sustainable development, because homebuyers are one of the key drivers for implementing the sustainable requirements in housing development.

SO ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT
AB The house construction sector in Europe is facing the need to meet stricter energy requirements. For example, some customers are demanding passive houses with almost no demand for space heating. Passive house quality assurance systems have been introduced to certify the energy performance of such houses. The aim of this study was to identify opportunities for improving passive house certification in line with customer's comfort expectations. Questionnaires, site visits and interviews were carried out to identify and assess the comfort concerns of owner-occupiers in certified single-family passive houses in Flanders, northern Belgium. The results show that certified passive houses in Flanders are well rated and perceived as very comfortable. However, there were some cases where comfort concerns were expressed related to perceived flaws in the design or construction of the building services. In particular, the study recommends incorporating criteria for the planning and installation of user-friendly ventilation systems into passive house certification and providing end-users with better information.

These interventions are aimed to combine sustainability criteria with architectural, urban and environmental quality. In this context, our goal in this article is to provide an innovative perspective on the topic highlighting the positive returns enabled by the logic of the social impact approach (SIA). A pilot project is proposed to be performed in the VI arrondissement of Paris. Starting from the French regulatory context and the requirements set by the "Paris Affordable Housing Challenge" competition, the levers of social finance for new social demands and the levers of incentives are applied to a real case. The research results show that the application of the emerging principles of social impact investing (SII) in areas difficult to access in the private market had positive returns. The final aim of the article is to outline guidelines that consider the quality, management and generation of the social impact requirements highlighted in the proposal to facilitate the application of the SIA to other interventions and contexts.

TI The politics of land supply and affordable housing: Auckland's Housing
   Accord and Special Housing Areas
SO URBAN STUDIES
AB Increasingly, planning for housing development involves political conflict between local government planning practices, based on urban sustainability and housing intensification, and central government housing policies, centred on land supply and housing affordability. This paper examines a key historical moment in the politics of housing supply and planning in New Zealand. Drawing upon a discourse analysis of a range of housing policy documents and urban plans, this paper traces the dynamic of local and central government negotiations and conflict arising from the development of Auckland's spatial plan, the development of the Auckland Housing Accord (a central and local government agreement to fast-track planning permission for new housing) and the implementation of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act. The paper focuses on the manner in which certain policy knowledge is prioritised and applied in the construction of affordable housing policies and how this process, which is presented as objective evidence-based policy formation, is inherently political. It is argued that the legislation supporting housing accords alters central/local government power relations and represents a challenge to the existing planning system.

TI Vulnerability of Affordable Housing to Global Warming in South Africa:
   Case Study of a Masonry House in Johannesburg
SO BUILDINGS
AB Global warming is expected to lead to longer and more intense heatwaves, which will have negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts around the world. South Africa is projected to experience significant warming, with surface temperatures possibly increasing by up to 3 & DEG;C by mid-century. This warming trend has implications for architecture, as the demand for cooling in buildings could rise dramatically. However, socioeconomic conditions in developing countries may limit the use of air conditioning to mitigate indoor overheating. In South Africa, research has shown that government provided low-cost housing structures are thermally inefficient, with temperatures occasionally exceeding outdoor levels. Residents often rely on natural ventilation and personal actions to cope with heat. However, the effects of climate change may render these strategies insufficient if energy poverty and housing improvement are not addressed. This study aims to examine the impact of global warming on a high mass, naturally ventilated, affordable housing structure in Johannesburg, South Africa. Measured operative temperature data from a long-term experimental study, alongside adaptive temperature limits to evaluate overheating, highlight the vulnerability of indoor spaces without adequate insulation and/or thermal mass. The results underscore concerns about the performance of low-cost and affordable housing in warmer future climates in the South African interior.

SO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
SE Contemporary Issues in Entrepreneurship Research
AB Greater access to financial services is a key enabler of many of the United Nations sustainable development goals (UN SDGs). This chapter examines the role of digital financial services (DFS) in the actualisation of the UN SDGs in Nigeria by presenting a series of illustrative cases of DFS-based public and private sector enterprises driving critical SDGs in Nigeria. These enterprises are not only driving economic growth, they are also enabling value chains addressing the broad-ranging needs of the poor. Tracing possibilities around impact is important here, a context in which over 60 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. Statistics on poverty reflect not only lack of income but also the lack of access to essential services. Approximately 44 per cent of Nigeria's adult population is financially excluded and could benefit from DFS in enabling an inclusive economy.

TI Construction Technologies for Sustainable Affordable Housing within
   Fragile Contexts: Proposal of a Decision Support Tool
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The topic of sustainable affordable housing in developing countries is gaining increasing importance within international debates. The challenge is to find a balance between the concepts of sustainability and affordability in building construction within fragile contexts, overcoming basic self-made shelter solutions towards the creation of sustainable durable housing. In particular, concerning the selection of constructive technological solutions, the goal is to shift from the current decision-making process based only on economic factors to a more holistic approach based on a triple bottom line perspective, integrating economic, environmental and social sustainability. With this aim, this paper proposes a decisional support tool for contexts characterized by poor information to sustain decision-makers in identifying suitable technological solutions. The tool is based on a set of key indicators, articulated into the three pillars of sustainability. The proposed tool, conceived as scalable and replicable, is finally applied to the specific context of Mogadishu (Somalia), since it is representative of the uncertain social, political and economic nature of fragile contexts.

TI Mainstreaming passive houses: more gradual reconfiguration than
   transition
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
AB Buildings are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A transition to low-carbon housing requires the introduction of very energy-efficient buildings on a global scale and effective policy measures to support such a transformation. In this article, we study one such radical solution for energy-efficient buildings - the passive house - through a national case study in Sweden. We identify three societal domains where passive houses increasingly become embedded in the building sector: Firstly, the framing of passive houses in the public debate shifted from being presented as a radical alternative for a future low-carbon housing sector to being perceived as a specific low-energy building market segment. Secondly, passive houses have become part of a broader regional institutional and political context rather than a niche. Finally, passive houses have become a driving force for stricter building regulations but in a way that rather led to the assimilation of selected passive house features into existing sectoral structures. We conclude that the dynamics of change we find is rather a 'mainstreaming' process of gradual adaptation of construction sector structures and passive houses than a radical transformation of the built environment or the diffusion of new building technology.

TI Examining green affordable housing policy outcomes in Australia: A
   systems approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The Australian affordable rental housing sector has historically faced barriers to green building (GB) adoption due to issues of split-incentives, despite financial support from the commonwealth. This paper explores how a recent shift towards bond-based funding mechanisms offer an opportunity to integrate green building practices, and influence regional social, environmental and economic outcomes. A novel system dynamics model is developed to forecast a business as usual (BAU) and green-building scenario framed around the recently introduced Australian Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator (AHBA) policy framework. The purpose of the model is to examine how a mandate on green building standards together with the use of green versus conventional bonds impact social, environmental and economic outcomes of the framework over a 20-year horizon, within the South East Queensland metropolitan area of Australia. The study determined that the green building framework would deliver 2.37% less housing overall due to higher initial capital costs. However, offers substantial long-term energy and water efficiency benefits, improved affordability for tenants due to reduced utility costs, deferred water and energy infrastructure benefits, and considerable contributions towards Australia's carbon emission reduction targets. Tenants are expected to benefit from a 45-59% reduction in energy and a 27% decrease in water bills. Moreover, a shift to affordable green building policy could contribute to 2.9% of Australia's Conference of Parties (2030) carbon emissions reduction target if applied nationally. The study concludes with a sensitivity analysis to reveal policy refinement recommendations that would yield the benefits of green affordable housing without sacrificing the small reduction in housing stock delivered by the proposed program.

TI Challenges of responding to sustainability with implications for
   affordable housing
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Sustainability is one of the most contested ideologies of our time because everyone acknowledges that it must occur but no one can agree on what needs to change in response. This is unsurprising, because objecting to the goal of sustainability is like objecting to other inherently good goals like peace or freedom. Responses to sustainability exist on a long continuum, with some interpreting sustainability to mean conservation-at-all-costs and reduced economic growth, while others suggest that the market will ensure sustainable outcomes eventually result. Further, sustainability can be easily manipulated to justify predetermined outcomes. There are, indeed, a multitude of conceptual and pragmatic challenges to operating on sustainability, particularly when the scale shifts from a global goal to local action. Using the application of sustainability to affordable housing in Australia as a case study, this article argues that rather than limiting sustainable outcomes, the existence of the sustainability debate which focuses on the many challenges is a positive indicator that sustainability may be attainable.

TI Is subsidized housing in sustainable neighborhoods? Evidence from
   Chicago
SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB This article explores the connection between subsidized housing and sustainable urban form. Given the general disconnect between new market-rate housing in sustainable, walkable neighborhoods and affordable housing opportunities, we expect affordable housing to be located in less sustainable locations in terms of proximity to amenities, walkability, street connectivity, density, and diversity of urban form. A rich set of parcel and planning data for the city of Chicago was used to correlate sustainability indicators with the locations of both project- and tenant-based affordable housing programs. Difference-in-means tests and other descriptive statistical analysis suggest that project-based locations (with the exception of Chicago Housing Authority family units) actually score above average, especially in terms of accessibility and walkability, albeit it at the cost of concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and crime. In contrast, vouchers are located in less sustainable locations when it comes to accessibility and walkability, although they are in neighborhoods with more diversity and less poverty - and, at lower voucher concentrations, with less segregation and crime - than project units.

SE Greening of Industry Networks Studies
AB Integrating triple bottom line (TBL; economic, social, and environmental) sustainability into supply chains is a major challenge. Progress has been made to address the economic and environmental dimensions in supply chain management research; however, the social dimension is still underrepresented. This chapter reflects on research that looked at the literature on hybrid business models and social entrepreneurship in order to bridge these streams of literature to literature on sustainable supply chain management. Following the literature analysis, case-based research related specifically to social businesses in catastrophe-ridden Haiti was performed. The insights provided by the entrepreneurs of these businesses showed organizations that target TBL objectives from their inception, the specific social capabilities employed to obtain the desired TBL objectives, and the specific supply chain structures that were needed to execute and achieve the TBL goals. The purpose of this chapter is to reflect on that research as it relates to the social businesses, consider the primary results of that research, and discuss how those results might guide further research in the field of sustainable supply chain management.

AB Renovation of existing building stock presents significant environmental benefits when compared to demolition or new construction, although it presents several constraints and structural specificities. In particular, public social housing or affordable housing - is characterized by a common framework of very complex resolution. Some experiences were attempted challenging the theory of an apparent contradiction between the refurbishment of low cost housing blocks and the establishment of sustainable buildings/communities.
   The aim of the research is to suggest a system of regenerative strategies, identifying the major issues that impend on the transformation of low cost public housing neighborhoods into eco neighborhoods, and highlighting the need of working simultaneously on local ecosystem and community balance to guarantee a strong sustainability. In order to assess the proposed methodology, its opportunities and constraints, a theoretical approach was applied to a case study (Bento Jesus Caraca neighborhood, in Oeiras municipality).

TI Affordable Rental Housing Development in the For-Profit Sector: A Review
   of the Literature
SO CITYSCAPE
AB Starting with below-market interest rate loan programs in the 1960s and culminating with the creation of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program through the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the federal government has provided various incentives to encourage for-profit developers to build rental housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income households. Although for-profit firms have been involved to a far greater extent than nonprofit housing organizations in the LIHTC and other affordable housing production programs at the federal, state, and local levels, these firms have garnered relatively little attention from the academic and policy communities. This article addresses part of that gap by presenting a review of the literature(1) pertaining to the affordable housing production record of private, for-profit developers and, where possible, comparing it with the records of nonprofit housing organizations. The article also explores what is known about the extent to which for-profit firms are meeting the "quadruple bottom line." The quadruple bottom line encompasses the following four components: an affordable housing development must (1) have the financial backing necessary to preserve the development's long-term affordability, (2) address the social and economic needs of the residents, (3) contribute positively to the neighborhood, and (4) be environmentally sustainable (Bratt, 2012, 2008a). Although the evidence is limited and some findings are contradictory, several differences emerge from this review. The article also offers suggestions for further research.

TI Optimization of building envelopes using indigenous materials to achieve
   thermal comfort and affordable housing in Abuja, Nigeria
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION
AB Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate the optimization of an existing residential building in a tropical climate using indigenous materials as an alternative to conventional building envelopes to achieve thermal comfort and affordable housing. Design/methodology/approach This study mainly adopted a quantitative research methodology through a comprehensive simulation study on a selected prototype building. The energy plus simulation tool in DesignBuilder was used to predict the average monthly and annual thermal comfort of a typical residential building in the study area. Also, a cost analysis of the final optimization interventions was conducted to estimate the construction cost savings. Findings The comparative analysis of simulation results for the base-case and optimized models indicates potential advantages in replacing conventional building envelope materials with indigenous materials. The base-case simulation results showed that the annual operative temperature is more than the adaptive thermal comfort set points in tropical climates, by 8.26%. This often leads to interventions using mechanical cooling systems, thus triggering overconsumption of energy and increase in CO2 emissions. The building envelope materials for floor, walls and roof were replaced with low U-values indigenous materials until considerable results in terms of thermal comfort and overall building construction cost were achieved. The final simulation results showed that using indigenous materials for the ground floor, external walls and roof could substantially reduce the annual operative temperature by 8%, thereby increasing the predicted three months of thermal comfort in the base-case to nine months annually. Likewise, there was a 32.31%, 35.78% and 41.81% reduction in the annual CO2 emissions, cooling loads and construction costs, respectively. Originality/value The knowledge of indigenous materials as an alternative to conventional materials for sustainable buildings is not new. However, most of the available research is focused on achieving affordable housing. There is a dearth of research showing the extent that these indigenous materials can be used to improve indoor thermal comfort in developing countries with tropical climates such as Nigeria.

TI Frugal Innovation a Game Changer to Sustainable Affordable Housing
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Globally the demand for housing is far more than supply, resulting to 100 million+ been homeless and with one billion people living in inadequate homes. In addition, recent world crisis such as high rural urban migration, natural disasters like the Syria-Turkey earth quake, flooding, conflicts such as the ongoing Russia-Urkraine war, COVID-19 protocols of social distance and isolation, etc. exacerbates the housing deficit. Whilst the current approach to housing especially in developing countries concentrates on convention unsustainable approach to affordable housing delivery. With the few sustainable housing development attempts been far luxurious beyond average Ghanaian affordability. This research seeks to contribute to address housing deficit problems using frugal Innovation (FI) as a game changer to sustainable affordable housing (SAH) through a bibliometrics and a systematic review study. With regards to financial, resource-constrained, significant cost reductions over existing options and sustainable solutions, one idea currently gaining traction is frugal innovation (FI). It is more affordable than the conventional approach to development and can convert constraint into opportunity in a sustainable manner, as well as have a direct link to sustainable affordable development. Search for this study was on all disciplines with publications linked to frugal innovation and sustainable affordable housing limited to only online articles, conference publications, books, and other materials published in English on Scopus, science direct, and Google Scholar. The finding revealed, FI is a combination of all similar innovations, under one umbrella to serve the underserved bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market, making it superior to other forms of innovation. This study will contribute significantly to improving the policy direction of stakeholders in an attempt to reduce the housing deficit in Ghana and other developing countries globally. In addition, it will contribute to the UN-SDGs and UN-Habitat policymakers on the sustainable cities 2030 agenda.

AB Among the most critical problems currently facing the Muslims ummah in Malaysia is the lack of decent and affordable housing for the low and middle income families. Consequently, many such families have to endure staying in cramped and often unfavorable living conditions especially those dwellers in big cities. In Islam there exist two key socio-economic tools that are supposed to help the ummah getting out of poverty namely wakaf and zakat. However, wakaf has often been labelled as rich in asset but poor in cash. Wakaf, as depicted by such a label, and coupled with poor management have led to critiques including that wakaf has not been able to realize its potential in terms of poverty alleviation of the ummah. Zakat is seen by many as rich in cash but lacks in sustainable productivity. As such zakat, under the current state of affairs, has also been criticized as not being able to effectively help the ummah to get out of the poverty trap. Thus the issue is three dimensional in nature. The challenge therefore is on how the administration of wakaf and zakat could be innovated so that they could be utilized effectively towards helping the low to middle income Muslim families having access to affordable housing. This paper attempts to address this challenge. Through critically reviewing existing literature and discussions with key experts the paper endeavors to propose a model whereby the administrators' of wakaf and zakat and real estate developer may form a tripartite joint venture to appropriately develop wakaf land, the objective being to address the issue of affordable housing of the low to middle income families. Admittedly, the wakaf-zakat-real estate developer joint venture model is preliminary in nature and therefore experts, especially those from the Shari'ah background are invited to discuss the model further and for its Shari'ah legitimacy to be validated.

TI The Effects of Incremental Housing Approach on The Level of Residential
   Satisfaction
SO ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING
AB Housing has always been regarded as one of the basic human needs and initial rights and its related costs contain a significant portion of the household's income. Providing affordable housing for low-income groups in many countries, including Iran, is the task of the government and other supportive institutions. In this regard, the Iran's government recently actions have more focused on the quantitative dimensions of housing production and qualitative issues, which are the main factors of residential satisfaction have less been considered. This paper investigates the effects of the incremental housing approach on the level of residential satisfaction in affordable housing projects. The research method is descriptive-analytic and data were collected through the case study. The results show that influenced indicators by the incremental housing approach including land and building ownership, providing technical and spatial basis for future development, quality improvement, and strengthen the social interactions among the residents, beside site design related indicators, including anticipation of the neighborhood units with proper pattern of activities are the most important factors of residential satisfaction. High residential satisfaction lead to bring a sense of belonging to the place and in upper level the social sustainability in the residential environment. Therefore, in order to increase the efficiency of the positive aspects of this approach, a model for determining the stages of work and necessary actions has been designed.

TI Reforming Housing Policies for the Sustainability of Historic Cities in
   the Post-COVID Time: Insights from the Atlas World Heritage
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, finding affordable housing has been a notable challenge for the residents of historic cities in Europe. This paper aims to develop a novel vision for improving housing policies in the post-COVID time to moderate the long-lasting issue of affordable housing in historic cities. The research was developed based on the findings of the Atlas World Heritage in 2019. In this project, five European Art Cities, namely Florence, Edinburgh, Bordeaux, Porto, and Santiago de Compostela, discussed their common management challenges through the shared learning method. Focusing on the case study of Florence and using a mixed-method, we collected data through the municipality of Florence, map analysis, and distribution of a questionnaire among the city residents. Then, we used inductive reasoning to explain how reforming housing policies in the post-COVID time could moderate the long-lasting issue of affordable housing in historic cities. The findings suggest that housing policies need to be supported simultaneously at both international and local levels. From the international perspective, associated cultural heritage organizations, like United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its advisory bodies and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), need to develop restriction policies that manage tourism flows in historic cities like increasing the airline taxation. At the local level, Florence needs decisive housing policies that ban the growth of illegal tourist accommodation in the city. However, the privilege of establishing new hotels can be awarded in suburban or rural areas to support sustainable tourism goals.

TI Application of blockchain technology for sustainability development in
   agricultural supply chain: justification framework
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology, is conceptualised as a type of disruptive technology and is regarded as one of the prime tools of Industry 4.0 today. The varied features of Blockchain like smart contract, decentralisation, transparency, traceability, data immutability and data privacy along with a consensus mechanism make it suitable to be utilized in the complex and multi-echelon supply chains of today. These factors improve the production processes and make the existing supply chains agile, resilient and responsive in the long term. Blockchain also add an aspect of sustainability which correlates with the phenomenon of circular economy in today's world. Hence firms should compare and evaluate the significance of the traditional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain in bringing the concept of sustainability in the supply chain today. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of blockchain in supply chain management with the help of a literature review along with opinions of experts from the agricultural sector. The key benefits identified are data privacy, decentralisation, immutability of data, smart contract, improved sustainability, building of resilient supply chains, transparency and shared database. These potential benefits of blockchain are assessed using the analytical hierarchical process technique. Global desirability index for traditional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain is calculated. The high value of global desirability index of the blockchain-enabled supply chain over the traditional supply chain suggests that the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain is justified for bringing sustainability in the supply chain. This study aims to offer meaningful implications for practitioners so that they can take suitable measures for adoption of this technology.

TI Meeting first-time buyers' housing needs and preferences in greater
   Kuala Lumpur
SO CITIES
AB High housing prices in Greater Kuala Lumpur have made it difficult for potential first-time homebuyers to own a house. As a result, affordable housing schemes were introduced recently to assist potential homeowners. The Malaysian government has launched many kinds of public low-cost housing schemes: however, many housing projects resulting from these schemes have turned into slums that do not provide a wholesome environment for families. To avoid building more slums and to provide more benefits for young buyers, the goal of this paper is to determine the correct housing attributes required for first-time homebuyers in the urban area. Three hundred questionnaires were distributed to young Malaysians in Greater Kuala Lumpur (KL), and 265 questionnaires were returned. The responses to the questionnaire revealed that accessibility and neighborhood environment play a role in the decision to own. It can also be observed that ecologically friendly homes that embrace sustainability are important considerations for prospective homebuyers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Community Land Trusts, affordable housing and community organising in
   low-income neighbourhoods
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING POLICY
AB Community Land Trusts (CLTs) offer a community-led response to housing problems and can provide affordable housing for low-income residents. Generally the academic work on CLTs remains underdeveloped, particularly in the UK, although some argue that they can be an efficient way in which to manage scarce resources while others have noted that CLTs can provide a focal point for community resistance. In this article we provide evidence on two active CLTs in inner urban areas in major US cities, New York and Boston. In Cooper Square, Lower East Side Manhattan and Dudley Street, south Boston, we see the adoption of different approaches to development suggesting that we should speak of models of CLTs rather than assuming a single operational approach. The cases we present indicate both radical and reformist responses to the state and market provision of housing and neighbourhood sustainability. They also suggest community activism can prove to be significant in securing land and the development of the CLT.

TI Assessing Supply Chain Innovations for Building Resilient Food Supply
   Chains: An Emerging Economy Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Food waste reduction and security are the main concerns of agri-food supply chains, as more than thirty-three percent of global food production is wasted or lost due to mismanagement. The ongoing challenges, including resource scarcity, climate change, waste generation, etc., need immediate actions from stakeholders to develop resilient food supply chains. Previous studies explored food supply chains and their challenges, barriers, enablers, etc. Still, there needs to be more literature on the innovations in supply chains that can build resilient food chains to last long and compete in the post-pandemic scenario. Thus, studies are also required to explore supply chain innovations for the food sector. The current research employed a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) to assess the supply chain innovations that can develop resilient food supply chains. This study is a pioneer in using the SWARA application to evaluate supply chain innovation and identify the most preferred alternatives. The results from the SWARA show that 'Business strategy innovations' are the most significant innovations that can bring resiliency to the food supply chains, followed by 'Technological innovations.' The study provides insights for decision makers to understand the significant supply chain innovations to attain resilience in food chains and help the industry to survive and sustain in the long run.

AB Improving the sustainability and affordability of housing tend to be parallel objectives among Australian policy makers. Whereas traditionally the objectives of housing affordability and housing sustainability were considered in isolation, policy responses are increasingly recognising the importance of both. However, any policy attempting to foster best practise in terms of affordability and sustainable housing must be able to link housing outcomes with the broader community; that is, affordable and sustainable housing must be socially sustainable. This paper considers social sustainability in terms of social acceptability, the minimisation of social exclusion and the fostering of social capital. Affordability is also analysed at a conceptual level before the concluding discussion attempts to overlay the two concepts in suggesting how social sustainability may be fostered in affordable and sustainable housing.

AB This presentation discusses the features and economic feasibility of a design for a detached, single-family home that is consistent with a decentralized approach to achieving net-zero water and energy outcomes and meets the criteria for affordable housing in Florida. The design integrates well-established passive approaches to water and energy conservation with new technologies in electric composting toilets and PV arrays, charge controllers, and inverters, in hybrid, grid-connected, net-zero energy systems. It is found that, even without considering potential cost reductions available through governmental programs designed to support the implementation of sustainability measures in homes, the proposed design for a net-zero water and energy single-family home would meet the affordable housing criteria in Florida's Palm Beach County for both moderate- and low-income households.

TI Light Steel Framing and Structural Concrete Walls: Sustainable
   Perspectives for Affordable Housing
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The emerging countries' society has demanded an increase on investments for affordable housing to long forgotten communities with low income - along, customarily, with the mind-set of sustainable development. In the past years, Brazil, for instance, has had an expansion on government programs that subsidize low-cost housing and, thus, studies on this area become more needed. In this paper, the sustainable aspects of two construction methods (Light Steel Framing and Structural Concrete Walls) are reviewed. The theories involving both methods and their practical approach are compared to their economical, ecological and social standards - aiming to identify the more sustainable one. Local aspects such as the supplying of materials, the work force expertise and the possible social obsolesce projections are fairly granted for both techniques. Hence, it was possible to track one construction site of the extension of approximately 1600 houses on Structure Concrete Walls and another one of a single house on Light Steel Frame, which is then extrapolated to an extent of several houses for comparison. Furthermore, based on the sustainable standards (economical, ecological and social), the Light Steel Frame mechanism has demonstrated to be superior in all standards when applied to the geographic conditions.

AB The thermal design of affordable housing in Malaysia could be ineffective and resulting from this, the majority of their occupants are not satisfied with the thermal comfort levels provided. To overcome this issue of thermal performance of building envelope, the development of sustainable blocks has been done. The blocks have been developed using locally available sustainable waste materials. The materials utilized were mainly procured from agro-industrial waste (oil palm industry) and municipal waste (waste glass). The aim of the research was to provide a better performing material for low cost houses replacing the conventional red clay bricks. In this research, the physical, mechanical and thermal performance of the sustainable building blocks were examined and compared with existing conventional building blocks. The experimental findings revealed that the newly developed Sustainable blocks have better thermal performance as compared to conventional burnt clay bricks. However, the physico-mechanical performance complies with various standard practices thus proving to be a sustainable wall material.

AB This article aims to explore the potential and limitations of participatory design and co-manufacturing processes, taking the city of Barcelona as a reference. It is characterized by an aging building stock, tourist pressure, and difficulties for citizens in accessing affordable housing. In this sense, a selection of six cases of co-design and co-manufacturing is presented, as a range of small-scale interventions that were shared and discussed in the "Debate sessions. Co-Design and Co-Fabrication in Architecture" within the Co-Hab-Raval project, which motivated this research. Thanks to these case studies, it has been possible to analyse a wide range of intervention practices. The article exposes the socioeconomic context of Barcelona and its lack of affordable housing, which motivated the practices presented. In addition, the cases are carrying out a comparative analysis based on the parameters of agents involved, the type of users' participation, and materials resource management. Finally, the results obtained highlight the relationship between the construction systems and the self-construction and reuse strategies used, as well as the importance of the plurality of agents that intervened in the design process to enrich the proposals and empower users, especially in vulnerable environments.

AB In highly-insulated buildings such as passive houses, the space-heating distribution subsystem can be simplified by reducing the number of heat emitters. In this context, the bi-directional flow through open doorways is known to be an efficient process to support the heat distribution between rooms. This process is therefore investigated using field measurements within a Norwegian passive house. The so-called large opening approximation proves to model fairly the mass flow rate, but also the convective treat transfer if the thermal stratification is accounted for. Furthermore, the discharge coefficient appears to be independent of the heater type and location in the room. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A large portion of first-time homebuyers lack adequate means to meet their needs of housing owing to home price inflation in Malaysian cities. One way to address the housing needs of urban household is to provide affordable quality homes. Drawing upon a case study of Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, this study attempts to discuss the cloud of issues related to different homeownership schemes available for first-time homebuyers. Results suggest that affordable housing should be made available at the price and locations that can be accepted by first-time homeowners. In line with the principle of sustainability, homeownership schemes for first-time homebuyers should be economically viable, socially acceptable and technically feasible.

TI Re-inventing air heating: Convenient and comfortable within the frame of
   the Passive House concept
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Buildings complying with the Passive House standard are rapidly spreading across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The underlying Passive House concept is based on a holistic approach, improving the building envelope to a degree that allows for substantial simplifications of the heating system. Passive Houses offer increased comfort at affordable costs while significantly reducing the energy consumption. The useful energy required for space heating has been reduced by ca. 80% compared with conventional (new) buildings. The overall primary energy consumption (including all services and electric appliances) has been reduced by more than 50%. Our paper introduces the Passive House standard and summarizes results of the EU project 'Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards' (CEPHEUS) with respect to energy indices and comfort. Characteristics of the combined ventilation and heating system realized in many Passive Houses are presented in detail, including results of an expert working group at the Passive House Institute and on measurements and simulations conducted at EMPA. Chances and limitations of wood stoves as supplementary heat sources in Passive Houses are discussed shortly. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB The overall Malaysian homeownership rate is declining. However, despite the introduction of various schemes and interventions, especially to the first time buyers, the gap between demand and supply is widening unabated. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the requirements of first-time home buyers. Primary data were collected through a cross-sectional survey questionnaire involving 196 homebuyers. House price, crime rate, care for the environment, availability of parking and housing types are the five main requirements of the first time home buyers in the purchase of affordable housing. An exploratory factor analysis generated five underlying clusters named in order of their significance, as price configuration, accessibility, transportation and sustainability. The findings provide fresh insights into addressing housing deficits in Malaysia and beyond. The findings will be useful to urban planners and place managers involved in housing distribution and location management. The housing developers would use this information to plan their housing delivery and design criteria, while home buyers require this to develop or adjust their buying plans. This research will enhance social well-being and increase measures to increase homeowner rates in Malaysia and elsewhere.

TI Effect of foundation designs of passive house on the thermal bridges at
   the ground
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose - This paper aims to understand the effect of different foundation designs of passive house on the resultant thermal bridges, at the junction between a wall and a slab on grade.
   Design/methodology/approach - The linear thermal transmittances of some newly developed foundations of passive house are determined. The investigated foundation designs are L-element, U-element and foundation with foam glass technique.
   Findings - It is found that the special design of passive house foundation can considerably influence the heat flow through thermal bridges. In this context, it is proposed a new foundation design of passive house, which has relatively low heat loss through thermal bridges. The results are compared with the "default" ISO values used to evaluate the effect of thermal bridges in typical buildings. It is found that there is large difference between the calculated linear thermal transmittances at the investigated foundations of passive house as compared to typical buildings.
   Practical implications - The results can hopefully be used to improve the energy efficiency of the passive house.
   Social implications - Sustainable solution of buildings.
   Originality/value - A new foundation design of passive house is suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges.

AB In recent years, building energy consumption is growing along with the accelerated pace of urbanization. Inside this building energy consumption, conventional heating and ventilation is dominant. In order to save energy consumption, passive house technology has been applied to the Chinese building successfully, so it is particularly important that we study and improve domestic passive buildings. This article contains analysis of three cases about typical passive house, and concluds that their common characteristics and assessment of China's current passive house development prospects.

TI Resilience and Livelihoods in Supply Chains (RELISC): An Analytical
   Framework for the Development and Resilience of the UK Wood Fuel Sector
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Bioenergy is an important renewable energy source in the UK, but the bioenergy industry and in particular the wood fuel sub sector, is relatively under-developed. Socioeconomic factors have been identified as critical for facilitating deployment levels and sustainable development. However, previous studies have mostly assessed these factors using quantitative methods and models, which are limited in assessing pertinent contextual factors such as institutional/regulatory governance, supply chain structure and governance, capital resource availability as well as actor decisions. As a step further, this research engages with these under-explored aspects of the system by developing a new analytical framework: the Resilience and Livelihoods in Supply Chains (RELISC) framework, which was designed by linking Value Chain Analysis, the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach and a supply chain resilience framework. Its application to a UK wood fuel supply chain produced useful insights. For example, the structure of the chain revealed a high level of dependency on a particular end user and contractor. Key institutional governance was critical in sustaining natural resources and providing access to finance. Internal supply chain governance was limited in ensuring the sustainability of resources and lack of actor awareness and interest were also limiting factors. In addition, five capital analyses revealed gaps in skills, networking and physical infrastructure. Finally, the design of the novel RELISC framework enables it to engage with diverse aspects of the system holistically and its application generated practical recommendations and strategies for supply chain resilience and sector growth, which are useful and applicable to other emerging sectors.

AB The increasing worldwide demand for affordable housing and sustainable development leads to highly needed sustainable solutions in the housing sector. Households in the middle-income range struggle to secure the right sustainable home within their budget. In response to the Malaysian Eleventh National Plan (2016-2020), importance is given for every citizen to have affordable housing with sustainable elements, which leads to the trend of integrating affordability housing criteria in sustainable housing development. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the critical challenges of the integration of affordable and sustainable housing from the economic, environmental, and social perspectives of the middle-income group. However, this study focuses mainly on the challenges from economic perspectives. The semi-structured interview approach was employed involving several housing developers in the Klang Valley area as the sustainable concept is still early in Malaysia. Results revealed that the high cost of sustainable development, financial constraints of developers, lack of design, technology and expertise, financial constraints, lack of government enforcement and incentives, lack of commitment from stakeholders are the key challenges in developing affordable and sustainable housing. The outcomes of this study will hopefully serve to offer several guidelines for construction players to enhance the quality of life for sustainable communities via the Sustainable Affordable Housing Scheme.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB The scaling up of a social enterprise is a dynamic process that often involves tensions resulting from the divergent social and business logics inherently present in social enterprises. We analysed extensive data covering a period of more than 10 years' journey of an affordable housing finance organisation in India. We identify four phases of the scaling up process of the venture and highlight three areas where the social-business tensions arise in: (i) human resources, (ii) organising and (iii) investor expectations. Our process model illustrates how the organisation developed different responses to mitigate these tensions in different phases and avoid mission drift. These responses include prioritising the social side, half-hearted balancing, accepting growth limitation and anticipating social-business tensions.

TI Study on the Impact of Supply Chain Dynamic Capabilities on Long-Term
   Performance of Enterprises
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The risk of frequent disasters is becoming a huge challenge for enterprises and their supply chains. In particular, sudden global public health events have brought a great test to the supply chain. How to make sustainable planning and preparedness and smoothly carry out supply chain operations and obtain sustainable firm performance in the complex market environment requires urgent attention from industries and academia. The different effects of supply chain operational capability and dynamic capability on the long-term performance and short-term performance of enterprises are still unclear; therefore, a model was established to discuss this. Based on the theory of dynamic capability, a relational model between supply chain dynamic capability, supply chain operational capability, and firm performance was constructed, a hypothesis testing method and Amos software were used to verify the set model, and the mechanisms of supply chain dynamic capability and supply chain operational capability on firm performance were discussed. The empirical results show that supply chain operational capability has a mediating effect on supply chain dynamic capability and firm performance, and supply chain dynamic capability has a moderating impact on supply chain operational capability and firm performance. The supply chain and its enterprises should cultivate and continuously improve the supply chain dynamic capability as soon as possible, so that in the face of emergencies, the supply chain operation capability can be reasonably configured to avoid damage, improve firm performance, and gain competitive advantages.

TI The credit crunch and subsidized low-income housing: the UK and US

SO JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper examines how the mortgage crisis and subsequent recession have affected subsidized rental housing in the United Kingdom and the United States. These two nations approach the housing needs of low-income households in very different ways and to very different degrees. In the UK, non-profit housing associations are pivotal to the production and management of affordable rental housing; in the US, the affordable housing system revolves mostly around a single program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Yet the crisis destabilized key parts of both countries' subsidy systems and raised important questions about their sustainability in the future. The UK responded sooner and arguably more effectively than the US to the crisis. However, over the longer term, the prospects for affordable housing development are likely to be more difficult in the UK than in the US.

Prior circular economy studies are neglecting the multi-loop supply chain system activities that broaden the economic benefits and rarely link the activities to economic benefits, especially mostly dealt with optimization of resource use by minimizing waste, emissions, energy leakage, and resource input. This study points out to monitor the multi-level supply chain system effects on circular economy diffusion effects using life cycle assessment tool. A challenge now to the circular economy community is to involve the attributes in multi-level supply chain system and its activities.

TI Localization of state policy: Shandong's experience in financing Cheap
   Rental Housing in urban China
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB China's urban housing sector has undergone a tremendous transition from a centrally-controlled economy to a socialist market-oriented scheme as a consequence of evolutionary processes of institutional change. By studying the institutions governing Cheap Rental Housing (CRH) financing, this paper analyses the intermediary role of the provincial government of Shandong in implementing centrally initiated government policies in urban China. Shandong's experience in leveraging Land Use Right Leasing and Housing Provident Funds to fund local CRH schemes amplifies that urban governance structure has been evolving where governments at sub-national levels assume an increasingly important function in executing national policies. The rising participation of provincial governments in affordable housing sector demonstrates that Chinese state can no longer be considered as a single superpower that overrides the role of local governments. The corollary of the changing power matrix in China shows that governments at each level coordinate and collaborate through the new institutional arrangements that have evolved in the planning and delivery of affordable houses. However, intra-governmental political and fiscal structures need to be increasingly calibrated to balance resource allocation to make CRH development in urban China more sustainable.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine organizational and environmental (competition, capital scarcity and organization of labor) factors that affect firms' innovation activities within the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach This study empirically examines the factors that affect firms' innovation activities using firm-level data from the last round of Business Environment Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS). The analysis covers major supply chain functions: production, delivery and support systems. Findings The study shows that drivers of innovation vary with the type of innovation activity; as such, innovation efforts across supply chain functions should prioritize strategic resources that will create competitive advantages. Our results also reveal that sustainability efforts in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) region should prioritize labor market reforms over capital market reforms. Originality/value Current research on innovation and supply chain issues does not explicitly analyze innovations that occur in different sustainable supply chain functions, and empirical studies that focus on the determinants of innovations in the supply chain network are very limited. The data used in this study cover 30 economies in EECA, many of which are low- and middle-income countries, and thus contribute to the implementation of sustainable practices in developing countries.

AB Throughout the nineteenth century, in the field of building construction, new materials and techniques, allied with tools for calculation and analysis, allowed the dimensions of clear span, enclosed space to increase and for new configurations of space to be proposed. The themes have been the focus of extensive study in works from some architectural authors. In the intervening years other studies have begun to fill in many gaps. For example, a study of the general effect of development in central heating and ventilation on architectural design in the nineteenth century. This provides the point of departure for this sketch of the architectural environment as it evolved from the enlightenment to the threshold of Modernity. (Hawkes, D 2008). So, how can community life be encouraged, how can natural ventilation be improved and the reliance on air conditioning be reduced, how can the heat effect be reduced, how can energy consumption, CO2 emissions be cut and other air pollution be reduced, how can vegetation be increased and how can some of the benefits of landed living be made available to apartment dwellers? (Bay, J.H & Ong, B.L 2006).
   This paper will discuss the issues of the environment and the sustainability in the housing design of the affordable housing.

TI Improving sustainability of affordable housing using innovative
   technologies: Case study of SIAH-Livable
SO SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB Rapid urbanization presents a major challenge in achieving affordable and sustainable housing. In the face of the problem, rapid urbanisation represents, there is room for innovation. Advance-ments in sustainable design methods, new materials, and innovative building technologies offer potential solutions for developing sustainable, innovative, and affordable housing (SIAH). This study investigates various sustainable design techniques, materials, and technologies suitable for designing SIAH in the South African climate in concordance with local building codes and reg-ulations. The study compares the building performance of SIAH-Livable, as assessed by energy embodied, energy demand, and water usage, with that of conventional low-cost housing using the EDGE Buildings App. The results validate that SIAH-Livable building performance is significantly less water and energy, reducing consumption by 55.17% and 21.06%, respectively. Additionally, SIAH-Livable exhibits a noTable 66.9% reduction in embodied energy levels while remaining within the construction cost range defined by the South African government for low-cost housing. Furthermore, the analysis confirms that appropriate design techniques, new materials, and technologies not only enhance the sustainability of the house but also improve its affordability by reducing lifecycle costs. The study concludes that sustainable design techniques, including pas-sive design, the use of recycled and local materials, and socio-technical innovations, are effective means of enhancing the sustainability and affordability of housing, contributing to the devel-opment of SIAH. Importantly, this research establishes the association between sustainability and affordability in South African housing design, offering insights that can be adapted and applied to other African countries.

TI Performance Measurement Systems for Circular Supply Chain Management:
   Current State of Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB With circular supply chain management, the need arises to measure circularity as well as economic, environmental, and social performance. This places higher demands on performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management. The current paper studies the extent to which performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management can meet these higher demands. To gain this insight, a systematic literature review is conducted. Moreover, existing definitions of circular supply chain management are reviewed and an improved definition of circular supply chain management is developed. The current paper finds, among other things, that the literature on performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management is scarce. Moreover, most of the available performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management have not been tested in practice and are therefore still in an early phase of development. Furthermore, none of the available performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management meet the requirements for effective performance measurement systems. More specifically, including interdependencies between performance measures is a requirement that none of the performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management can meet. Including interdependencies would better support the complex decision making that arises in circular supply chain management and enable one to challenge strategic assumptions about the improvement of circularity, economic, environmental, and social performance in parallel.</p>

TI Old apartments and new plans: reconciling planning and housing goals in
   two Texas cities
SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB Increasingly, cities in rapidly growing regions are promoting redevelopment to achieve denser, mixed use patterns thought crucial to environmental sustainability. Redevelopment often threatens older apartments, built in the 1970s and early 1980s during a building boom fostered by federal tax incentives. While often these aging apartments are a poor fit for the family households who inhabit them, they have become the largest stock of rental housing affordable to very low income residents. Replacing this stock of centrally located, transit accessible affordable housing would be extraordinarily expensive. City planners view these complexes as the opposite of the mixed use, pedestrian-friendly development needed in cities. Affordable housing agencies are concerned with preserving existing subsidized housing. Yet arguably, both planners and housers should be concerned about the loss of these aging apartments. Displacement of large numbers of low-income transit dependent residents from the central core of cities works against planners' environmental goals and adds to the number of households in need of subsidized housing. It also undermines existing lowincome communities. This paper examines the prospects for preservation of older, affordable apartments in Dallas and Austin, chosen to contrast the role that comprehensive planning might play in bridging housing and planning goals.

TI Life cycle cost of different Walling material used for affordable
   housing in tropics
SO CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
AB The energy consumption of affordable housing industry plays a vital role in the environmental sustainability, waste generation and energy consumption. The development of sustainable housing construction methodology helps its country's economic development and sustainable development. Wall and roof are the most significant building component in a dwelling unit. The walling materials can determine the cost of the building as well as the total life cycle cost of a dwelling unit. In this study, the total life cycle cost of a basic dwelling unit in Sri Lanka, made of mostly available walling materials such as Brick, Hollow cement block, and Cabook, the Mud concrete blocks were calculated by using energy accounting hierarchical structure. The life cycle cost incurred due to change in above-mentioned walling materials were calculated and measured. Additionally, total LCC compared and analyzed.
   The results show that mud concrete block is the most suitable walling material. The brick has the highest account for the embedded energy. The hollow cement block is the worse building materials in tropics and its carbon footprint is comparatively higher. Even though the brick has higher embedded energy and construction cost, in a long run brick is less expensive than hollow cement block and Cabook walling material. Concluding, mud concrete block is comparatively most sustainable walling material for building affordable housing in tropics.

SO INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT FOR HIGHLY ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOUSING:
   OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF PASSIVE HOUSES
SE Sustainable Urban Areas
AB The house construction sector in Europe is facing the need to meet stricter energy requirements. For example, some customers are demanding passive houses with almost no demand for space heating. Passive house quality assurance systems have been introduced to certify the energy performance of such houses. The aim of this study was to identify opportunities for improving passive house certification in line with customer's comfort expectations.
   Questionnaires, site visits and interviews were carried out to identify and assess the comfort concerns of owner-occupiers in certified single-family passive houses in Flanders, northern Belgium. The results show that certified passive houses in Flanders are well rated and perceived as very comfortable. However, there were some cases where comfort concerns were expressed related to perceived flaws in the design or construction of the building services. In particular, the study recommends incorporating criteria for the planning and installation of user-friendly ventilation systems into passive house certification and providing end-users with better information.

TI The role of supply chain leadership in the learning of sustainable
   practice: toward an integrated framework
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is a topic that has become increasingly important in recent years. However, very few papers focus on studying SSCM from both leadership and learning perspectives. In this research, we carry out a content-based literature review on the intersections of Supply Chain leadership, Supply Chain Learning and SSCM; we propose a conceptual framework on how focal companies assuming a leadership role initiate and disseminate sustainable practices in their supply chains. Three types of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategies (i.e., reactive, contributive and proactive) have been identified in this research based on four dimensions of SSCM governance, supply chain learning, supply chain leadership and SSCM performance. It is argued that two new constructs of supply chain learning and supply chain leadership are an integral part of the SSCM conceptual framework developed from the literature and have significant implication to our understanding of SSCM.

SO INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
AB This article reviews the various housing schemes implemented in India post-independence. This year marking the 75 years of independence, the demand for affordable housing for economically weaker sections and low-income group are at stake in the country. In achieving "Housing for all " in the rapidly urbanizing Indian context, Textile reinforced concrete (TRC) technology promises to be environmentally and economically "affordable " consuming significantly fewer quantities of building materials with high embodied energy. Textile reinforced concrete is the most durable, lightweight, and highly ductile structural component with its non-corrosive textiles replacing the conventional steel reinforcement used, and it can be the most feasible solution to the problem of implementing affordable housing in urban India. TRC has been an excellent solution for the retrofitting and strengthening of existing infrastructures paving its progressive research direction of using this as a load-bearing structural component. With a substantially lower carbon footprint than conventional RCC structures, TRC offers better potential for sustainability. Furthermore, this article proposes a futuristic direction to enhance the research on the application of TRC as a structural component for prefabricated low-cost housing.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Sustainable Development Goals and circular economy are two critical aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They both seek to reduce the waste of natural resources and enhance society's social, economic, and environmental goals. This study aims to identify, develop, test, and verify the significant antecedents that affect the adoption of supply chain analytics and its consequences for achieving the circular economy. We have divided the conceptual framework into two parts. In the first part, the relationship among data integration and scalability, organizational readiness, and policies and regulations as Technological-Organizational-Environmental factors as antecedents in adopting supply chain analytics. In the second part, the dynamic capabilities view grounded the relationship among supply chain analytics, supply chain integration, and sustainable supply chain flexibility effect directly and indirectly on the circular economy. Data have been collected using the survey method from 231 respondents from the manufacturing industry in Pakistan. Data have been analyzed using (i) partial least square structure equation modeling (ii) and artificial neural network approaches. The empirical findings proved that antecedents (data integrity and scalability, organizational readiness, and policy and regulation) and consequences (supply chain integration and sustainable supply chain flexibility) of supply chain analytics adoption would improve the circular economy performance. Additionally, artificial neural networks have supported these relationships. The adoption of supply chain analytics will enable organizations to supply chain integration. Additionally, organizations with more integration and analytics in their operations tend to have more flexibility and a circular economy. Moreover, organizations and society will obtain social, economic, and environmental benefits and reduce wastage and negative environmental impacts.

TI How Does Supply Chain Resilience Affect Supply Chain Performance? The
   Mediating Effect of Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, interruption or failure events have occurred due to frequent natural disasters, the outbreak of COVID-19, policy environment turbulence, an increasingly complex business environment, and the increasingly fragile global supply chain. This has reduced the efficiency of supply chains and customer service quality and increased operating costs, creating new requirements for supply chain flexibility and sustainability. When investigating 21 companies based on 200 questionnaires and a structural equation model analysis, the results showed that the elasticity of the supply chain for supply chain sustainability, economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environment sustainability has an obvious positive effect: supply chain sustainability has an obvious positive effect on supply chain performance. Supply chain resilience has no direct positive effect on supply chain performance, but it has a strong indirect effect on supply chain performance under the mediating effect of supply chain sustainability. In view of this, in order to create sustainable supply chain development and improve the performances of supply chains, it is necessary to establish the awareness of risk prevention, root the risk culture in supply chain network organization, and improve supply chain resilience in multiple dimensions. Enterprises in the supply chain should continue to build their resilience and establish effective strategies to integrate supply chains. The intermediary role of sustainability in supply chains and of supply chain flexibility in supply chain performance shows the influence of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable angles, such as the implementation of supply chain management, the maximization of the interests of the whole supply chain, improving the ability of supply chain enterprises to innovate and develop, establishing customer awareness, and enhancing humanistic ideas. Dynamic selection of supply chain partners while focusing on their green performance promotes the green development of supply chain enterprises.

TI Housing need assessments in San Francisco, Vancouver, and Melbourne:
   normative science or neoliberal alchemy?
SO HOUSING STUDIES
AB Governments in much of the Global North have responded to dramatic increases in house prices and rents by setting supply-side targets for new housing in regional and local plans, based on calculations of need. We apply social constructionism to assess widely divergent needs assessments underlying housing strategies in San Francisco, US; Vancouver, Canada; and Melbourne, Australia. In San Francisco, authorities use an approach required by the state government that ignores overcrowding and other 'invisible' criteria. In Vancouver, authorities have taken an ambitious approach that goes beyond a minimum quantum of affordable housing to discuss limits to market production. In Melbourne, the state government has chosen to ignore its own commissioned needs assessment to de-prioritize concerns around affordable housing shortages. We conclude by recommending that planners apply greater rigor in housing needs assessments, that can inform public debates around more equitable housing policy.

AB Stricter environmental regulations on livestock production pollution have changed the sustainable practices of livestock supply chain stakeholders. By adopting three cases in China's livestock supply chain, this study explores how supply chain coordination facilitates sustainable development of livestock production in China. It is found that close supply chain coordination and the capabilities of the core companies jointly contribute to supply chain sustainability. Thus, this research has theoretical significance in explaining the roles of supply chain coordination and core company capabilities in driving supply chain sustainability, which is not completely understood thus far. This study also has practical implications for livestock supply chain stakeholders and the government in terms of improving supply chain sustainability via closer supply chain coordination and enhancing the capabilities of the core companies involved.

SO HOUSING STUDIES
AB This paper describes a project exploring the viability in Australia of increasing the supply of small, affordable housing to those with limited income and wealth and a desire to live in homes that integrate with the community in meaningful ways and minimise consumption of building materials, land and energy. The research context is the increasing marketing and media coverage of tiny homes, which has prompted questions about whether such houses can offer an alternative affordable housing model. The project focused on four key issues: community integration, building and design, regulatory planning barriers, and financing and affordability. A combination of interviews, focus groups, and system thinking workshops was used to collect the views of stakeholders across the housing sector, including potential residents. Results indicate that a radical shift is needed from the planning authorities, housing supply and finance sector to enable the provision of affordable and sustainable compact homes that are adaptable to all stages of life.

TI A framework & dynamic model for reform of residential land supply policy
   in urban China
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Urban residential land supply is both driven by and significantly influences urbanisation processes, the optimisation of which are necessary to address housing issues. At present, China's urban housing system has three major problems, namely a shortage of affordable housing, rapidly increasing prices for regular commodity housing, and an under-supply, relative to market demands, of high-end commodity housing, calling into question the effectiveness of existing land supply policies. This paper first reviews policies governing residential land supply and then considers these policies in light of findings from semi-structured interviews conducted with key actors and a survey of households in Hangzhou, a city of more than nine million in eastern China. These analyses show that although the Chinese government has undertaken steps to reform land use allocation and increase housing affordability in its cities, significant opportunities for reform remain in both affordable and commodity housing sectors.
   Results from this study aid in formulation of a framework for residential land supply and a dynamic model for reform for Chinese governments to undertake to integrate housing provision across a range of household income and housing type classifications. The model demonstrates how reformation of the residential land supply system through improvements to the elasticity of residential land supply, optimisation of land supply for affordable housing, deregulation of land supply for and taxation of high-end commodity housing will significantly ease housing stress within Chinese cities. Finally, international experience indicates that the Chinese government can leverage revenues to acquire or otherwise support construction of additional affordable housing, with the in helping to arrest housing price inflation while achieving socialist ideals..

SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB Passive House buildings with an annual energy demand of less than 15 kWh/m(2)a (i.e. kWh/m(2) per annum) can help Canada and other countries achieve thermal comfort with minimum energy use and carbon footprint through meticulous design and selection of highly efficient building envelope elements and appliances. Shipping container based passive houses can reduce the cost of passive house construction and also promote recycling. In this paper, a passive house built using shipping containers, originally designed for Victoria, BC, Canada, is analyzed using Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software in different climactic zones of Canada. The locations under consideration are: Halifax (Cool-Temperate), Toronto (Cold-Temperate), Edmonton (Cold), and Yellowknife (Arctic-Climate). This paper critically examines the energy demand changes in various climate zones and make necessary modifications to the design to achieve passive house energy performance requirements in selected climates. Results show that with modified designs shipping container passive houses can meet passive house requirements, except in the Arctic-Climate of Yellowknife.

TI Community participation as a tool for conservation planning and historic
   preservation: the case of "Community As A Campus" (CAAC)
SO JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB The objective of this article is to examine a community planning approach to urban conservation and rehabilitation. In Chicago, like in many other cities across the USA, there has been an unequal distribution of school closures in minority neighbourhoods with higher than average poverty rates. The closure of school buildings, most with historical value, has destabilizing effects in communities, including the loss of public assets, vacancies, and disinvestment. In neighbourhoods experiencing rent increases, such as with Humboldt Park, the use of historic properties can provide an opportunity to develop affordable housing and avoid displacement. This case study seeks to demonstrate how a grassroots organization in a gentrifying neighbourhood created their own participatory planning process to obtain a surplus school building and reuse it as a "teacher's village". The reuse plan includes affordable housing targeted primarily at school teachers, office space dedicated to educational-community-related uses, a caf, open to the public, and a number of other amenities. The overall development plan seeks to make significant upgrades to allow the building to operate sustainably for years to come. The building is expected to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places and will require a unique and sensitive approach to creating an inspiring, collaborative, and community-oriented development. The methodology employed in this article is based on Participatory Action Research and includes field notes and interviews. The researcher engaged as a participant-observer and committee member for about 1.5 years with "Community As A Campus"-the initiative dedicated to envisioning and planning the redevelopment project.

For empirical investigation, data were collected from employees working in manufacturing firms. For inferential analysis 341 valid responses were used. Results indicate that supply chain innovation is predicted by big data analytic capability, big data analytic staff capability, employee development, employee empowerment and employee involvement and explained large variance R-2 0.538 % in measuring supply chain innovativeness. Practically, this research suggests that policy makers should focus on supply chain innovativeness, big data analytics, big data analytics staff capability and supply chain connectivity to enhance sustainable performance in supply chain operations. Theoretically, this research has synthesized literature and develops an integrated research model that combines technology and human resource factors altogether to investigate supply chain innovation and sustainability in supply chain performance.

AB New private property investments in Africa's cities are on the rise, often manifested as comprehensively planned urban extensions. Greater Accra has several competing city projects under development, potentially launching new city-making trajectories and competitive struggles among rival projects. This article assesses the rationale and early evolution of Ghana's largest, most ambitious project the Ningo-Prampram Urban Extension, aiming to accommodate 1.5 million people. Supported by UN-Habitat, international consultants, government, and local Chiefs, the constellation of actors supports a public-private partnership to engage in urban entrepreneurialism, underpinned by sustainable development features and promising increased global connectivity. However, this project raises socio-spatial contradictions with regard to how affordable housing, an airport city and other developments can augment Accra's development. Global economy articulation as well as intra-city connectivity is promised but at its peril it amplifies sprawl so that the Accra City Region evolves into a string of beads along the Trans-West African Highway.

The research model of this study was empirically tested with 309 responses collected from supply chain managers. Results revealed that supply chain resilience is measured with supply chain intelligence, supply chain communication, leadership commitment, risk management orientation, supply chain capability and network complexity and demonstrated a substantial variance R-2 of 0.548% towards supply chain resilience. Practically, this study suggests that supply chain managers should focus on factors such as big data analytics, risk management orientation,1 supply chain communication and leadership commitment to enhance supply chain resilience and sustainable supply chain performance.

CL Opatija, CROATIA
AB The paper presents low energy and passive house architectural energy concept. projects and realizations of passive houses in Croatia. Low energy and passive house energy standards of building are relevant for sustainable development.
   The Croatian Solar House (CSH) is a national technological-development project by a group of authors, which is based on passive house standard as an energy-terms point of departure. The House CV1 is a wood-made passive house under construction, while the House M4 is the first passive house in Croatia made in poro-concrete and reienforced concrete made ceilling slabs. Both houses comply with the heating energy consumption requirements under the passive house definition, i.e., the annual consumption does not exceed 15 kWh/m(2). These houses are also referred to as "houses without heating", "houses with thermal comfort without heating" or "one-liter houses" because their consumption is equivalent to one liter of fuel oil by one square meter a year. Assuming the high-value thermal protection, passive house is equipped with an installation system which houses a heat pump and ventialtion system for continuous introduction of fresh air indoors. The use of renewable energy sources enabled the accomplishment by far the biggest energy savings in the construction industry, ensuring optimal conditionsfor healthy living without harmful gas emissions.
   Since 1990 there is an exponential growth of constructed passive houses in Europe. The research project - program of the European Union: Cost Efficiency of Passive Houses as European Union Standard (CEPHEUS) has confirmed, by scientific monitoring during severaal years, the energy and cost-efficiency of such architecture and construction model. Therefore the low energy and passive house is proposed as a standard for residential architecture and construction, but also for general construction of all functional types of nonresidential architecture. The accomplished energy efficiency and already corroborated favorable investment effectiveness lead to new forms of incentives to such construction style and relevant changes of long-term energy strategies in the EU member states.

TI Waste-to-energy supply chain management on circular economy capability:
   An empirical study
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB The circular economy initiative has driven the agriculture and agro-based industry to compost production waste into clean energy. However, the company ability to turn waste into energy requires well-managed energy supply chain systems. The challenges to produce clean energy through the biorefinery process in the Waste-to-Energy (WTE) supply chain led to less capable companies implementing the circular economy. This study aims to develop the theoretical-mediating of the WTE supply chain that examine the life cycle assessment (LCA), economic potential cycle (EPC) and value chain analysis (VCA) as enablers of circular economy capability (CEC). To investigate the current WTE supply chain management practices on agriculture and agro-based industry in Malaysia, this study has collected survey data from the companies that turn waste products into bio-energy and actively practices sustainable waste management. This study found that the enablers have a significant and positive impact on WTC supply chain practices and CEC. The results indicate that WTC supply chain practices have mediated the direct path from LCA and CEC. Our findings have extended the CEC's theoretical-mediating impact to explain how the agricultural and agro-based industries transform waste into clean energy. We suggest that the agro-based industry monitor the WTE practice consistently and strategically explore the opportunity to obtain benefits from clean energy while protecting the environment. Therefore, the abundant agricultural biomass waste in the developing countries should be converted into clean energy and support the business operations while also generating new income strategically.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

On this occasion, Professor Feist founded the PassivHaus Institute (PHI), an independent research institute that has played ever since a crucial role in the development of the Passive House concept based on super-insulation coupled with almost zero thermal bridges, appropriate orientation, good sizing of windows, airtightness.. Generally, for super insulated buildings, a special attention must be paid to thermal bridges. This paper presents a numerical evaluation of thermal bridges that are identified in the design of a Passive House located in South of Romania and made with locally available materials. Results lead to the conclusion that the thermal bridges associated with the design and climatic conditions considered here are negligible, the building complying thus with the PHI standard.

TI Product-service systems business models for circular supply chains
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB Shifting supply chains from linear to closed-loop models is an important step towards circular economy. This paper investigates business model innovation for circular supply chains, and proposes that product-service systems (PSS) business models can enhance the circularity of supply chains through value creation in inner circles, circling long and cascading use circles. It adopts an exploratory case study method of a large Chinese manufacturing firm operating a traditional product-based business model and three types of PSS business models (i.e. product-, use- and result-oriented PSSs). The supply chain operations of the four distinct business models are analysed and their associated circularities are discussed. The findings show that business models akin to result-oriented PSS, have tighter and more efficient cycles of supply chain operations; which means, the repair, reuse and remanufacturing system is faster and the rate is higher. This research contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between business model innovation and supply chain circularity.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB This study develops a supply chain finance adoption model to investigate the key drivers and corresponding outcomes of supply chain finance adoption decisions. We examine the impacts of perceived capital pressure, order fulfillment cycle, and inventory turnover cycle on three types of supply chain finance adoption (accounts receivable finance, inventory finance, accounts payable finance). In addition, we examine the impacts of three types supply chain finance adoption on the performance of supply chain cost reduction. We use data collected from 683 companies of eight industries in China to test our proposed relationships. The results show that perceived capital pressure and order fulfillment cycle are significant predictors of supply chain finance adoption decisions. Accounts receivable finance and inventory finance significantly influence supply chain cost reduction. This study is one of the first attempts to conduct large sample empirical investigation in supply chain finance research. Our findings enhance the understanding of supply chain finance adoption for both academics and practitioners.

TI Decoding the elemental arcs of superior performance in sustainable
   supply chains A knowledge-based view
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to delve into the intricate depths surrounding the development of sustainable supply chains by conceptualizing the elemental aspects of superior performance in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual in nature and is grounded in the theories of SSCM and knowledge-based view. Findings The findings outline the elemental background processes governing the implementation of SSCM practices and superior performance outcomes. The conceptualization suggests that the superior performance of a sustainable supply chain is elementally dependent on the intricate efforts - to enrich the supply chain knowledge base with perspectives on SSCM. Thereby, these intricate efforts are delineated along the arcs of supply chain leadership, supply chain learning orientation, supply chain knowledge management (SCKM) and supply chain knowledge transfer. As such, while an SSCM orientation within the supply chain leadership is helpful in offsetting the inertia among the supply chain members to channelize intricate efforts in SSCM, the SSCM-based supply chain learning orientation further orientates the SSCM efforts of supply chain members toward the excavation of new knowledge in the frame of SSCM. Subsequently, the arcs of SSCM-based SCKM and SSCM-based supply chain knowledge transfer characterize the finer spaces of knowledge excavating actions, essential for enriching the supply chain knowledge base with perspectives on SSCM. Originality/value This conceptualization facilitates intriguing theoretical explanations to the linkage between SSCM implementation and superior performance outcomes. Specifically, from the knowledge-based angle, it delineates the root causes governing the superior/inferior nature of SSCM outcomes.

SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED
   SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB Merging spaces and deleting unnecessary activities are essential mechanisms to minimize the cost of affordable housing. However, their act must meet the multiple aspects of sustainability both in its economic and social aspects (by reducing the house area within acceptable limits of the resident adaptation to the implemented design). However, there is still a lack of local studies that clarify the role, ranges, and procedures for applying these concepts and the relationship between them in influencing the design and controlling its spaces areas. Accordingly, this research aims to "determine the role and the influence of each of the two mechanisms in spaces rationalization for sustainable urban housing" and the association of their effect with the variables of the area and dimensions of the residential plot. The research assumes that determining the building area can create a lot of modalities that govern the merging and cancellation in providing housing activities. To achieve this goal, a field study was conducted for a group of residential houses of the limited plot area within different proportions from the private urban residential sector of the city of Mosul, assuming that these designs can be considered as a realistic reference to how these procedures influence house design.

Meanwhile the social, cultural, ethical, psychological, emotional, religious and ethnic aspects operating over the course of the existence of a Passive House are given minimal attention or are ignored entirely. However, all the aspects mentioned must be analyzed in an integrated manner during the time a Passive House is in existence. The author of this chapter along with colleagues implemented this goal while they participated in two Intelligent Energy Europe programs, the NorthPass and the IDES-EDU projects. The Passive House model for quantitative and qualitative analyses and its intelligent system was developed during the time of these projects. The model and intelligent system are briefly described in this chapter, which ends with a case study.

AB It is not easy to get a decent housing for low-income people (LIP) in the cities of Indonesia due to the limitation of land available for development in the urban areas allows the speculators to retain the benefits of land in an unregulated commodity business. This study aims to examine and analyze the establishment of land bank for ensuring the implementation of more prosperous, fair sharing and sustainable land management. The observational method of reviewing the land use issues, land bank models and legal basis was performed to understand the eligibility of land bank in management of land use to serve public interest of infrastructure construction and development of affordable housing for LIP in urban areas. The establishment of land bank institution in Indonesia is considered important to accommodate the need of lands in urban areas for a wide array of purposes. The analysis of landless housing prices in the Jabodetabek region for the development of five-story residential building can save more than 50% of income toward the necessity of affordable housing for LIP. The finding of this study may provide a contribution to get better understanding on the decision making process of sustainable land management at all levels of government in Indonesia particularly by the provincial government of Special Capital Territory of Jakarta.

TI Sustainable housing financing model to reduce South Africa housing
   deficit
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB Purpose - This study aims to identify and establish effective housing financing concepts to be adopted by government in achieving its mandate of providing sustainable affordable housing for the poor to decrease the building of shacks, as well as proposing solutions to the housing deficit in South Africa. A rise in demand and shortage in supply of housing calls for the need to address issues of affordable housing in South Africa, and developing countries in general, to ensure a stable and promising future for poor families.
   Design/methodology/approach - Literature has revealed that the South African government, at all levels, accorded high priority to the provision of low-cost housing. Thus, government has adopted subsidy payment as a method of financing affordable housing to ensure that houses are allocated free to the beneficiaries. This also addresses the historically race-based inequalities of the past, but unfortunately, this has not been fully realised. This study uses a sequential mixed method approach, where private housing developers and general building contractors were the research participants. The qualitative data were analysed using a case-by-case analysis, and quantitative data were analysed using a descriptive statistical technique on SPSS.
   Findings - The results of the qualitative analysis reveal a gross abuse of the housing subsidies system by the beneficiaries of government-funded housing in South Africa. This is evident from illegal sale of the houses below market value. This has led to a continual building of shacks and an increased number of people on the housing waiting list instead of a decrease in the housing deficit. The results from quantitative analysis affirm the use of "Mortgage Payment Subsidies, Mortgage Payment Deductions, Down-Payment Grant and Mortgage Interest Deductions" as viable alternatives to subsidy payment currently in use to finance affordable housing projects by the South African Government.
   Practical implications - At the moment, the focus of the South African National Government is continual provision of free housing to the historically disadvantage citizens, but the housing financing method being used encourages unapproved transfer of ownership in the affordable housing sector. This study thus recommends the use of an all-inclusive housing financing method that requires a monetary contribution from the beneficiaries to enable them take control of the process.
   Originality/value - The relational interface model proposed in this study will reduce pressure on government budgetary provision for housing and guarantee quick return of private developers' investment in housing. Government must, as a matter of urgency, launch a continuous awareness programme to educate the low-income population on the value and the long-term benefits of the housing.

SO URBAN SCIENCE
AB Transit-oriented development (TOD) has become a leading model of urban planning worldwide that promises to meet a broad range of local and regional objectives: improving mobility, expanding ridership, attracting investment, reducing urban poverty, improving quality of life, making affordable housing and fostering urban integration. At the same time, the implementation of TOD in many cities has raised concerns about gentrification, displacement, re-segregation, and more polarization. This article aims to shed light on these issues by bringing together previously disparate literature that mentions these contradictions and discusses policymakers' hopes and critics' concern for the implementation of a newly started TOD project in a universal housing system in Rosengard-a segregated, low-income neighborhood in Malmo, Sweden. Although policy advocates view the project as a significant development strategy for a more sustainable Malmo, there are also real concerns about gentrification and the potential displacement of low-income residents. Furthermore, the mixed-methods study showes how integration might be achieved, but concerns have arisen about the possible exclusion of the current low-income residents, which brings up issues of inequality, representation of poverty, and marginalization.

TI Supply-Chain Finance and Investment Efficiency: The Perspective of
   Sustainable Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Recent debates regarding supply-chain finance have separated financial attributes from supply-chain attributes, ignoring their unity and the utilization efficiency of funds after financing. Can supply-chain finance affect corporate investment efficiency? There is still insufficient research in existing studies. In this paper, multiple regression analysis is used on 9757 listed companies in China for the period 2010-2020, to empirically test the impact of supply-chain finance on investment efficiency by integrating financial and supply-chain attributes of supply-chain finance, and we further analyze its mechanism. The results show that supply-chain finance can alleviate corporate under-investment and inhibit over-investment. The relationship is stronger for nonstate-owned corporations and is stronger when corporations operate in a superior information environment. Further, financial constraint plays an intermediary role between supply-chain finance and under-investment, while corporate social responsibility plays an intermediary role between supply-chain finance and over-investment. This study enriches the relevant research on the economic consequences of supply-chain finance, and provides new evidence for how supply-chain finance can promote the high-quality development of the real economy.

In this research, we carry out a content-based literature review on the intersections of Supply Chain leadership, Supply Chain Learning and SSCM; we propose a conceptual framework on how focal companies assuming a leadership role initiate and disseminate sustainable practices in their supply chains. Three types of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategies (i.e., reactive, contributive and proactive) have been identified in this research based on four dimensions of SSCM governance, supply chain learning, supply chain leadership and SSCM performance. It is argued that two new constructs of supply chain learning and supply chain leadership are an integral part of the SSCM conceptual framework developed from the literature and have significant implication to our understanding of SSCM.

TI Halal clusters
SO JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to propose a halal cluster concept to better organise production and trade of halal food.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper builds further on previous work published in the Journal of Islamic Marketing on halal food supply chains and value chains. A cluster analysis is conducted on the Malaysia and Dubai halal cluster to provide a better understanding of their halal cluster models and sustainability.
   Findings - Food production and trade has been described as the weak link in the halal value chain. To guarantee availability of and access to halal food, a new paradigm is required in better organising the production and trade of halal food through halal clusters. A halal cluster model is proposed based on five pillars, namely, Muslim consumer, education and research, halal integrity network, halal supply chain and enablers.
   Research limitations/implications - This conceptual paper proposes a halal cluster model to scale up the production of halal food for the world. However, more empirical research on halal purchasing, halal network development, halal trade and halal parks is needed to support the development of these halal clusters.
   Practical implications - To better address today's issues in the halal industries (ingredients, certification, logistics, etc.), there are evident benefits of producing in strong halal clusters, hereby providing easy access to halal ingredients and access to attractive Muslim markets.
   Originality/value - As halal is going through an evolution, towards a halal supply chain and value chain, new business models are required. It is the first study investigating halal clusters.

TI Cross-tier ripple and indirect effects of directives WEEE and RoHS on
   greening a supply chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Environmental issues have tremendous impact on the development and operations of a supply chain. However, green supply chain management is an emerging research area, thus there are limited conceptual models on this important subject, particularly models that considers the effect of environmental directives on greening a supply chain. Considering the significance of this on the performance of a supply chain, this research develops a conceptual model outlining the antecedents for a successful embeddedness of environmental directives - Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS) - on greening a supply chain. The conceptual model is theorized from systems thinking and systems theory; and grounded from an extensive current literature. It is validated using in-depth multiple cases of a supply chain of the Taiwan IT industry. Results show a close map on how the supply chain embeds directives WEEE and RoHS considering the antecedents in the conceptual model and the degree of its impact on the supply chain. It has emerged that directives WEEE and RoHS have the dynamics of a cross-tier ripple and indirect effects on the Taiwan IT industry's supply chain. This emerging theory explains why collaboration with supply chain partners is the key antecedent on greening a supply chain in order to gain co-benefits. The cross-tier ripple and indirect effects theorized from this study and the refined model provide a theoretical framework for further testing in this emerging research area.

TI Digital technologies and circular economy practices: vital enablers to
   support sustainable and resilient supply chain management in the
   post-COVID-19 era
SO TQM JOURNAL
AB Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions and revealed the fragilities in supply chains. This crisis has re-opened the debate on supply chain resilience and sustainability. This paper aims to investigate distinct impacts of COVID-19 on supply chains. It identifies both short- and medium-to-long-term measures taken to mitigate the different effects of the pandemic and highlights potential transformations and their impacts on supply chain sustainability and resilience. Design/methodology/approach To address the purpose of the study, a qualitative research approach based on case studies and semi-structured interviews with 15 practitioners from various supply chain types and sectors was conducted. Studied organizations included necessary and non-necessary supply chain sectors, which are differently impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings This study reveals five main challenges facing supply chains during COVID-19, including uncertain demand and supply, suppliers' concentration in specific regions, globalized supply chains, reduced visibility in the supply network, and limited supplier capacity. To help mitigate these challenges and develop both sustainability and resilience, this paper identifies some mitigating actions focusing on the promotion of the health and wellbeing of employees and supply chain stabilization. Further, in the post-COVID era, sustainable and resilient supply chains should consider regionalization of the supply chain, diversification of the supply network, agility, collaboration, visibility, and transparency; and should accelerate the use of smart technologies and circular economy practices as dynamic capabilities to improve supply chain resilience and sustainability. Originality/value This study contributes to exploring the sustainability- and resilience-related challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its findings can be used by researchers and supply chains decision-makers to limit disruptions and improve responsiveness, resilience, sustainability, and restoration of supply chains. The results support benchmarking through sharing of the best practices and organizations can also integrate the different capabilities discussed in this study into the processes of selection and auditing of their suppliers.

TI Two-Stage Stochastic Program for Supply Chain Network Design under
   Facility Disruptions
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB A supply chain disruption is an unanticipated event that disrupts the flow of materials in a supply chain. Any given supply chain disruption could have a significant negative impact on the entire supply chain. Supply chain network designs usually consider two stage of decision process in a business environment. The first stage deals with strategic levels, such as to determine facility locations and their capacity, while the second stage considers in a tactical level, such as production quantity, delivery routing. Each stage's decision could affect the other stage's result, and it could not be determined individual. However, supply chain network designs often fail to account for supply chain disruptions. In this paper, this paper proposed a two-stage stochastic programming model for a four-echelon global supply chain network design problem considering possible disruptions at facilities. A modified simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to determine the strategic decision at the first stage. The comparison of traditional supply chain network decision framework shows that under disruption, the stochastic solutions outperform the traditional one. This study demonstrates the managerial viability of the proposed model in designing a supply chain network in which disruptive events are proactively accounted for.

TI Comparing linear and circular supply chains: A case study from the
   construction industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB In the last decades, green and sustainable supply chain management practices have been developed in efforts to try and reduce the negative consequences of production and consumption processes on the environment. In parallel to this, the circular economy discourse has been propagated in the industrial ecology and production economics literature and, lately, in business and practice. The ideals of circular economy principles suggests that the frontiers of environmental sustainability can be pushed by emphasising the idea of transforming products in such a way that there are workable relationships between ecological systems and economic growth.
   By arguing for these ideals to be integrated into green supply chain management theory and practice, the paper uses a case study from the construction industry to demonstrate the environmental gains in terms of carbon emissions that can be achieved through some circular economy principles as against traditional linear production systems. The paper therefore asserts that an integration of circular economy principles within sustainable supply chain management can provide clear advantages from an environmental point view despite some external supply chain influences and scenarios.
   Further to this, emerging supply chain management challenges and market dynamics are also highlighted and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of creating an oligopoly through government intervention to
   improve partner collaboration intentions in the context of green supply
   chains
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Pollution from supply chains can be controlled through the high level of efficiency realized by green supply chains. However, realizing a green supply chain depends on partners' collaboration intentions. The purposes of this study are to explore the influence of oligopolies created through government intervention and how they can promote supply chain partners' collaboration intentions in the context of green supply chains. Spearman's correlation analysis, partial least squares, and the Sobel test are the main approaches adopted to evaluate the theoretical framework and hypotheses of this study. Our findings indicate that, in addition to a few leaders of the supply chain obtaining market order distribution authority, oligopolies created through government intervention guide consumers to more fully scrutinize these supply chain leaders and their partners. When their partners exhibit a lower collaboration intention in green supply chain improvement and increase the pollution emission risk, it is easy to induce and increase social pressure from consumers and thus pressure these leaders to reduce or even cancel the order distribution of these partners. To avoid order profit loss, these partners will continue to actively maintain their collaboration intentions in the green supply chain. In addition, environmental risk audits by supply chain leaders' interventions are a common approach to improve green supply chains. However, partners are usually unwilling to cooperate with leaders' audit interventions and show lower collaboration intentions. However, social pressure can threaten partners' order profits and thus drive partners to show positive collaboration intentions and further accept leaders' reasonable interventions in environmental risk audits and will have a positive effect on green supply chain improvement. Based on the above, to expedite the improvement of the green supply chain, oligopolies created through government intervention are not only an important external force but also an important national strategy in green environmental improvement.

TI Information and communication technology and the sustainability of
   microfinance
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Information and communication technology (ICT) is an important driver in the maturing microfinance industry. Microfinance providers, both non-profit microfinance institutions (MFIs) and for-profit banks, provide financial services to the poor that are critical for eradicating poverty and promoting economic development in developing nations. As the industry matures, MFIs face an increasingly competitive environment forcing them to balance the dual goals of outreach and sustainability. Interestingly, ICT may be both the instigator of this new environment and the potential solution to MFI survivability. We propose research directions on the role and impact of ICT in the microfinance industry, with special attention given to the industry's stakeholders and to the value chain of microfinancial services that are provided to the poor people in the world who need access to them. This research is at the intersection of inquiry on ICT for development and the digital divide, the impact of microfinance on poverty and development, and the use of information technology (IT) in the financial services industry. It is aimed at encouraging new research that explores important issues with respect to microfinance services to open up a dialogue and debate among interested academic researchers, microfinance institution leaders, and public policy-makers. We discuss the role and impact of ICT at the customer level, the microfinance institutional level, the donor level, and the microfinance industry level, with insights that showcase the value chain impacts and transformations that are occurring as a basis for assessing the extent to which ICT supports the sustainability of microfinance.

TI The triple-a supply chain and strategic resources: developing
   competitive advantage
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Scholars have recently begun to empirically evaluate the triple-A supply chain, which emphasizes concurrent capabilities in agility, adaptability and alignment across the supply chain to develop sustainable competitive advantage. Complexity theory suggests however that other combinations of triple-A capabilities may be equally effective, especially given a firm's strategic orientation relative to its market and its supply chain. Our research objective was to examine what combinations of these capabilities lead to the same outcome (i.e. high firm performance). Design/methodology/approach We collected 182 survey responses from a global sample of supply chain managers. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was employed to assess effective recipes of agility, adaptability, alignment, supply chain orientation, and market orientation. Findings Our results revealed four distinct "recipes" (i.e. combinations of agility, adaptability, alignment, supply chain orientation and market orientation) that lead to high levels of firm performance. Originality/value Our results indicate that firms currently do not necessarily have to concomitantly develop capabilities across all triple-A components. Considering the costs associated with developing each of these capabilities, the findings allow us to derive several theoretical and managerial insights.

AB As the market share of electric vehicles increases, the need for a charging infrastructure increases correspondingly. Modern Electric Road Systems is a cost effective charging infrastructure that allows electric vehicles to charge while driving and consequently allowing for smaller batteries in EVs. To assess the potential of electric road system technology, a demonstrator of conductive electric road developed by Elonroad has been built in Lund, Sweden. Electric measurements from the demonstrator are used in this paper to develop and validate a simulation model of the demonstrator. The aim of the simulation model is to assess power flows, losses and efficiency of different electric road system designs. In addition, the model allows for investigating the impact of electric road length, traffic load, transformer and rectifier specifications. The simulation model is validated using two different measured charging events where a modified trolley bus is charging while driving on the demonstrator. The validation results show that the simulation model has high accuracy. To further demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation model a simulation case is presented with two electric cars and one electric bus charging on an electric road. The results show that the simulation model can be used to assess losses and efficiency connected to traffic flow, vehicle types as well as additional electric road system design aspects.

Traditionally, the use of supply chain contracts has been proven to be effective in enhancing the performance of logistics systems. However, the current literature on supply chain contracts in reverse logistics is scattered. As a result, we aim to review in this paper the recent state of the art literature (2006 2016) on supply chain contracts with a focus on reverse logistics systems. We explore the popularity of different kinds of supply chain contracts, and identify the most productive researchers in the area. We classify and examine the literature with respect to the supply chain structure (i.e. the involved supply chain links), and channel leaderships (i.e. who acts as the leader). Finally, we identify the research gaps, suggest five major categories of future research directions and discuss the respective research challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Investigating green supply chain management practices and performance
   The moderating roles of supply chain ecocentricity and traceability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Sustainable supply chain management has become an increasingly important driver of business performance. Understanding the contingent nature of how performance is improved in this context is therefore a critical task for management. The purpose of this paper is to explore the moderating effects of two practices unique to sustainable supply chain - ecocentricity and supply chain traceability - on a firm's environmental and operating cost performance. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from 248 UK manufacturing firms and analyzed using moderated hierarchical regression. Findings The results suggest that green supply chain management (GSCM) practices are associated with improvements in both environmental and cost-based performance. Further, higher levels of ecocentricity and supply chain traceability are associated with stronger relationships between GSCM practices and cost performance. Contrary to expectations, high levels of supply chain traceability were found to negatively moderate the relationship between GSCM practices and environmental performance.
   Originality/value This paper offers several contributions to the research in this area. First, the authors develop and validate a measurement scale for ecocentricity and supply chain traceability. Second, the authors show how these two variables - unique to sustainable supply chains - can positively influence firm and environmental performance.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
AB This research highlights how the strength of a group of mobilized slum dwellers was harnessed to bring in change in their housing condition. The community, with active support from a non-government organization, was able to develop housing for themselves. The article demonstrates that assisted community housing as an approach is capable of offering a sustainable housing development solution in a resource-constrained country like Bangladesh. The article aims at examining the context and the process, and identifying the operational barriers, and it explores future prospect of this approach in a specific context. Through elaborating on the community efforts, the article sheds lights on the difficulties that were encountered by the NGO and the community, making this a shared struggling experience. It identifies that with a few policy-level interventions and changes in operational practices of different government agencies, a supportive environment can be created which will foster NGO's stewardship to making this approach produce more equitable, efficient, affordable and, above all, sustainable housing development for the urban poor.

AB While supply chain risk has been the subject of literally hundreds of articles, the supply chain, as envisioned by almost all of these authors is incomplete. The fact that the buying firm itself is a part of any supply chain, and the activities of the buying firm, internally, have a great impact on external supply chain risk is substantially ignored. Viewed in its entirety, there are two great concerns in supply chain management today: risk and sustainability. However, few authors have addressed these concerns collectively. That is the purpose of this paper - to demonstrate that, in a great many cases, they are intertwined. Strategies and operational plans should address this concurrence.

This research contributes to this discussion by providing new insight into exploring the role of circular economy in basic and advanced sustainable supply chain practices. The main focus of this paper is to investigate customers' points of view since it is desirable and imperative to reach their expectations. From customers' point of view, sustainability governs their health and environment resulting in persuading decision makers' sensitivity to customers' perceptions and pressures in formulating supply chain strategies. Therefore, we conducted a thematic analysis, a powerful method that strives to understand experiences and opinions on social media from August 2017 to July 2019 looking over customers' perceptions patterns. The findings reveal that environmental practices in the basic and advanced categories have the most significant attention compared to other triple bottom line dimensions by customers on social media. The findings reflect strong relation between advanced sustainable supply chain practices and circular economy. This study will conclude that mobile phone companies consider circular economy as a means to improve their advanced sustainable supply chain practices.

TI Data-driven on sustainable food supply chain: a comparison on Halal and
   non-Halal food system
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING
AB This study contributes a data-driven of sustainable food supply chain with the comparison between Halal and non-Halal food, and suggestion for future studies and practical fulfillments. Although food supply chain is urged to become sustainable, there is a lack of a systematic data-driven describing the most appropriate indicators to advance both Halal and non-Halal sustainable food supply chain. With an aim of analyzing up-to-date sustainable food supply chain, a combination of content analysis, fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is presented. The results show that the most significant indicators for non-Halal sustainable food supply chain are food consumption, food safety, food security, resilience, food waste management. The most crucial indicators of Halal sustainable food supply chain consist of Halal certification, Halal supply chain trust, Islamic values, Halal food safety. A contemporary sustainable food supply chain is presented and future trends, challenges, and opportunities are determined.

AB This paper describes the first phase of the authors' Design for Supply Chain research that seeks to address supply chain excellence the product design process. In a global economy, companies must address supply chain issues beyond the traditional viewpoint of logistics, trucking, warehousing and include other considerations that affects design and manufacturing decisions. To include supply chain perspectives in the design of products and manufacturing processes, supply chain performance data play a critical role. This paper examines the source of data pertinent to design for supply chain using methods such as Customer Value Chain Analysis and Quality Function Deployment. A multi-industry benchmarking study also highlights the different approaches to Design for Supply Chain and emerging challenges of Social and Environmentally Responsible Supply Chains. The study revealed that lead time, quality and social/environmental metrics are the most important metrics for design for supply chain. Future research will address the refinement of metrics, the definition of the relevant data for product design, and effective approaches to incorporate the information into the product definition process.

TI The Two Million Housing Drive in Korea A supply solution for affordable
   housing in the developing world
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB Purpose Emerging states confront staggering shortages in adequate housing stock. In response, governments have sought various supply-based solutions to mitigate growing housing deficits. While many of these mass housing efforts have not produced the desired outcome, the Republic of Korea's Two Million Housing Drive (TMHD) was a comparatively successful intervention with its implementation from 1988 to 1992. The five-year initiative exceeded its objective with the construction of over 2.1 million units - of which two-thirds were built by the private sector. The purpose of this study is to analyse Korea's relatively effective supply-based affordable housing approach and then extrapolate best practices and lessons learned with applications for real estate markets in the developing world. Comparative understanding of the TMHD can help promote greater access to adequate housing in the developing world, especially for the many who continue to live in impoverished conditions. Design/methodology/approach The research uses content-based and quantitative methods to analyze the case of the TMHD in Korea toward informing improvements in corresponding supply-based housing policies and programs in developing states. Findings While there were challenges with the TMHD, the program repositioned Korea's urban housing market with greater access to affordable housing in cities for the lower-income and vulnerable. The TMHD enabled the subsequent effectiveness of demand-based housing policies.
   Social implications Deeper understanding of the TMHD can lead to reforms of other mass housing initiatives in emerging markets to make adequate housing more accessible and economical for the benefit of underserved segments of society. Originality/value The Korean experience with the TMHD can inform the optimization of other similar large-scale policies and programs seeking to sustainably overcome shortfalls in adequate housing that have become all too common in the developing world.

TI Big data-Industry 4.0 readiness factors for sustainable supply chain
   management: Towards circularity
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Big data-Industry 4.0 interaction is expected to revolutionize the existing supply chains in recent years. While increased operational efficiency and enhanced decision-making are the primary advantages studied widely, the sustainable aspects of digital supply chain in the circular economy era have received limited attention. The previous literature rarely explores the industry readiness for a digital supply chain. Thus, the present study objectives to explore Big data-Industry 4.0 readiness factors for sustainable supply chain management. A detailed literature analysis was performed to identify a total of seventeen readiness factors for sustainable supply chain management. A team of six experts were consulted to perform the pairwise comparison for the identified po-tential readiness factors. This study adopts a fuzzy best-worst method to prioritize the readiness factors according to their degree of influence. The results from the study reflect that "readiness towards information system infrastructure", "Internet stability for developing I4.0 infrastructure", and "circular process and awareness" are the most significant readiness factors. The potential recommendation of this study includes the increased attention from sustainable supply chain stakeholders on developing infrastructure, including knowledge building exercise and training process focused on circular economy process. The findings from the study will assist sus-tainable supply chain stakeholders to frame strategies and action plans during the digitalization of supply chains.

TI Influence of Supply Chain Collaborative Innovation on Sustainable
   Development of Supply Chain: A Study on Chinese Enterprises
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The recent trade friction between the two largest economies, US and China, is having a profound impact on the sustainable development of supply chains at a global scale. Supply chain collaborative innovation has not only become the main means for enterprises in various countries to cope with imponderable changes, but also been the driver of increasing supply chain dynamic capability and of achieving sustainable development of supply chains. Based on the survey data of 510 Chinese enterprises, this paper adopts the hierarchical regression analysis and a structural equation model to study the impact of supply chain collaborative innovation on the sustainable development of supply chains. The results show that: (1) Three modes of supply chain collaborative innovation (namely, technology collaborative innovation, management collaborative innovation, and market collaborative innovation) have different effects on supply chain dynamic capability and sustainable supply chain performance. (2) Supply chain dynamic capability plays a significant intermediary role between supply chain collaborative innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. (3) Supply chain technology collaborative innovation has the greatest direct impact on sustainable supply chain performance, followed by supply chain management collaborative innovation. However, the direct effect of supply chain market collaborative innovation on sustainable supply chain performance is not significant; under the intermediary role of dynamic capability, supply chain market collaborative innovation has a significant indirect effect on sustainable supply chain performance.

AB The purpose of this study is to analyse a potential design for sustainable houses which applies Computer Aided Design (CAD). There are two popular CAD software packages manufactured by Autodesk Inc., which are AutoCAD and 3d Studio. AutoCAD is used for drafting purposes while 3d Studio is used to generate 3D images and animation movies. The application of CAD enables both the architect and clients who are committee members assigned by the State Economic Planning Unit (UPEN), a representative body for the State Government of Penang, Malaysia to view the proposed housing model as if it is real and already built on the site. The most interesting part of this study is that CAD becomes a tool to generate affordable housing models. The government goal is to use these models as an example of successful development in resettlement programmes for fishing villages in Malaysia.

TI Sustainable supply chain management in emerging economies: Environmental
   turbulence, institutional voids and sustainability trajectories
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Although research on supply chain management has made many valuable contributions, there is a dearth of empirical evidence and theoretical reflection on the characteristics of supply chains that operate mainly in developing and emerging economies. The aim of this paper is to help to fill this gap by exploring how supply chain sustainability can be implemented and managed in these settings. An in-depth case study of the upstream oil and gas industry supply chain in Brazil was used to develop propositions about supply chains that operate in developing settings. Drawing from institutional theory, evolutionary theory, complexity theory, and from the organizational learning, innovation, and strategy literatures, this paper offers four key findings and contributions to the supply chain literature. First, it shows that becoming a sustainable supply chain is not a destination, but a journey, where trajectory and time matter. Given the evolutionary nature of supply chain sustainability trajectories, this paper highlights that supply chains learn and evolve just as organizations do. Second, this research indicates that, although globalization is a trend, natural resource-based supply chains are often more geographically bounded and susceptible to local social demands than other supply chains. Third, this paper extends the supply chain literature by arguing that supply chains face additional barriers to sustainability in developing and emerging economies, which contribute to a higher degree of complexity and uncertainty due to the existence of highly turbulent business environments and institutional voids. These factors in turn hinder supply chain learning and innovation, and reduce the slope of supply chains sustainability trajectories. Finally, this research contributes to the literature by claiming that, due to the highly complex and uncertain business environments, in these settings focal companies play an even more important role in managing the escalating ambiguity, stimulating supply chain learning, and promoting innovation towards supply chains enhanced sustainability performance.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB A prevention framework represents one of the fundamental means of the Australian Government's contemporary drive to achieve permanent reductions in homelessness. Consistent with prevailing policies in the UK and US, Australia has approached homelessness prevention through identification and early intervention of individuals at risk of homelessness. In this article we suggest that prevention strategies focused on the risk factors that individual pose obscures efforts to address the underlying structural factors that contribute to homelessness, or to reduce the prevalence of homelessness at the overall population level. The article examines the efficacy of increasing the supply of affordable housing to prevent homelessness, but suggests that the provision of housing alone may be insufficient to realising related well-being objectives. In turn, it is proposed that policy which focuses on poverty reduction has the capacity to achieve the sustainable prevention of homelessness ambitions.

SO INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT FOR HIGHLY ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOUSING:
   OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF PASSIVE HOUSES
SE Sustainable Urban Areas
AB The adoption of innovative concepts - such as that of the passive house - can be effective in restricting the demand for space heating in houses. This has been shown in demonstration projects introducing various innovations that significantly reduce the energy use of houses.
   This study examines the innovations that can be expected when promoting the passive house concept, splitting it into easily recognisable principles and specific technological criteria. Data were collected from residential demonstration projects, using company interviews, in order to examine the innovations introduced in passive house demonstration projects in the Flemish Region (northern Belgium). The study thus provides a technological review of product, system, service and architectural innovations as they actually appear in new-built passive houses and renovations.
   In the analysis, insights from companies are used to examine the opportunities for and barriers to the introduction of passive house innovations, as well as solutions to some of the barriers.
   The present work shows how energy-efficiency targets have been translated into various technological opportunities resulting from the specific requirements of passive houses and related technologies. Many innovations can be expected to emerge from the promotion of passive houses. In addition to those of a technological nature, these innovations are likely to involve systems, services and architecture. The introduction of innovations related to passive houses can be hindered by lack of demand or market infrastructure. The findings of this study nevertheless show that change agents could facilitate the adoption of innovation by clients, as well as by enterprises.

AB With the advent of globalization, and the corresponding decrease in the number of barriers to international commerce, trade in the food industry spanned national and international boundaries. This phenomenal development has resulted in a plethora of food related contamination scandals. With the increasing complexity within the supply chain networks, it is imperative that all actors within the food supply chain operate in an ethical and sustainable manner and this paper illustrates a process model that will effectively bolster the ethical underpinning of a fresh produce supply chain. This paper evinces a structural conceptual model that facilitates the integration of responsibility within the operations of the organizations, within a fruit and vegetable supply chain. It also conceptualises a seven-tiered sequential model, the Vision to Innovation model (The V2I model) of responsibility, which has its foundation based on the congruence of the ethics related values, and Values consonance along its supply chain actors. The second element involves Communication among the supply chain elements; the successive elements include Implementation of ethical standards along the supply chain, the Monitoring systems, Control systems, Collaboration and finally, Innovation. This model accounts for responsibility-centricity along the entire supply chain and the implementation of this model, within the practical business world, would render an ethical climate for the industry. The authors postulate that this will positively influence the T's of fresh produce supply chains, namely: Traceability, Testability, Transparency, Trust and Time. Currently minimal research on social responsibility and sustainability within the supply chain context is present and this paper contributes to such a gap in literature.

AB Purpose Big data analytics capabilities are the driving force and deemed as an operational excellence approach to improving the green supply chain performance in the post COVID-19 situation. Motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic and the problems it poses to the supply chain's long-term viability, this study used dynamic capabilities theory as a foundation to assess the imperative role of big data analytics capabilities (management, talent and technological) toward green supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach This study was quantitative and cross-sectional. Data were collected from 374 executives through a survey questionnaire method by applying an appropriate random sampling technique. The authors employed PLS-SEM to analyze the data. Findings The findings revealed that big data analytics capabilities play a significant role in boosting up sustainable supply chain performance. It was found that big data analytics capabilities significantly contributed to supply chain risk management and innovative green product development that ultimately enhanced innovation and learning performance. Moreover, innovation and green learning performance has a significant and positive relationship with sustainable supply chain performance. In the post COVID-19 situation, organizations can enhance their sustainable supply chain performance by giving extra attention to big data analytics capabilities and supply chain risk and innovativeness. Originality/value The paper specifically emphasizes on the factors that result in the sustainability in supply chain integrated with the big data analytics. Additionally, it offers the boundary condition for gaining the sustainable supply chain management.

AB Reduction of waste in food supply chains is an important sustainability issue. More efficient utilisation and management of the resources and values created in food supply chains can contribute to improving competitiveness, and environmental and social responsibility. This study uses the seven wastes approach from lean theory to classify categories of waste in fresh food supply chains and to identify at which stage of the supply chain waste occur. A case is used to illustrate the applicability of the classification. The analysis identifies four categories of waste in the fresh food supply chain; time, distance, energy and mass. The study indicates that the majority of waste is hidden in time, energy and mass categories, related to overproduction, defects and transportation.

TI Using ICT to Overcome Constraints in the Agriculture Value Chain:
   Emerging Trends in Ghana
SO E-AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT: GLOBAL INNOVATIONS AND FUTURE
   PROSPECTS
AB Development partner efforts and private sector initiatives on ICT applications in agriculture have brought new opportunities for farmers and traders to reduce transaction costs and increase incomes. The applications are primarily used for linking actors in the agricultural value chain, accessing real time information on prices, buyers and sellers, transport and haulage, and other relevant information services in the agricultural value chain. Limited evidence from Ghana and elsewhere show that cell phone applications have resulted in increased incomes but the impacts and sustainability of other ICT applications have proven elusive. The role of ICT in overcoming the key constraints in the agricultural value chain and for making evidence-based decisions will be greatly enhanced if farmers, aggregators, and other stakeholders in the value chain pay attention to their business scope and schedule planning, executing, monitoring and control, procurement, risk planning, and stakeholder communications in a "project management" context. When this is done, ICT applications will facilitate supply chain management through sharing of timely and pertinent information on producers, buyers and other services, thereby helping to promote industry competitiveness. The major challenges to the widespread use and sustainability of ICT remain access to the appropriate ICT tool, poor road and storage infrastructure (particularly in the farming communities) and illiteracy on the part of the majority of smallholder farmers.

TI Whole-building Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a passive house of the
   sub-tropical climatic zone
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The Passive House concept requires the incorporation of a combination of energy-efficient solutions, which despite their benefits they also burden the environmental performance of the passive house construction with additional resource depletion and energy consumption. The aim of this work is to implement a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a passive house located in an island state, having an insular energy system, within the sub-tropical climatic zone. For the implementation of the life-cycle study, the building environmental assessment tool EcoHestia was employed. Under this context, the environmental performance of the passive house was established and presented on (a) a construction material breakdown basis and (b) a building element breakdown basis. Additionally, the optimization of the passive house design was defined through a parameterization analysis of its embodied energy and primary energy demand. The findings of this work indicated that cortcrete (C20-C25) is the greatest contributor across all environmental impact categories, except in the abiotic depletion of elements category, where tiles were found to be responsible for more than the 65% of the total impact. The analysis also indicated that the foundations and floors and the wall systems are contributing considerably to the environmental performance of the passive house. Additionally, a parametric analysis indicated that employing insulating materials in the building's wall systems can have a beneficial effect in the energy efficiency of a building, without burdening substantially its total embodied energy.

TI Digital Supply Chain Capabilities: Mitigating Disruptions and Leveraging
   Competitive Advantage Under COVID-19
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Researchers and practitioners have highlighted the importance of supply chain analytic capabilities in managing risk while maintaining a competitive advantage (COA). However, the importance of digital supply chain capabilities (DSCCs) in improving resilience, agility, and robustness practices to foster the implementation of sustainable supply chain practices and any resulting COA remains unclear. Based on the dynamic capabilities view, we propose a research model for achieving a COA in contexts of uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of Indian small and medium-sized enterprises in the original equipment manufacturing industry, comprising 310 respondents, was administered. Using structural equation modeling, we examine the proposed model. The findings show a significant positive effect of DSCCs on supply chain resilience and agile practices. The findings also indicate that supply chain resilience, robustness, and agile practices positively affect sustainable supply chain practices. Moreover, sustainable supply chain practices positively influence COA. Furthermore, the study reveals that the effect of DSCCs on sustainable supply chain practices is mediated by supply chain resilience, robustness, and agile practices. Managers concerned with investment in sustainable supply chain practices can obtain a COA through the successful implementation of supply chain resilience, robustness, and agile practices.

TI Research on the applicability of passive house technology in areas hot
   in summer and cold in winter-take Nanjing area as the research object
SO AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB In this study, to explore the applicability of passive house technology under PHPP assessment standards in Chinese areas hot in summer and cold in winter, Nanjing area was taken as an example, real cases were examines under PHPP assessment standards for passive houses in line with regional climatic differences. The present study focused on four aspects, namely the thermal insulation & heat preservation properties of the external enclosure structure, the mildew-growing temperature of the interior wall, the air-tightness property of the external enclosure structure, as well as the damp-proof performance of buildings. A numeric analysis was conducted using Dest software, and the German PHPP assessment standards for passive houses were eventually found not entirely applicable to Chinese areas hot in summer and hot in winter. Thermal insulation, damp-proof, and vapor-proof properties should be considered when designing passive house projects for such areas. Based on influential factors, this study proposed the climatically-reconstructed design for the external enclosure structure of passive houses and employed Energyplus for demonstration and analysis. Analytical findings suggested that the reconstruction plan is feasible.

TI An Empirical Examination of Sustainable Supply Chain Risk and
   Integration Practices: A Performance-Based Evidence from Pakistan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In today's emerging environment sustainable supply chain risks play a vital role in firms' performance more than ever, because risks tend to disrupt sustainable operations, which ultimately reduces a firm's performance, but these risks can be managed through supply chain integration practices, which leads to higher firms' performance. Therefore, this paper examines the relationship between sustainable supply chain risks, supply chain integration, and firm's financial performance. This study employs 296 survey observations along with financial data of published annual statements to estimate the quantitative causal-effects of three dimensions of sustainable supply chain risks on supply chain integration and financial performance. The findings of the study suggest that sustainable internal business process risks, sustainable supply risks, and sustainable demand risks have a negative relationship with supply chain integration. Furthermore, results of the study explored that all the three supply chain integration practices have a positive impact on firms' financial performance, which suggests that implementing supply chain integration practices reduces the effect of supply chain risks and increases the firm's performance.

TI Sustainable Triple-A Supply Chains
SO PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB In his 2004 article, Professor Hau Lee argues that the best supply chains are not only fast and cost-effective but also agile, adaptable, and aligned. The concept of triple-A supply chains has been extensively studied in academic and trade publications and integrated into numerous operations and supply chain management curricula. It has also influenced the management approach of leaders around the world. Yet since the triple-A concept was first developed, supply chains have become increasingly global, connected, and interdependent. The increased complexity of global supply chains has reduced much-needed visibility, further complicating their management, while the growing connectivity and interdependence among different stakeholders have led to many unforeseen environmental and social issues. As a result, Professor Lee's emphasis on triple-A supply chains is even more relevant today. In light of these new challenges and demands, we revisit the original triple-A definitions of agile, adaptable, and aligned, expanding these concepts for a more socially and environmentally conscientious world. We also discuss potential enablers of and barriers to sustainable triple-A supply chains.

AB This article examines corporate responsibility in the supply chains of four of the largest Scandinavian multinational corporations - IKEA, Nokia, Novo Nordisk, and StatoilHydro - and offers two key findings. First, these Scandinavian companies have all implemented responsible supply chain practices where suppliers in developing nations, and the communities of these suppliers, are engaged as key stakeholders and treated as partners. Second, these supply chain practices all share the common bond of having honesty and the establishment of trust-based relationships at their foundation. As a result, these Scandinavian companies have developed a "cooperative advantage" in their ability to form successful, long-term partnerships in their respective supply chains.

TI Feasibility Study of Affordable Earth Masonry Housing in the U.S. Gulf
   Coast Region
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING
AB Compressed and stabilized earth block (CSEB) structural systems represent a sustainable low-cost alternative to other construction systems that are common in industrialized countries. The wide availability of suitable soils makes these structural systems attractive for building affordable housing worldwide. Currently, CSEB construction in the USA is mainly used in dry and arid regions and has rarely been used in humid climates. In this work, a structural, architectural, and economic feasibility study for CSEB structural systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast region is presented. The structural feasibility study presented in this paper included the identification of locally available soils for CSEB fabrication; experimental investigation of mechanical properties of CSEB and mortar as function of their composition; durability study for a CSEB wall with and without protective plastering; and calculation of wind resistance for a representative CSEB house. The architectural feasibility study investigated the use of CSEB systems in vernacular housing typologies of Southern Louisiana. Finally, the economic feasibility study compared the cost of a reference house built using CSEBs and other more common construction materials. The results obtained in this study suggest that CSEB systems have the potential to provide a modern, cost-effective, sustainable, hurricane-resistant housing construction system as an alternative to more common constructions systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.

TI Occupant Experience of Everyday Life in Some of the First Passive Houses
   in Denmark
SO HOUSING THEORY & SOCIETY
AB In future years the building industry will face great challenges in fulfilling stricter energy demands. One way to meet requirements is to build passive houses. In Germany passive houses have been constructed for many years but in Denmark the building industry has just begun. The pilot project, named Comfort Houses, aims to show the industry that it is possible to construct traditional Danish houses as passive houses and promote them as comfortable houses. For this to be a success in the future, it is necessary to fulfil the occupants' needs and wishes. This study aims to communicate how the occupants of the Comfort Houses experience living in a passive house and if their lives and everyday practices have changed after moving in. This is done through interviews with the occupants about their everyday life both in their previous home and in the Comfort House. The results show that the occupants' everyday lives have changed - some as a result of the architectural and structural solutions, others as a result of the technology integrated in the houses.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB While the potential benefits of integrating digital technologies and supply chain management have been widely reported, less is known concerning the current state-of-the-art literature on big data-driven sustainable supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to systematise published studies which address the implications of big data for sustainable supply chain management. Through a systematic literature review, this work makes three significant contributions: (a) it provides an overview of extant literature on this topic in recent years; (b) it proposes seven gaps in the literature in order to foster future investigations on big data-driven sustainable supply chains; (c) it offers four lessons for business practitioners aiming to use big data for sustainable supply chain practices. These lessons suggest that: developing big data analytics capability has to become a business priority in order to effectively build competitive sustainable supply chains; big data has benefits for each of the dimensions of the triple-bottom-line in supply chains; the implementation of big data for sustainability in supply chains presents some challenges for firms; the development of complementary organizational capabilities is needed to overcome challenges and facilitate the benefits of big data technology for sustainable supply chain management.

TI Developing a model for an agile supply chain in pharmaceutical industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop a model for an agile supply chain in the pharmaceutical industry. In a continuous changing global competitive environment, an organization's supply chain agility directly impacts its ability to produce and deliver novel products to its customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. While the beneficial effect of supply chain agility is generally appreciated, the literature addressing how a pharmaceutical company can achieve supply chain agility is limited.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyzes the three parts of pharmaceutical supply chain including supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient, manufacturing and distribution based on the supply chain operations reference model to assess agile supply chains by using three diverse questionnaires. In addition, to prioritize critical factors, TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) algorithm as a common technique of multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) model has been used.
   Findings - Achieving supply chain agility is dependent on other capabilities; including flexibility, responsibility, competency and quickness. Findings reveal several factors identified as critical factors to being agile in each part of pharmaceutical supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications - This research was challenged with some limitations such as novelty of the subject in this environment, and the lake of data in this area is also another constraint.
   Originality/value - This is an initial and pioneering study to highlight the importance of agility concept in the pharmaceutical industry. The present study also provides a new aspect of supply chain management for such industry, and would be a good topic for further research. Finally, this study contributes to highlight and prioritize factors involved in this area.

TI Supply chain sustainability trajectories: learning through
   sustainability initiatives
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper explores how organizational capabilities and path dependence affect the implementation of supply chain (SC) sustainability initiatives. Through the lenses of contingency and evolutionary theory, the paper addresses the underexplored supply chain dynamics that enhance or inhibit sustainability trajectories. Design/methodology/approach Using in-depth multi-case studies for theory elaboration, five supply chains were studied through open-ended interviews with SC members, secondary data collection and site visit observation. The design consists of a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to elaborate theory on supply chain dynamics and enhanced sustainability trajectories. Findings The empirical study shows that learning is a fundamental condition for supply chains as they implement sustainability initiatives, and that exploitation capabilities are more frequently used than exploration capabilities. Path dependence plays a role in the outcomes of supply chain sustainability initiatives, which are influenced by both path dependence and contingencies of the contexts in which these systems operate. Research limitations/implications This paper puts forward five propositions that emerge from the literature and from the field study results. Although this is an exploratory research bounded by geographical limitations and the limited number of SC cases, the goal of elaborating theory may open up several promising avenues for future large-scale and longitudinal research studies. Practical implications By enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of supply chain sustainability trajectories, decision-makers, scholars and policy-makers can better understand how supply chains learn, how they employ SC member capabilities and how they deal with stakeholder resistance. Originality/value This paper extends supply chain sustainability theory by addressing the knowledge gap that exists with regard to understanding the dynamics of evolving supply chain sustainability trajectories. This paper sheds additional light on this important topic and contributes in multiple ways to the sustainable supply chain management literature.

But rather than seeing them as disruptive and challenging, THOW could be a solution we've all been searching for to the wicked problem of affordable housing. In recent decades, the tiny house movement has flourished in Europe and America, with an industry of builders, designers, real estate agents and property owners tapping into the tiny economy. The establishment of Australian companies specialising in THOW shows there is a need for planning to catch up with market demand as houses are being constructed, yet certainty of obtaining approval varies considerably between local governments. A combination of planning, building and transport regulations are the largest barriers restricting the growth of THOW as an acceptable housing form in Australia. If tenancy of THOW can be legitimised through planning or building approvals, then regulatory red tape and various economic barriers such as the ability to obtain financing and insurance for THOW may be ameliorated.

TI Wildlife trafficking as a societal supply chain risk: Removing the
   parasite without damaging the host?
SO JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Humanity's intrusion into nature-with the objective of selling animals and plants as medicine, food, and tourist attractions-is detrimental not only to biodiversity and the health of ecosystems but also to local communities, global society, and human health. Often, traffickers exploit legal supply chains to secretly move endangered species and protected wildlife to end consumers. Serendipitous discoveries of wildlife trafficking attempts raise concerns that existing efforts to prevent wildlife trafficking and other criminal exploitation of legal supply chains brought about by international laws, regulations, and voluntary initiatives may often fail. Indeed, most supply chains are designed for economic purposes such as efficiency or responsiveness rather than security. Scholarship in supply chain management has thus far dedicated scarce attention to the overarching phenomenon of illegal exploitation of otherwise legal supply chains, referred to as "supply chain infiltration." Because we were unable to speak with perpetrators directly, we obtained insights from expert stakeholders in order to study the delicate and covert topic of what makes supply chains vulnerable to wildlife trafficking, as well as how this vulnerability can be mitigated. Our data set comprises 37 semi-structured interviews with knowledgeable stakeholders concerning wildlife trafficking, specifically in maritime supply chains. This research develops a model that explains supply-chain-related vulnerabilities to wildlife trafficking and elaborates regarding how respective actors can contribute in addressing this understudied issue. We introduce the concept of "societal supply chain risk" to refer to hazards that emanate from or materialize within supply chains, which primarily affect actors in the supply chain context-and possibly even humanity in its entirety. Our research calls for more supply chain research, exploring situations in which individual firms may not be affected but can contribute to the solution.

TI The role of the focal company in sustainable development goals: A
   Brazilian food poultry supply chain case study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Food supply chains face challenges of sustainable supply chain management, such as waste management and environmental issues. Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question "how to be sustainable?", especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums.

TI Review of Strategic Agility: A Holistic Framework for Fresh Produce
   Supply Chain Disruptions
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The influence of the rapidly changing business environment due to the COVID-19 global pandemic presents an important organizational challenge to fresh produce export supply chains in developing countries such as Ghana. Such an inimical supply chain problem highlights the relevance of supply chain agility as a potent methodological framework to measure, monitor and evaluate these challenges in stable as well as turbulent times. This review paper focuses on the applicability of a framework for Supply Chain Agility as a methodological framework in stable (pre-COVID-19) versus turbulent (COVID-19) business environments. We argue and propose that Supply Chain Agility Framework is a holistic framework which is efficacious in both stable and unstable supply chain environments. This is amply supported by the central plank of our proposition that the Supply Chain Agility Framework offers an adaptable tool that can serve as a panacea to fresh produce supply chain challenges not only in a stable (pre-COVID-19) business environment but also effective and applicable in a turbulent business environment, such as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of this proposition for the fresh produce export supply chain industry and relevant stakeholders are duly presented.

TI Sandbag housing construction in South Africa: life cycle assessment and
   operational energy modelling
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB PurposeAdequate and affordable housing is essential in tackling poverty and improving living and indoor health conditions for lower and medium-income families, in both developed and developing nations. However, there is a lack of affordable housing which directly causes homelessness and formation of slum-dwellings. Sub-Saharan Africa has the most urban slum dwellers with an estimated 53.6% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa dwelling in urban slums. Additionally, the housing deficit in South Africa currently stands at about 2.2 million units, with a projected housing demand of 500,000 housing units over 20 years. Given the climate crisis and need for affordable housing in South Africa, low-cost and low-carbon solutions are essential. Sandbag building technology (SBT) is one such promising solution, consuming less energy during construction and operation than conventional technologies as well as regulating the internal temperature of the building through thermal mass. However, there is still a need to assess how this simpler construction style and locally sourced building materials perform from a whole life cycle perspective. Thus, this paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) determining the holistic sustainability of a vernacular, sandbag house design in South Africa.MethodsThe environmental LCA analysed the SBT under two scenarios: manual and automated, based on extraction of sand. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis evaluated the SBT house from the different life cycle stages: design, production and operation, and disposal. The findings show that the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions depend largely on the availability of locally sourced sand and whether the process is manual, automated, or both.ResultsUpfront embodied CO(2)e emissions total 189 and 174 kgCO(2)e/m(2) for the automated and manual scenarios, respectively. Assuming no decarbonisation, the operational emissions equal 7966 kgCO(2)e/m(2), but could be as low as 1444 kgCO(2)e/m(2) (achieving net zero by 2050). Whole life embodied CO(2)e impacts, i.e. stages A and C, total 262 and 247 kgCO(2)e/m(2) for the automated and manual scenarios, respectively. The difference between the manual and automated scenarios can be significant at 15 kgCO(2)e/m(2), equating to an additional 1125 kgCO(2)e for a 75m(2) house. The estimated LCC for a 75 m(2) building constructed with SBT is R 533,898.01 (US $31,167) or R 7118/m(2).ConclusionsThe sandbag method remains challenging for multi-storey construction due to the weight; however, it can contribute to low carbon, affordable housing in South Africa as a sandbag house does not need highly skilled labour or expensive materials.

TI A review of robotics and autonomous systems in the food industry: From
   the supply chains perspective
SO TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Background.
   An increasing global population means resource utilisation and food security remain the critical global challenges. Robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) have been applied to improve productivity, and their role in enhancing supply chain operations is explored here.
   Scope and approach.
   Researchers have studied ways to adopt and integrate RAS into the food industry. However, most of the current literature focuses on the technological impact of RAS. In contrast, this paper discusses the adoption of RAS in the food industry from the supply chain perspective with regard to the supply chain operations.
   Key findings and conclusions.
   The study has selected 54 papers using a nine-step systematic review process. This research analysed the use of RAS across five major themes of the food supply chain, including food quality, food safety, food waste, supply chain efficiency, and supply chain analysis. The role of RAS the data availability, cybersecurity, skill capability, and financial costs are discussed in the context of adopting RAS in food supply chains. Future research directions are proposed with the aim of enhancing the application of RAS in food supply chain operations.

TI Indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in global supply
   chains: Pathway to a social supply chain management framework
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Even though global supply chains are (usually unintentionally) tied to slave labor, research and practice have largely ignored the issue. This is expected to change as civil society activism and new legislation increase the risk of litigation and reputational damage to supply chain partners. To deal with and combat modern slavery in the supply chain, a theory inspired social supply chain management framework consisting of indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in the supply chain is developed. The framework is refined in a qualitative expert interview study. The theoretical framework is then evaluated by a multimethod empirical analysis that includes a multicase study based on publicly available supply chain data from 6000 media articles and company websites as well as a quantitative empirical study based on survey data from 280 corporate sustainability experts operating in global supply networks. The results show that economic, political-legal, social, and environmental factors have a significant impact on contemporary slavery in the supply chain. The study also motivates supply chain partners to use preventative and detective measures to reduce the probability of encountering modern slavery actions in their supply chain. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn from the findings, pointing to a holistic approach to combatting modern slavery in the supply chain.

TI The antecedents of supply chain agility and their effect on business
   performance: an organizational strategy perspective
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB In a rapidly changing business environment, supply chain agility has been recognized as an important source of sustainable competitive advantage. A large number of studies have explored the antecedents of supply chain agility, but there is little analysis from a strategic perspective. Taking into account the guiding role of strategic orientation in business development, we want to establish a link between strategic orientation and supply chain agility. Therefore, this paper chooses two strategic orientation, namely learning orientation and technology orientation, as two antecedents and test their effect on supply chain agility and also test whether supply chain agility has a mediating effect on the relationship between the two antecedents and business performance. Survey data were collected from 208 Chinese manufacturing enterprises and the structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the proposed hypotheses in the research model. The results show that the two antecedents have a positive effect on supply chain agility and supply chain agility can improve business performance. It also shows that both learning orientation and technology orientation can indirectly promote business performance through the mediating effect of supply chain agility.

TI Minimizing Waste in the Food Supply Chain: Role of Information System,
   Supply Chain Strategy, and Network Design
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB A continuous increase in the world population and reduction in quantity and quality of resources is putting enormous pressure on nations to ensure a balance between food demand and supply. The same is highlighted at number two in the United Nations' sustainable development goals as the Zero Hunger goal. However, a significant portion of produced food worldwide is damaged or wasted in the food supply chain. This study focuses on minimizing waste in the food supply chain by highlighting the importance of strategy, information systems, and network design in the food supply chain. The authors collected data from 211 respondents from 48 firms and analyzed it through structural equation modeling. It has been found that information system has great potential to minimize waste in the food supply chain. Moreover, strategy and network design significantly improve organizational capabilities to minimize waste in the food supply chain. The finding provides constructive insights to food companies to incorporate and operationalize recommended measures to minimize waste in the food supply chain so that the world can counter the food shortage and waste/damage problem and the Zero Hunger goal can successfully be achieved.

TI Implications of Additive Manufacturing on Supply Chain Management
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INTEGRATION AND MANAGEMENT-INNOVATION AND
   ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Additive manufacturing is emerging as one of the manufacturing technologies, which affect the traditional supply chain management. The traditional supply chain is based on a push system, whereas an additional supply chain is based on a pull system. In this work we have found the impact of 3D printing on supply chain management, what the risks and opportunities of 3D printing on the supply chain are and, also what the companies are doing to leverages these opportunities and risks. It has been concluded that the additive supply chain has drastically changed the traditional supply chain in four key ways i.e. time, quality, speed, and environmental impact. It will result in the effective management of resources, which is of immense importance, keeping in mind the sustainable development goals of a blue-chip organization. It will be cost-effective and will reduce the lead-time of the supply chain. It will result in increased customer satisfaction, as the product will be produced by mass customization and improved quality. Moreover, this will lead to flexibility in the manufacturing process, which will enhance industrial efficiency. Therefore, we can say that this research will give us the vision of different industries in India in the coming years.

AB Machine-learning technologies are key enablers to enhance the circularity in smart supply chain distributions. The digital and sustainable supply chain is a tangible representation of circular economy future growth that takes environmental challenges, by reducing materials consumption for manufacturing and reducing transportation emissions. Yet, machine learning, circular economy and digital supply chain are novel disciplines. There is limited research to fully acknowledge the promise of circular approaches in the context for waste treatment and transportation. To fill in this gap, this study investigate the integration of circularity using machine-learning techniques for waste treatment supply chain Resulting in a circular economy framework that integrate several tools and concepts, which will assists manufacturers in implementing circular solutions for waste and leachate treatment and transportation. The aim of the study is to present the idea of the approachal application of the opportunities offered by digital technologies and the circularity for waste processing organizations in term of their smart supply chain management. The proposed framework may be handy for practitioners to develop coordinating operations throughout waste treatment supply chain, with the circular economy concepts and digital technology opportunities.

TI Building reliable supply chains for noncommunicable disease commodities:
   lessons learned from HIV and evidence needs
SO AIDS
AB Objective: Successful noncommunicable disease (NCD) management requires a reliable supply chain. The objectives of this article are to examine lessons learned from HIV supply chain initiatives, describe opportunities to advance supply chain systems for NCD health commodities based on HIV supply chain successes and identify areas where additional research is still needed for reliable NCD supply chains in LMICs.
   Design: We describe practical experiences gained from developing HIV supply chain systems and how those lessons can be used to inform NCD supply chain systems.
   Methods: Supply chain challenges with HIV commodities in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are identified and categorized using literature review and expert experiences. Solutions are described on the basis of lessons learned from global HIV initiatives. Opportunities to further advance NCD supply chain systems are recommended.
   Results: Supply chain challenges can be organized into two groups: 1) resource mobilization and 2) resource utilization. Global HIV initiatives have responded to resource mobilization challenges by increasing availability of funding, filling human resource gaps, improving essential storage and creating better transport mechanisms and information technology infrastructure. These initiatives have assisted in better resource utilization by strengthening procurement processes, standardizing and simplifying supply chain systems, reducing integrity and security vulnerabilities and harnessing the power of better data. Advances achieved through HIV initiatives are readily transferrable to NCD supply chains with minimal additional investment. Research opportunities exist to identify the most efficient and cost-effective ways to develop more reliable supply chains for NCDs. Copyright (C) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

SO GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Supply chains are complex systems, and the decision making and support processes for the development and management of such multifaceted entities are quite challenging. In order to become sustainable, supply chains are well advised to improve their business processes continuously and strive for strategic as well as functional alignment between their member organizations. Current supply chain practices are often ad hoc and lack end-to-end support for the gradual transformation towards supply chain sustainability. This article specifies high-level decision-making stages of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and proposes a multi-layered SSCM maturity model. This proposed model leverages a roadmap for sustainable business transformation and is further developed using a sustainability modelling and reporting (SMART) system.

AB Developing nations such as India are facing a major socio-economic challenge of addressing the growing housing shortage. The shortage mainly implies to the low-income groups who reside in congested and inappropriate habitats due to unavailability of affordable shelters. To ensure socially inclusive development, making affordable and adequate housing accessible to all has been the motto of the developing economies. However, promoting massive housing construction programs could create a significant burden on natural resources, energy, water, and land and leads to increased levels of pollution and carbon emissions. It eventually contributes to global warming and climate change, that in turn negates the growth of the economy. Against this backdrop, decoupling economic growth due to housing expansion, from environmental impact is a multifaceted challenge to the construction industry. This paper presents a framework based on system dynamics to facilitate addressing the decoupling challenge associated with the provision of affordable housing in India. System dynamics based modeling facilitates to capture complex interactions and dynamic influences associated with a system and also helps in evaluating various policy scenarios. Hence, the proposed framework helps to evaluate the dynamic interactions between regulatory norms, economic fluctuation, social expectations, and environmental impacts in the process of providing affordable housing. The study shows that about 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions can be achieved in affordable housing projects through suitable decoupling measures and policies. The study concludes that to address the decoupling challenge in the frontier of affordable housing, the policies that reduce the environmental impacts associated with the production and consumption of construction materials should be given due attention along with strategies related to energy consumption during the use phase.

TI Contingency Management and Supply Chain Performance in Korea: A COVID-19
   Pandemic Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Unexpected incidents are driving global supply chains to the brink of collapse. To effectively manage contingency events like the COVID-19 pandemic and improve operational performance, factors such as information technology (IT), relational competencies, cooperation with supply chain partners and integration of supply chain systems that contribute to cooperation are essential. This study found that IT and relational competencies positively influence the integration of supply chain systems, and relational competencies have a stronger implication on supply chain integration and collaboration. In addition, supply chain collaboration, strengthened by supply chain integration, positively affects contingency management. Finally, contingency management positively influences operational performance. In this study, we adopted partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method in the analysis with 102 surveys collected from business managers. Through the evaluation of determinants of contingency management and supply chain performance, this study widens the theoretical base of supply chain management and provides managers with optimal ways to build a more resilient supply chain system to cope with unexpected incidents. Consequently, with collaboration-based contingency management, companies can solve problems properly and reduce additional loss, which will enhance operational performance and enable sustainable business success.

TI Housing for the urban poor: towards alternative financing strategies for
   low-income housing development in Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
AB This article aims to provide an understanding of the housing market situation in Ghana, the financing instruments available and the challenges faced by low-income households in accessing housing finance. The gap between income and house prices is shown to be huge across different groups in Ghana. It is also demonstrated that conventional mortgage finance is inaccessible to low-income households due to high payment-to-income ratios, lack of cash for down-payments and long repayment periods. Three alternative housing finance strategies are proposed: first, practical approaches to financing housing development through the spatial planning system; second, strategies to develop and make housing microfinance accessible to low-income households; and third, strategies to mobilise labour for housing development at reduced costs through community-based initiatives. Together, these alternative strategies could provide sustainable and affordable housing finance options for low-income housing development in Ghana.

TI A year-assessment of the suitability of a green facade to improve
   thermal performance of an affordable housing
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The urban green infrastructure has been increasingly used for sustainable design and resilient cities. Despite its many benefits, such as aesthetic enhancement, improvement of the physical and mental health of residents, especially for vulnerable youth and elderly people, or creating opportunities for social cohesion and climate regulation, green infrastructure has not been used in low-income housing in subtropical Brazil, where the temperature can reach over 40 degrees C along the summer. This study evaluated a full-scale, low-cost green facade over a year to assess its effect on the thermal performance of an eco-friendly affordable housing located in humid subtropical climate. Aiming to be eco-friendly and keep its cost low, the house was built with materials such as unplastered hollow soil-cement bricks, not having very good thermal performance. The Wisteria floribunda, a deciduous vine, was used in the green facade installed on a west-facing wall, adjacent to a bare wall, which was also evaluated enabling to establish the thermal difference between the shaded wall and the bare wall. In the winter, the shaded and bare walls' amplitudes were remarkably close, due to leaf shedding, a desirable feature to improve temperatures within the house. The benefits of the green facade were clearer during spring and summer when the external surface temperature of the shaded wall was reduced by up to 9 degrees C compared to the bare wall, and its thermal amplitude varied by 8.4 degrees C, while the amplitude of the bare wall was more than double this value. The plant layer diminished the heat flux through the external wall by up to 22.3 W/m2 during the summer, and 8 W/m2 during the winter. These results show the potential of a low-cost green facade to improve the thermal comfort of green affordable housing projects.

AB Numerous mandatory energy efficiency building standards and rating systems have been developed globally. The International Passive House Standard is a voluntary alternative, but there is little data on the performance of houses built to this standard in Australia. One house in suburban Canberra demonstrates that the Passive House Standard can be used to build high-performance houses with predictable outcomes. Extreme energy efficiency and occupant comfort were key performance objectives in building the three-bedroom house. Like most energy efficient housing projects in Australia, the building was designed to take advantage of solar gain, thermal mass and cross flow ventilation, but what set this project and all Passive House projects apart was the careful attention to airtightness, mechanical ventilation, avoidance of thermal bridging and the use of energy modelling tools at the design stage.
   The result was a house that required virtually no heating in winter despite frosty -2 degrees C mornings; no artificial cooling in summer despite 37 degrees C days and; overall consumed 64% less energy than similar households in the same city. Energy consumption, temperature and CO2 levels have been monitored and confirm exceptional levels of comfort and indoor air quality. The total energy consumed was within 12% of predicted values thus supporting the effectiveness of the Passive House Standard. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB PurposeThis pathway paper offers research guidance for investigating illegal supply chains as they increasingly threaten societies, economies and ecosystems. There are implications for policy makers to consider incorporating supply chain expertise.Design/methodology/approachThe authors' work is informed by the team's previous and ongoing studies, research from fields such as criminology, investigative journalism and legal documents.FindingsIllegality occurs in many supply chains and consists in multiple forms. Certain sectors, supply chain innovations, longer supply chains, and heterogeneous regulations and enforcement exacerbate illegal activities. But illegal activity may be necessary for humanitarian, religious or nationalistic reasons. These areas are under explored by supply chain researchers.Research limitations/implicationsBy encouraging supply chain academics to research in this area as well as form collaborative partnerships outside of the discipline, the authors hope to move the field forward in prevention as well as learning from illegal supply chains.Practical implicationsPractitioners seek to prevent issues like counterfeiting with their products as well as fraud for economic and reputational reasons.Social implicationsGovernments strive to minimise impacts on their economies and people, and both governments and NGOs attempt to minimise the negative social and environmental impacts. Policy makers need supply chain researchers to evaluate new laws to prevent enabling illegality in supply chains.Originality/valueAs an under-explored area, the authors suggest pathways such as partnering with other disciplines, exploring why these supply chains occur, considering other data sources and methodologies to interdict illegality and learning from illegal supply chains to improve legal supply chains.

We propose the use of On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) multidimensional systems as the basis of the supply chain intelligence (SCI) initiative. In this paper, the original supply chain process metamodel which enables modeling of any supply network (structure, processes, and metrics) is presented. Also, a novel Unified Dimensional Model (UDM) that provides a common interface, centralized metadata, and complex analytical calculation repository is described. Finally, the basic features of the real-world composite SCI Web portal are presented. It provides user-friendly environment for collaborative supply chain analysis and more intelligent decision making.

Results of these efforts have often disappointed in terms of quality, productivity and sustainability issues. Firms need to take a strategic view of offshoring decisions emphasising the role foreign production plays in their supply chain. Modern systems, such as lean production, require a tightly linked global supply chain. Lean production also fosters a sustainable global supply chain making practices such as sweatshop working conditions and environmental pollution incompatible and uneconomic.

SO ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL
AB Amid rising uncertainty in the global economy and unprecedented economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of supply chain resilience has gained increasing popularity in ASEAN and the EU. However, by comparing their paths to resilient supply chains, this article argues that while both organizations regard resilience as a departure from past doctrines of pure economic efficiency, each has a different understanding of and approach to supply chain resilience. While for ASEAN, supply chain resilience is meant to reconcile inward- and outward-looking dimensions to support ASEAN competitiveness, within the EU, resilience is associated with the search for strategic autonomy with an internal focus. Despite these differences, both groups regard sustainability and digital transformation as crucial components of supply chain resilience, which they see as a way to enhance their economic cooperation and strategic partnership.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB The fresh food supply chain in China has begun to reduce the number of intermediaries that connect producers and consumers. Using farm-level data, this paper investigates the impacts of short supply chain participation on vegetable farmers' market performance, including profits, productivity, production cost, price and price risk. The results show that the participation in a short supply chain is a profit-maximising strategy and risk management tool for farmers. The increase in profit is attributed to productivity advantages, farm size expansion, and risk reduction rather than because of price premiums or cost savings. A policy implication is that short supply chain promotion has many benefits, but the government should be more concerned about the sustainability of short supply chains.

AB When a supply chain model is translated into a relatively new and revolutionary mathematical dimension that reveals the location of tipping points, a critical resilience index can be extracted that measures whether supply chains are sustainable or close to collapse. This paper shows the translation of supply chain dynamics equations into this effective plane, the extraction of the critical resilience index, and simulation results that show how the resilience index correlates with stability of the supply chain. These results have great potential for improving the understanding of supply chain management, revealing how close a supply chain is to collapse and providing a metric to help make supply chains more sustainable. For example, one potential application is to use this model to ensure that agri-food supply chains are resilient to continue supporting growing populations.

A survey-study approach is followed for the collection of data, and partial least squares approach is applied to examine the critical factors. The findings show 'Green innovation' to be the most critical factor, followed by 'Management support and coordination', 'Design for recovery' and 'Managing product returns'. The study guides the managers in Indian small and medium manufacturing enterprises on critical factors for closed-loop supply chain operations. The study also extends the knowledge on closed-loop supply chain by identifying the critical factors in Indian small and medium manufacturing enterprises.

TI A comprehensive assessment of the life cycle energy demand of passive
   houses
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Certifications such as the Passive House aim to reduce the final space heating energy demand of residential buildings. The latter are responsible for a significant share of final energy consumption in Europe of which nearly 70% is associated with space conditioning, notably heating. The improvement of the energy efficiency of residential buildings, in terms of space heating, can therefore reduce their total energy demand.
   However, most certifications totally overlook other energy requirements associated with residential buildings. Studies on passive houses do not take into consideration the embodied energy required to manufacture the building materials, especially the large amount of insulation required to achieve high operational efficiencies. At an urban scale, most passive houses are single family detached houses located in low density suburbs with a high car usage, resulting in considerable transport related energy demand.
   This paper analyses the total life cycle energy demand of a typical Belgian passive house, comprising embodied, operational and transport energy. It relies on a comprehensive technique developed by Stephan et al. [1] and conducts a parametric analysis as well as a comparison to alternative building types.
   Results show that current building energy efficiency certifications might not ensure a lower energy demand and can, paradoxically result in an increased energy consumption because of their limited scope. More comprehensive system boundaries should be used to make sure that net energy savings do occur. The embodied energy of passive houses can represent up to 77% of the total embodied and operational energy over 100 years. Also passive houses can have nearly the same energy consumption as a standard new house with the same geometry, location and number of occupants. A retrofitted apartment in the city has an energy consumption 15.2% lower than the best passive house scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Open supply chain innovation: an extended view on supply chain
   collaboration
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose In the ever-increasing dynamics of global business markets, firms must use all possible sources to innovate continually. This study aims to explore how supply chain innovation can be fostered through joint efforts between firms and their supply chain partners. Design/methodology/approach At least two areas advocate innovation through external relations, namely, supply chain collaboration and open innovation. This study aims to provide a holistic insight into how vertical and horizontal partnerships can be implemented to help supply chains become more innovative, building upon commonalities and differences between the two areas. Findings This study proposes a conceptual framework for supply chain innovation based on the following three ambidextrous capabilities: purpose (i.e. knowledge exploration and exploitation), span (horizontal and vertical collaboration) and orientation (i.e. incremental and radical innovation). With five propositions, the link between the three ambidextrous capabilities and supply chain innovation is explained. The implementation of the framework is articulated through an illustrative real-life case. Originality/value The concept of open innovation in supply chain settings is progressively essential yet under-researched. This study is an early attempt to draw on the available theories and literature on open innovation and supply chain collaboration and elaborates how supply chains can facilitate and adopt a more open approach toward innovation.

TI In search of a circular supply chain archetype - a
   content-analysis-based literature review
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB This paper addresses questions of how extant research discourses concerning the sustainability of supply chains contribute to understanding about circularity in supply chain configurations that support restorative and regenerative processes, as espoused by the Circular Economy ideal. In response to these questions, we develop a content-based literature analysis to progress theoretical body of knowledge and conceptualise the notion of a circular supply chain. We derive an archetypal form from four antecedent sustainable supply chain narratives - reverse logistics', green supply chains', sustainable supply chain management' and closed-loop supply chains'. This paper offers five propositions about what the circular supply chain archetype represents in terms of its scope, focus and impact. Novel insights lead to a definition of circular supply chain and a more coherent foundation for future inquiry and practice.

TI The dark side of sustainable dairy supply chains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the dark side of supermarket-driven sustainable dairy supply chains. This paper raises questions about the unintended consequences of implementing sustainable supply chain management in the dairy food supply chain. It critically questions whether unintended consequences were actually, anticipated, as the course of action taken by retailers reinforces the dominant profitability discourse. Design/methodology/approach Through a critical management studies approach, this paper challenges the dominant discourse to shed light on the social consequences of the win-win sustainable supply chain management in the dairy food supply chain. The focus of this paper is on the experiences of farmers, taking their viewpoint of sustainable supply chains rather than taking the perspective of the multinationals who have traditionally been the focus of supply chain management research (e.g. McCarthyet al., 2018; Quarshieet al., 2016). Findings The study illuminates how retailers have bolstered their dominant position through using sustainable supply chains to exert further control over their suppliers. The management of sustainable supply chains has been a further catalyst in economically and socially dividing rural communities and creating tensions between dairy farmers. Originality/value This paper uses an ethnographic study to provide in-depth stories of the changes that took place within one farming community. It exposes the hidden ways in which the introduction of a sustainable dairy supply chain has created social and economic division, further reducing the collective power of dairy farmers through creating a dual supply chain.

TI Exploring circular supply chain practices from a dual perspective: using
   a hybrid method under uncertainty
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Circular supply chains have received increasing attention due to their contributions to the reduction of resource waste and the improvement of resource utilisation efficiency. To comprehensively and systematically gain deeper insight into circular supply chain practices, this paper adopts a dual perspective and proposes a hybrid method considering the relationship between the circular supply chain practices in each link to analyse critical circular supply chain practices. Specifically, first, a system of circular supply chain practices based on the 3R principle (reduce, reuse and recycle) of the circular economy and the whole supply chain process is built. Then, a hybrid method integrating fuzzy set theory, the Delphi method and a Bayesian network is proposed to identify the critical criteria of circular supply chain practices. The results show that using mechanised and automatic equipment, extending the service life of products through technological innovation, using energy-saving technology, working with middlemen to develop measures to encourage consumers to return secondhand products after use and working with middlemen to motivate consumers to buy products using recyclable materials are the top five critical practices. Firms should consider the priority of practices from the perspective of the whole supply chain. Finally, some corresponding suggestions are provided.

TI WORLD ECONOMY AS GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN'S NETWORK
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB World trade and production are increasingly structured around "global value chains" (GVCs). A value chain identifies the full range of activities that firms undertake to bring a product or a service from its conception to its end use by final consumers. Technological progress, cost, access to resources and markets and trade policy reforms have facilitated the geographical fragmentation of production processes across the globe according to the comparative advantage of the locations. This international fragmentation of production is a powerful source of increased efficiency and firm competitiveness. Today, more than half of world manufactured imports are intermediate goods (primary goods, parts and components, semi-finished products), and more than 70% of world services imports are intermediate services. The emergence of GVCs during the last two decades has implications in many areas, including trade, investment and industrial development. Some of these implications have been explored in recent OECD work but the empirical evidence on GVCs remains limited. The last few years have witnessed a growing number of case studies on the globally integrated value chains at the product level, but such analyses only depict the situation for a specific product. The main objective of the article is to provide more and better evidence allowing to examine the position of countries within international production networks. The author deals with quantitative indicators that give a more accurate picture of the integration and position of countries in GVCs. A detailed assessment of global value chains is provided in six industries: agriculture and food products, chemicals, electrical and computing machinery, motor vehicles, business services, financial services.

   EMERGING ECONOMIES
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB The aim of the research developed is to recognize the importance and impact of supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) in the horizontal collaboration as a relevant factor to mitigate the risks in the supply chain, but also to contribute to sustainability in SME's that are located in emerging economies, even more face to the post-pandemic scenario. The methodology used to analyze the theoretical constructs related to the study was PRISMA declaration. It was applied using several databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and specific search equations investigating several lenses related to supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) as an adjuvant to create and promote horizontal collaborative networks (HCN). It mitigates the risks through collaborative processes between actors in the supply chain, developing resilience. The lenses considered are dynamic capabilities view, supply chain resilience and collaborative networks. The study results reveal that collaborative networks could support the risk management in supply chains that develop this practice. In the same way, supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) can be considered as a relevant factor in stimulating integration between different and exogenous actors of the supply chain in a horizontal collaboration, and also considering the collaboration as one of the most important supply chain dynamic capability (SCDC) to be developed for SME's as a good way to dynamize their supply chains, avoid the risk and as a good practice to improve the corporate sustainability in emerging markets.

TI Main Dimensions in the Building of the Circular Supply Chain: A
   Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention from researchers. The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes. However, dimensions related to the business environment such as sectoral, legislative, and fiscal frameworks must be incorporated.

TI The value of advance payment financing to carbon emission reduction and
   production in a supply chain with game theory analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB This paper investigates the value of advance payment financing to carbon emission reduction and production in a supply chain. We discuss two models, namely, (1) a supply chain model with a manufacturer that is not capital-constrained, under the conditions of being with and without advance payment financing, and (2) a supply chain model with a capital-constrained manufacturer, under the conditions of using bank financing and mixed financing. We characterize and compare the optimal solutions in the two supply chain models and then extend the models with cap-and-trade regulation and general stochastic demand. We find that in the supply chain model without a capital-constrained manufacturer, advance payment financing with a low-price discount can increase the supply chain partners' profits. However, in the supply chain model with a capital-constrained manufacturer, when the manufacturer's production cost is high, mixed financing with a low-price discount can improve both partners' profits. Furthermore, in the model with a capital-constrained manufacturer, when the manufacturer's carbon emission reduction efficiency is high, the use of mixed financing can encourage the manufacturer to increase carbon emission reductions. The results help the manufacturer and the retailer to decide whether to join in advance payment financing.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This study combined the input-output clustering analysis and structural path betweenness analysis, and identified critical sectors belonging to important emission clusters in the global supply chain networks associated with final demand of transport equipment in five countries (United States, China, Germany, Japan, and France). Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries.

TI Bridging the supply chain resilience research and practice gaps: pre and
   post COVID-19 perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB Purpose In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, all business sectors have critical needs. They face multiple challenges to restructuring their operations to build a resilient, cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the practice and the research gaps related to supply chains. Design/methodology/approach This research paper is influenced by a literature review of the past decade. This review paper incorporates industry challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including future steps toward developing resilient supply chains in the new normal economy. The research provides a detailed framework for designing cost-effective survivable supply chains that withstand disruptions for the long term. Findings The proposed research focuses on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and attempts to bridge pre and post COVID-19 research and practice gaps. Post-COVID-19 resilient supply chains need to be transformed into survivable supply chains. The survivability of the supply chain can be achieved by combining both supply chain resilience and supply chain viability measures. To the best of the authors' belief, this is the first study that grounds a theory to provide interconnection of five critical supply chain concepts to manage supply chain risk. This study is uniquely positioned to develop a theoretical framework to design a cost-effective, resilient and sustainable supply chain by establishing the interconnection among these concepts in supply chains. This framework helps practitioners to implement the key strategies at the operational, tactical and strategic levels that enhance maturity in supply chains. Research limitations/implications The research findings are based on secondary reports such as industry reports, cases, research papers and expert opinions. The authors tried to consult with many companies. However, they were reluctant to share the recovery plan information from COVID. Also, as COVID still exists in many places in Canada, the authors could not gather every intended information from the companies. However, the authors have successfully shared the outcomes of this research with a reputed retail company in Canada. They recognized the importance of survivability in supply chains. Going forward, business organizations need to design cost-effective, sustainable and survivable supply chains. Originality/value The study attempts to unify current research dealing with supply chain resilience. The study concludes with the limitations of the current research. It highlights the prospects of future research and bridges the supply chain practice gaps from the challenges faced by industries due to COVID-19. The study contributes to the literature by identifying gaps to bridge the supply chain practice and reiterating new research directions to develop a cost-effective, survivable and sustainable supply chain.

TI A novel SCOR approach to assess the sustainability of supply chains
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) is an appropriate method for assessing supply chains. SCOR defines supply chains' stages as follows: plan, source, make, deliver, and return. To examine these phases in terms of economic, social, and environmental aspects, the SCOR model is incorporated into the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) concept. Given that the case study deals with two-stage networks, i) a new network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model is developed to evaluate the divisional and overall efficiencies of supply chains. ii) In this study, NDEA and SCOR models are used to evaluate the sustainability of supply chains. iii) Furthermore, to deal with the interval data, a new NDEA model is developed. Some theorems prove the capabilities of the proposed new model. iv) To assess the sustainability of supply chains, given the interval data, the objective of this paper is to develop an interval network directional distance function of inefficiency (INDDFI) model based on the SCOR framework. v) The preference-based approach for comparing the efficiency intervals is provided to present the final ranking. vi) The proposed method is applied to assess the sustainability of supply chains in the printing industry. vii) A sensitivity analysis of the results is presented. According to the sensitivity analysis, it is found that the activities in the Making Division have the highest effect on the whole network structure.

TI Impacts of Counterfeiting on a Global Supply Chain
SO M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Problem definition: This paper investigates how counterfeits influence a global supply chain and how the supply chain should effectively take anticounterfeit actions. Academic/practical relevance: The impacts of counterfeiting have been increasingly profound on global supply chains. It is critical to understand how counterfeiting impacts supply chains when supply chain members act in their own interests, and how supply chains can effectively combat counterfeiting when all the members can contribute to it. This is the first paper that offers insights into these important questions. In particular, we examine who among the supply chain members is in the best position to perform counteracting activities, how these members can cooperate in anticounterfeiting, and what economic implications the anticounterfeit actions have to the supply chain, individual firms, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Methodology: We consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, and analyze a game-theoretical framework to derive the equilibrium. Results: The manufacturer prefers to induce the retailer to combat counterfeits rather than to combat itself. Contrary to conventional wisdom, counterfeits can increase the supply chain's profit even in the absence of network externality effects. The crux is that the manufacturer lowers wholesale price to incentivize the retailer's counteraction and, consequently, the threat of counterfeits can mitigate double marginalization and benefit the supply chain. Managerial implications: Our results demonstrate that a sustainability risk can trigger collaborative endeavors of supply chain members and thus be advantageous to the supply chain. The findings also underscore the important role that retailers should play in anticounterfeiting. Particularly, it can be in the supply chain's interest that the manufacturer does not execute the counteraction, either jointly with the retailer or by itself.

SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB Multi-tier supply chain sustainability is paramount to achieve corporate sustainability, due to the significant impacts from organisations beyond the focal firm boundaries and its direct suppliers. However, including environmental considerations within the dominant profit-centric logic of supply chain related decisions is prone to generate sustainability tensions. This work aims to support organisations address tensions between sustainability dimensions by adopting an integrative approach for sustainable supply chain management performance assessment thanks to an innovative eco-intensity based performance assessment method, which achieves a balanced consideration of environmental and economic performance in a weak sustainability perspective. The method, using primary data sourced from actual practice and featuring an indirect multi-tier approach with decentralised responsibilities across organisations, is applied to a case study of a machinery supply chain. The proposed integrative approach can support addressing sustainability tensions in the area of sustainable supply chain management, facilitate sustainable supplier evaluation and identify supply chain hotspots for operational improvement.

TI Managing Food Safety With Pricing, Contracts and Coordination in Supply
   Chains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study aims to design a safe and sustainable food supply chain with food safety mechanisms so that confidence-dependent demand can be positively affected by centralized, decentralized and combined supply chain contracts. To determine the optimal order quantity, buy-back price, rebate/penalty and sales target with the proposed framework, we derive the optimality conditions of corresponding models and use the results to analyze the lard oil supply chain. It is found that supply chain contracts together with the food safety mechanism can drastically improve food safety, consumer confidence and the resulting profits of a food supply chain. What differentiates our work from earlier research efforts is that only few studies have focused primarily on food safety mechanisms that embed a closed-loop supply chain to benefit all stakeholders of a supply chain and we attempt to bridge the gap. Further improvements can be developed based on the models developed in this study.

TI A Knowledge Network and Mobilisation Framework for Lean Supply Chain
   Decisions in Agri-Food Industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY
AB Making the right decisions for food supply chain is extremely important towards achieving sustainability in agricultural businesses. This paper explores that knowledge sharing to support food supply chain decisions to achieve lean performance (i.e. to reduce/eliminate non-value-adding activities, or "waste" in lean term). The focus of the paper is on defining new knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches to address the network and community nature of current supply chains. Based on critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in the topic area, a knowledge network and mobilisation framework for lean supply chain management has been developed. The framework has then been evaluated using a case study from the food supply chain. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to incorporate expert's view on the defined knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches with respect to their contribution to achieving various lean performance objectives. The results from the work have a number of implications for current knowledge management and supply chain management in theory and in practice.

TI Sharing Space to Age in Community: A Mixed-Methods Study of Homeshare
   Organizations
SO JOURNAL OF AGING & SOCIAL POLICY
AB As adults age, they often require more assistance with personal care needs and other daily living activities. Along with requiring more assistance, access to affordable housing options is also a concern. Homesharing has emerged as a potential means of addressing these housing challenges for older adults. In this study, we surveyed 23 homeshare organizations and interviewed 16 survey respondents to understand characteristics of homeshare organizations, populations served, and the homeshare model. Findings suggest that homeshare organizations use a high-touch matching approach and that they experience challenges to sustainability. Individuals who enter a match are a small subset of those who apply due to organizational eligibility criteria and characteristics of applicants that impact their suitability for homesharing. While homesharing is a niche housing option that is not appropriate for many people, future research should explore whether homesharing fills gaps in housing options for older adults and the outcomes of homesharing.

TI An innovative eco-intensity based method for assessing extended supply
   chain environmental sustainability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Organisations currently face increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders to improve their environmental performance. The majority of environmental impacts in a typical supply chain usually arise beyond the focal firm boundaries or even its direct suppliers. However, no method to assess the extended supply chain environmental performance that is designed to use real life data currently exists.
   The aim of this work is to facilitate quantitative assessment of the environmental performance of extended supply chains by introducing an innovative eco-intensity based method that relates the environmental performance of the supply chain to its economic output. The method is the first to allow assessing the environmental sustainability performance of extended supply chains based on real life data, while respecting the multiple-organisation nature and non-collaborative characteristics of the majority of real life supply chains. This is achieved through the adopted decentralised approach, materialised through a recursive mechanism to pass eco-intensity values from one tier to the next, which does not require visibility of the extended supply chain by any single member, thus enhancing the applicability of the method.
   The method is demonstrated through a numerical example with secondary data for four representative supply chains with different design features, to showcase its applicability. The CO2 emissions and water eco-intensities are calculated. The findings enable both benchmarking the eco-intensity performance of the extended supply chains and comparison of the eco-intensity indicators of the individual organisations, offering a basis to guide operational improvement and to support external reporting. The method has the potential to change the way organisations approach their environmental sustainability by facilitating understanding of the wider supply chain impact.

SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB The change of big data green supply chain strategy based on improved genetic optimization algorithm is one of the hot topics in green supply chain management. In order to realize the sustainable development of green supply chain, this paper constructs a big data green supply chain system based on improved genetic optimization algorithm. First of all, it is necessary to collect relevant data and pre-process the collected data to ensure the quality and consistency of the data. Then a mathematical model is established based on improved genetic optimization algorithm to describe the operation process of green supply chain. The improved genetic optimization algorithm can improve the search efficiency and optimization performance of genetic algorithm by improving genetic operators and adjusting parameters. Thirdly, the optimization model is solved to obtain the optimal supply chain scheme. Finally, the solution results are analyzed and evaluated to evaluate the optimization effect of green supply chain. The results show that the strategy change of big data green supply chain based on improved genetic optimization algorithm is one of the important means to realize the sustainable development of green supply chain. The big data green supply chain system based on improved genetic optimization algorithm constructed in this paper can optimize and improve the green supply chain, improve the operational efficiency and environmental performance of the green supply chain, and provide strong support for the sustainable development of the green supply chain.

However, in the research of Green Supply Chain Management there still exist deficiency of sustainability and worry of systematic. This article is to study the presently existing Green Supply Chain Management Models, and finally design a new type of Green Supply Chain Management Model with sustainability and systematic. The advantage of this model is to ensure that the supply chain can constantly protect the environment and to make each node of it profit through a more comprehensive management. In this new model four indicators are used: utilization rate of resources, price growth rate, investment recovery, and satisfaction, through which we hope to implement the Green Supply Chain Management sustainability and systematically, and to break through the locality and industry limitations in the study of Green Supply Chain Management.

TI Technological intelligence for circular supply chain: a co-citation
   analysis approach
SO FORESIGHT
AB Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply chains, and this brought researchers and practitioners to think about more on circular supply chains (CSC). The CSC concept has been discussed in the literature more than a decade. This study aims to find out the theoretical roots of CSC by analyzing scholarly articles in literature. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses document cocitation analysis for reaching this aim. After retrieving data from Web of Science database, this paper explores data set by considering used references of these publications and clusters them based on their title terms and visualizes them by using cosine similarity index. Findings This paper concludes that CSC is mainly discussed along with sustainability, sustainable supply chains and green supply chains, where the focus is integrating circular economy principles to supply chain management (SCM). On the other hand, although resiliency is an essential characteristic of SCM, contribution of CSC to supply chain resilience is neglected in the literature. Research limitations/implications CSC will gain importance in near future to increase national/firm productivity, and findings of this paper will give researchers insights for furthering their studies. Social implications To avoid supply chain and market collapse caused by natural disruptions, supply chain resilience is of paramount importance. According to the findings of this paper, the authors believe that business resilience in COVID-19-restricted environment may have exit point by using circular perspective. Originality/value The importance of CSC has increased due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this unique study was undertaken to investigate the evolution of this crucial topic with evidence from the literature through a cocitation analysis.

TI Explaining the stickiness of supply chain relations in the Brazilian
   soybean trade
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB The global trade of agricultural commodities has profound social-ecological impacts, from potentially increasing food availability and agricultural efficiency, to displacing local communities, and to incentivizing environmental destruction. Supply chain stickiness, understood as the stability in trading relationships between supply chain actors, moderates the impacts of agricultural commodity production and the possibilities for supply-chain in-terventions. However, what factors determine stickiness, that is, how and why farmers, traders, food processors, and consumer countries, develop and maintain trading relationships with specific producing regions, remains unclear. Here, we use data on the Brazilian soy supply chain, a mixed methods approach based on extensive actor-based fieldwork, and an explanatory regression model, to identify and explore the factors that influence stickiness between places of production and supply chain actors. We find four groups of factors to be important: economic incentives, institutional enablers and constraints, social and power dimensions, and biophysical and technological conditions. Among the factors we explore, surplus capacity in soy processing infrastructure, (i.e., crushing and storage facilities) is important in increasing stickiness, as is export-oriented production. Conversely, volatility in market demand expressed by farm-gate soy prices and lower land-tenure security are key factors reducing stickiness. Importantly, we uncover heterogeneity and context-specificity in the factors determining stickiness, suggesting tailored supply-chain interventions are beneficial. Understanding supply chain stickiness does not, in itself, provide silver-bullet solutions to stopping deforestation, but it is a crucial prerequisite to understanding the relationships between supply chain actors and producing regions, identifying entry points for supply chain sustainability interventions, assessing the effectiveness of such interventions, forecasting the restructuring of trade flows, and considering sourcing patterns of supply chain actors in territorial planning.

TI A supply chain network with product remanufacturing and carbon emission
   considerations: a two-phase design
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB Growing awareness of environmental issues is prompting the development of sustainable supply chain management. Closed-loop supply chains in which used products can be returned for remanufacture are becoming increasingly popular. This paper introduces a two-phase approach to the design of supply chain networks taking into account carbon emission and remanufacturing. In the first phase, a continuous approximation model is used to design the forward supply chain network. The objective is to minimize the total forward network cost by simultaneously determining the number and the service areas of distribution centers (DCs) and the replenishment cycle time for DCs. A nonlinear optimization technique is used to solve the forward supply chain network design problem. In the second phase, a reverse supply chain network is formulated based on the results of the first phase to determine the optimal number and service areas of remanufacturing centers (RCs) and the replenishment cycle time for RCs. Finally, numerical analyses are conducted to show the solution approach and provide some managerial insights.

TI Framing sustainability performance of supply chains with
   multidimensional indicators
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - This paper aims to provide a framework which can assist focal companies in the development of sustainable supply chains. Sustainable development from an industrial perspective has extended beyond organisational boundaries to incorporate a supply chain approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The literature related to sustainable supply chain management is reviewed by incorporating concepts from four organisational theories, including the resource-based, institutional, stakeholder and social network perspectives, to illustrate key drivers and enablers of sustainability initiatives in the supply chain. A conceptual multidimensional framework is then developed that can be used for the initial assessment of supply chain sustainability.
   Findings - Development and assessment of sustainability in supply chains are being increasingly incorporated as part of supply chain management today. This paper presents a multidimensional framework which can serve as a tool for research scholars and supply chain practitioners in identifying and assessing various economic, environmental and social performance indicators.
   Research limitations/implications - The framework and approach presented are conceptual, and require additional and broader validation. Additional theories, at differing levels, such as individual behaviour theory, should be utilised to further enhance and evaluate the framework. Developing and integrating analytical models for prescriptive and practical supply chain solutions can enhance the applicability of the framework.
   Practical implications - The framework adopts a multidimensional approach to assessing and designing sustainable supply chains, as it not only incorporates economic and environmental dimensions but also provides a practical approach to quantifying and embedding the social dimension into decision-making. The framework helps industry practitioners in initial exploration of trade-offs among economic, environmental and social performance of supply chains, which, in turn, could assist them in creating a business case for sustainability.
   Originality/value - The paper is one of few studies that incorporates some of the key aspects of all three dimensions of sustainability in a single overarching framework for supply chains and offers significant theoretical contribution and implications for sustainable supply chain management.

AB The drive to reduce carbon emissions and energy utilisation directly associated with dwellings suggests that the energy efficiency of dwellings will have an increasingly prioritised role in the built environment. Created by the Passive House Institute, Passive House is a low-energy building standard that can reduce the energy use of a building. Passive Houses have been built in many parts of the world; with the first Passive House in Scotland completed recently. Monitoring and modelling advances in building design and technology can be useful to improve future constructions and technology applications. This paper describes the monitoring and modelling of a Passive House in Dunoon, Scotland. Monitoring results suggest that the Passive House approach is applicable in a Scottish climate and could be valuable to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency in dwellings. Modelling results suggest that simulation can be used to influence the design process; especially in low energy buildings as dynamic simulation can offer a quicker and cheaper alternative to experimental field trails.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING
AB A Passive House's airtight, well-insulated building envelope can lower operating energy use but also increase the possibility of overheating during the summer. The Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) Excel modelling tool for Passive Houses treats the entire structure as a single thermal zone; this simplification may be in part to blame for the instrument's poor capacity to forecast the risk of overheating. The current study offers new information on two subjects. First, we compare PHPP's overheating evaluation method to that of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers' (CIBSE) 'TM59' standard, which involves conducting dynamic energy modelling at the room level. Our results support the idea that PHPP underestimates overheating. In the analysed case, glazing solar heat gain coefficient, and air change rate were some of the most crucial factors affecting compliance. Second, we highlight the usefulness of parametric design for compliance.

AB Many developments associated with globalization have forced companies to manage their supply chains effectively and to mitigate various kinds of chain risks in them. In this study, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to determine the most important supply chain risks and the corresponding risk management strategies. The research is conducted with the supply chain management of a company operating in the iron and steel industry. Findings indicate that supply risks and operational risks are quite important compared to environmental risks. Also, control/sharing/transfer strategy is followed by hedging, speculation, and postponement strategies in terms of the scope and intensity of their effects on different risk types.

TI Strategy Optimization of Supply Chain Enterprises Based on Fuzzy
   Decision Making Model in Internet of Things
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment.

AB The choice of materials for a building with high energy efficiency becomes much more important and strategies for reducing the use of primary energy for the production of materials and components becomes key. The positive trend towards wooden construction is dictated by international guidelines, where a wooden building is an important starting point, not only for low-energy, but also low-emission building with exceptional health and safety aspects. In Europe, the most comprehensive and widely used is a concept of ultra-low energy house, more precisely, the passive house concept.
   Most Slovenian buildings combine contemporary styling with a degree of energy efficiency that comes close to passive house standards. It is widely recognised that the Slovenian construction industry is relatively advanced in the field of low energy buildings. In the light of the growing importance of energy-efficient building methods, it could be said that timber passive house would play an increasingly important role in the future.

TI Barriers to green supply chain management: An emerging economy context
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Green supply chain management is attracting increasing attention as a way to decrease the adverse environmental effects of industries worldwide. However, considering the context of an emerging economy like Bangladesh, green supply chain management is still in its inception and has not been widely embraced in the textile industry, and therefore barriers hindering its adoption in emerging economy context demand a comprehensive investigation. This research reviews the viewpoints and hurdles in adopting green supply chain management practices in the context of the Bangladeshi textile industry. A questionnaire survey of Bangladeshi textile practitioners of operations and supply chain management division, having a sample size of thirty, was undertaken to identify the barriers, and a hierarchical cluster analysis technique was used in the detailed analysis of this data. Opinions were sought from experts on the significance of the resulting clusters, considering the relative importance of the barriers. Fifteen barriers to the adoption of green supply chain management were identified in the review of the literature, with these barriers then analyzed by using the data collected from Bangladeshi textile industry practitioners. The research indicates that the most important barrier is that there is low demand from customers and financial constraint resulting from short term little financial benefit to businesses, with lack of government regulations also a commonly faced barrier in adopting green supply chain initiatives. This study will provide valuables insights to practitioners and relevant policy makers about the barriers prevailing in the emerging economies towards the adoption of green supply chain management practices, which, in turn, can guide to undertake appropriate steps for alleviating those barriers.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB The paper suggests an intuitionistic fuzzy operator to assess supply chain risk. With the global economic integration trend, more and more enterprises adopt the modern management model of supply chain in order to have access to the advantage of responding quickly to the market demand. Through the implementation of supply chain management, their management efficiency has been significantly improved which led to brought good economic benefits. However, at the same time risk is becoming an unavoidable problem for the enterprises in supply chain, because of the uncertainty of the environment of the supply chain and the ever-increasing complexity of its own. The management of supply chain risk assessment has attracted increasing attention of theoretical and business research. The study investigates the supply chain risk assessment with intuitionistic fuzzy information, and then proposes a dependent intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric (DIFHWG) operator. This operator is used to design an algorithm for supply chain risk assessment with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, several experiments are conducted to verify the developed method.

TI Green Supply Chains and the Missing Link Between Environmental
   Information and Practice
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Within the field of green supply chain management (GSCM), an interest in supply chain cooperation to create sustainable competitive advantage, i.e. the collaborative paradigm, has made researchers turn their attention to information related aspects of the supply chain. This study contributes to an understanding of a suboptimal use of environmental information, which is critical for all collaborative efforts aiming at sustainable competitive advantage. The aim of this article is to describe the use of environmental information at different stages of the Swedish food supply chain. The results from this case study of the Swedish food supply chain indicate that environmental information is perceived and used differently by purchasers in the supply chain depending on where ( in the supply chain) they are situated in relation to other chain actors. The main contribution of this study is the suggestion of a stage-dependent connection between perceived environmental cost and perceived environmentally informed consumer demand, which are barriers to GSCM practice discussed in recent GSCM literature. The missing link between information sharing and (environmental) performance of supply chains is explained as distance to end-consumer in terms of supply chain stages. Implications for GSCM practice and theory are discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB International trade, through global supply chains, is central to global sustainable production and consumption. Redistribution of environmental resources impacts through international trade has become apparent in ecological research - and may have long-term design and planning implications for production and supply chain management. However, current trade and production accounting methods are still incapable of providing accurate and reliable results for policymakers and organisational decision makers to manage global and supply chain trade issues. In this study, a blockchain-based conceptual framework for embodied environmental resources accounting in trade is proposed to address global supply chain and trade issues. Framework design, benefits, and challenges are also discussed. Future research and linkage to theory are also provided. This study provides a strong systemic foundation for managing environmental resources at the nexus of international trade, sustainable production, and global supply chains.

TI Green supply chain poverty alleviation through microfinance game model
   and cooperative analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study was motivated by the activation of recent poverty alleviation practices within green supply chains. Specifically, this paper examined supply chain operations when the supply chain participants acted individually and cooperatively in a "green poverty alleviation" supply chain in which the manufacturer initiated product "greening" and provided microfinance to alleviate the poverty of poor raw materials suppliers. A series of supply chain game models were examined to elucidate the impact of the cooperative mechanisms on the greening levels, prices and profits, after which the impact of consumer green sensitivities and microfinance interest rates were examined. Consequently, an optimal cooperative mechanism was developed based on a two-part tariff contract. The key contributions in this paper are the establishment of a decision-making model for a cooperative supply chain mechanism and an optimal cooperative mechanism to initiate "green poverty alleviation" to solve the problems associated with the high microfinance interest rates. Practical implications and managerial insights about improving the economic and environmental performance of supply chain "green poverty alleviation" through cooperation are also presented.

TI How do supply chain managers perceive the relationship between
   resilience and sustainability practices? An exploratory study
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Even though resilience and sustainability are the two overarching strategic goals of contemporary supply chain management, very few studies have investigated the relationship between resilience and sustainability practices. To increase our theoretical understanding of this important relationship, this paper examines the extent to which supply chain managers perceive tensions and complementarities between both sets of practices. Using a paradox theory lens, the paper conducted in-depth interviews with 31 supply chain managers in Western Europe and the Middle East that reveal a complex and multifaceted relationship. Namely, our findings indicate that some supply chain managers perceive the relationship as conflictive, others as synergistic, whereas a third group sees them as fundamentally orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, our findings uncover specific perceived complementarities and tension areas. Taken together, in responding to calls for research on the topic, our findings contribute to the advancement of theory regarding supply chain resilience and supply chain sustainability practices and address the need to shed more light on the tensions faced by supply chain managers when implementing distinct sets of supply chain practices.

TI An adaptive framework for aligning (re)planning decisions on supply
   chain strategy, design, tactics, and operations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Over the last decade, a wealth of valuable approaches to supply chain strategic, tactical, and operational planning has been extensively developed. However, conventionally the planning decisions at each of these levels have been considered in isolation from the other levels. Moreover, decisions on supply chain strategy, design, tactics, and operations are interlinked and dispersed over different supply chain structures (functional, organisational, informational, financial, etc.). This study develops a framework to increase the efficiency, consistency, implacability, and sustainability of decisions on how to design, plan, and run supply chains. In this paper it is proposed that comprehensive planning as an adaptive process encapsulates the planning decisions to be interrelated at all the decision-making levels. A conceptual model is described interlinking the supply chain strategy, design, planning, and operations on adaptation principles. Subsequently, a mathematical modelling complex and its realisation in a software environment is presented. This study contributes to developing methodical basics and practical tools to transit from simple open time slots incremental planning to dynamic, feedback-based adaptive supply chain planning. The elaborated framework serves to increase the efficiency, consistency, implacability, and sustainability of decisions on supply chain strategy, design, tactics, and operations. Decisions alignment can help to increase the wealth of organisations by producing demand-corresponding products in the most cost-effective manner through increasing agility, responsiveness, reaction speed to market changes, and continuous comprehensive improvements/adaptation of supply chains.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper analyzes the effect of circular economy practices on firm performance for a circular supply chain and explores the moderating role that big-data-driven supply chain plays within these relationships. Design/methodology/approach This study uses data collected through an online survey distributed to managers of 378 Italian firms that have adopted circular economy principles. The data are processed using multiple regression analysis. Findings The results indicate that the three categories of circular economy practices investigated - namely circular economy supply chain management design, circular economy supply chain relationship management and circular economy HR management - play a crucial role in enhancing firm performance from a circular economy perspective. A big-data-driven supply chain acts as a moderator of the relationship between circular economy HR management and firm performance for a circular economy supply chain. Originality/value This study makes a number of original contributions to research on circular economy practices in a big-data-driven supply chain and provides useful insights for practitioners. First, it answers the call to capture digital transformation trends and to extend research on sustainability in supply chain management. Second, it enhances the literature by investigating the relationships between three different kinds of circular economy supply chain practices and firm performance. Finally, it clarifies the moderating role of big data in making decisions and implementing circular supply chain solutions to achieve better environmental, social and economic benefits.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The emerging Information and Communication Technology play a vital role in electronic agriculture. The application of such technologies as blockchain, Internet-of-Things, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and machine learning can improve the agri-food supply chain efficiency and quality management. However, there is little evidence on the determinants of blockchain integrated ICTs adoption for the supply chain actors and their propensity to embrace and use such technologies. To bridge this research gap in the literature, we identify a few potential drivers of blockchain technology adoption, considering the grape wine supply chain and employing a rating-based conjoint analysis. The study finds that dis-intermediation, traceability, price, trust, compliance, and coordination and control in order of their relative importance and utilities can influence the supply chain actors' adoption-intention decision processes. The adoption factors further rationalize the design for a modular, scalable, interoperable, and cost-effective architecture for supply chain integration and sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose It is crucial to recognize that supply chain flexibility is important to build sustainable competitive edge in coping with uncertainty. This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent factor. Design/methodology/approach The online survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results of this study demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives. This study is expected to provide practitioners the foundation to implement supply chain flexibility considering the interrelationships among flexibility dimensions. Our results suggest that to carry out a supply chain flexibility strategy, the vertical complexity of the supply chain structure needs to be taken into consideration.

TI Beyond Partnerships: The Power of Lean Supply Chains
SO TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT: TECHNOLOGIES AND
   METHODOLOGIES
SE Springer Series in Advanced Manufacturing
AB Managing an integrated supply chain has become a necessary capability for competing in the global market. Cooperating with business partners prevents duplicating efforts and allows a company to focus on its core competencies. Hence, collaborating companies together have the potential to form a strong supply chain. At the individual company level, practitioners of lean concepts have demonstrated dramatic improvements in productivity within their manufacturing facilities. However, the potential benefits of lean implementation are limited to four walls of companies when business partners are excluded from integrating into a leaner overall value stream. The flow from a lean supplier to a lean customer may not be lean if the two parties are not synchronized. As a result, the supply chain formed within lean companies may not be lean after all, due to lack of cooperation and synchronization among participating companies. Extending the value stream from a lean company to its partners allows the company to widen the pursuit for perfection to the whole supply network. Furthermore, applying lean concepts to a supply chain opens new windows of opportunity for supply chain participants to collectively achieve higher levels of competitiveness. Thus, the integration of supply chain management and lean thinking covers both local and overall leanness, which leads to a truly lean supply chain. This chapter provides an overview of the lean supply chain, the including concepts, approaches, challenges, and future development. In the first part of the chapter, basic concepts and impacts of lean thinking will be introduced, followed by the issues of applying lean thinking in supply chain management. Then, an integrated framework of a lean supply chain will be presented. The second part of the chapter covers the building blocks of lean supply chains, including lean logistics, information technology, performance measurement and improvement, and collaboration beyond partnerships. Subsequently, the challenges for building or maintaining a sustainable lean supply chain will be discussed.

TI Trinomial tree based option pricing model in supply chain financing
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB With the rapid growth of the global digital economy, supply chain finance has entered the stage of platform development in view of the history, policy environment, market status and other factors. Supply chain finance relies on multiple supply chain stakeholders to carry out financial business, which needs to solve a variety of financial risk control and pricing issues. The financing model in supply chain finance can be differentiate from the traditional credit model. The service mode and leading mode of supply chain finance need to be adjusted in accordance with the changes of the industrial operation. Further, the business mode of supply chain finance shows a diversification trend, which includes traditional supply chain financial models such as accounts receivable, advance payment, inventory financing, and supply chain credit financing models. In this paper, we investigate the similarities between supply chain finance and options, and further introduce American call options to supply chain financial products under the mode of small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) accounts receivable financing. The price of supply chain financial products is derived through the trinomial tree option pricing model, which determines the corporate financing interest rates. The rationality of the proposed pricing model is validated in comparison with the medium and long-term load bank interest rates. The contribution of the paper is in providing SMEs with supply chain financial products under the accounts receivable model to resolve financing difficulties and the pricing the products through the trinomial budget pricing model.

TI A Proposal for a Green Supply Chain Strategy
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM
AB Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish a set of steps for helping companies to create a Green Supply Chain Strategy based on the reduction of their carbon footprint. The aim is to put forward a simple guideline that companies can follow and guide them in achieving their carbon emission targets, as well as obtaining attractive supply chain savings.
   Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature review and benchmarking this paper proposes a methodology based on three pillars: 1) Corporate Carbon Strategy; 2) Carbon emission roadmap; and 3) Implementation and tracking. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were used in order to create a green strategy and support the decision-making processes to select the most interesting alternatives for carbon emission reduction and supply chain savings. The supply chain of a metallurgical company is used to illustrate the case study where the proposed methodology is used. The criteria used for the carbon alternatives selection was based on three factors: 1) the supply chain cost of the alternative; 2) carbon emission impact in terms of CO2 tonnes; and 3) marketing effect.
   Findings: The paper identifies some specific steps for developing a Green Supply Chain Strategy. The case study developed, demonstrates the importance of following a proper methodology based on a set of steps, it also demonstrates that some alternatives focus on improving the supply chain, such as the facilities location, can also improve the key performance indicator related with carbon emission.
   Originality/value: The study provides guidance for manufacturing companies in implementing their Green Supply Chain Strategy.

TI Optimising Sustainable Supply Chains: A Summarised View of Current and
   Future Perspectives
SO OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR SUPPLY CHAINS
SE Lecture Notes in Logistics
AB Sustainable supply chain (SSC) research is recognised as being an emerging field where both academics and industry communities have an important role to play. At the organizations level, companies should not only be managed towards a profitability goal but also their contribution towards a sustainable society needs to be part of their decisions. For academic's sustainable supply chains although being an area that has been the focus of several studies is still far from being consensual. On the optimization of supply chains different perspectives have been adopted but much further has to be done. Along this chapter the concept of sustainable supply chains and some of the important publications in the area are analysed. A particular focus is given to the construction of tools based on optimization that may help the decision process in such systems while improving the efficiency and responsiveness of SSC. The chapter concludes with a recap of the published work while identifying key aspects that should be pursued so as to build optimized sustainable supply chains.

TI Energy-efficient terrace houses in Sweden - Simulations and measurements
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Reducing energy use in buildings is essential to decrease the environmental impact. Outside Gothenburg in Sweden, 20 terrace houses were built according to the passive house standard and completed in 2001. The goal was to show that it is possible to build passive houses in a Scandinavian climate with very low energy use and to normal costs. The houses are the result of a project including research, design, construction, monitoring and evaluation. The passive house standard means that the space heating peak load should not exceed 10 W/m(2) living area in order to use supply air heating. This requires low transmission and ventilation losses and the building envelope is therefore highly insulated and very airtight. A mechanical ventilation system with approximately 80% heat recovery is used. The electric resistance heating in the supply air is 900 W per living unit. Solar collectors on the roof provide 40% of the energy needed for the domestic hot water. The monitored delivered energy demand is 68 kWh/m(2) a. Energy simulations show that main differences between predicted and monitored energy performance concern the household electricity and the space heating demand. Total delivered energy is approximately 40% compared with normal standard in Sweden. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of phase change materials for improving thermal comfort in a
   super-insulated residential building
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The demand for high performance buildings is on the rise. As a result, several new building standards have emerged including the Passive House Standard, a rigorous energy-use standard based on a super-insulated and very tightly sealed building envelope. A common challenge with passive house designs is that they tend to overheat. This study explores the use of phase change materials (PCMs), which store heat as they melt and release heat as the solidify, to reduce the number of overheated hours and improve thermal comfort for a case study passive house duplex located in Portland, Oregon, USA.
   In this study, a newly constructed passive house duplex was thoroughly instrumented to monitor indoor environmental quality metrics and building energy use. One unit of the duplex was outfitted with 130 kg of PCM while the other unit served as a control. The performance of the PCM was evaluated through analysis of observed data and through additional computer simulation using an EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulation model validated with observed data. The study found that installation of the PCM had a positive effect on thermal comfort, reducing the estimated annual overheated hours from about 400 to 200. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB The indoor climate of the first passive house school in Norway was evaluated with the aid of a questionnaire (A-rebro) with approximately 340 respondents, and three interview rounds with a total of 23 informants. The intention was to reveal whether the users experienced any problems or possibly better conditions than in a regular school building. The interviews showed that, overall, the users were satisfied with the building. The survey showed generally good results for the indoor climate. Questionnaire results were compared with reference material consisting of data for average school buildings. The indoor climate of Marienlyst School was better than the average for most of the symptoms of indoor air quality problems, for both pupils and teachers. The users did still experience some problems with the building, relating to the fine-tuning of the automatic systems: temperature control, solar control, static electricity, and pressure conditions in the building. The users also said they lacked information about the passive house concept, the building, and how to obtain optimal functionality of the automatic control systems. The reasons for the fine-tuning problems are discussed in relation to the passive house concept, and the problem indicators are probably not attributable to the concept.

TI Towards Responsible and Sustainable Supply Chains - Innovation,
   Multi-stakeholder Approach and Governance
SO PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT
AB Supply chains are an indispensable element of any global economy. At the same time such supply chains create a societal and environmental burden. Drastic actions are required to mitigate these effects. Supply chains should become responsible and sustainable (where responsibility and sustainability are understood in a broad sense) addressing economic, political, societal, legal, human rights, ethical and environmental concerns. This research shifts from the question of why companies should implement responsibility and sustainability into supply chains, to how they should do so effectively. Illustrated by a case study of Sedex, a collaborative platform for buyers and suppliers, this paper proposes three solutions for responsible and sustainable supply chain management (SCM). Firstly, supply chains have to be supported by research and innovation (R&I). Secondly, supply chains should be based on multi-stakeholder efforts of industry, governmental and non-governmental organisations. Thirdly, the responsibility should lie not only with an individual company and its employees, but also with organisations of companies (supra-agency). As a result, responsible and sustainable supply chains require technological, political and ethical solutions involving the development of sound, multi-stakeholder business and governance models. These models should be based on the equal consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental and social), the cooperation of the partners in the chain, strengthening long-term relationships and legitimate requirements of the stakeholders of a supply chain.

TI Incorporating social aspects in sustainable supply chains: Trends and
   future directions
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The social dimension of sustainability in supply chains has grown in importance in both academic and industrial communities. This article aims to understand how social dimension has been incorporated in supply chain management research in the past years and what research gaps still exist. For this purpose, a systematic literature review is performed where 621 articles are analysed considering a set of categories that include: research methodology; social dimension; social analysis focus; supply chain entities; traceability and transparency; uncertainty and risk; industrial activity sector. A cross-analysis between categories is presented, revealing that social sustainability concerns have been increasingly addressed along the years, but further research still needs to be performed to achieve more inclusive social supply chains. N-Vivo Software is used to perform the content analysis. The main research gaps and trends regarding social concerns in supply chains are identified and systematised into a framework that can be used to integrate social aspects in supply chains. Based on the latter, a research agenda is defined targeting concerned researchers and practitioners to attain the sustainable supply chains. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Recurring controversies involving supply chain-related sustainability incidents suggest that firms with a global presence struggle to improve environmental, social and economic outcomes in global supply chains. Sustainable supply chain management has been suggested for improving sustainability outcomes in supply chains, yet global supply chains pose unique challenges. This paper aims to provide a synthesis of the key elements of sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains. To achieve this goal, we conduct a rigorous systematic literature review of articles focused on sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and apply structured content analysis to * mentioned articles spanning 15 years of research published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals. The research contributes by identifying configurations and governance mechanisms as key elements characterizing sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and synthesizing their relationship with sustainability outcomes. Overall configurations characterized by a greater connection between the focal firm and multi-tier suppliers, managed directly or through third parties, are increasing trends suggested to better serve sustainability development and offer several areas for future research. The research also contributes to practice by providing managers of focal firms with global supply chains directions for improving sustainable outcomes in their supply chains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although decentralized decision structures is more suitable for the general characteristics of supply chain management, the mechanism of coordination is affected by complex factors with multiple participate bodies and the multi-objective. Interest-risk mechanism and relationship mechanism are two main forces to promote coordination under decentralized decision structures. Interest-risk mechanism plays a fundamental role and can be divided into direct mechanisms and indirect mechanisms; Relationship mechanism established by specific asset investments is a necessary condition of supply chain coordination.

TI ANALYZING NEW WAYS TO ADAPT THE TRIPLE-A SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL AND ITS
   EXTENSIONS IN AGRI-FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS
SO LOGFORUM
AB Background: With the emergence of supply chain management as a key strategic function in the agri-food sector, a lot of research has been conducted to find ways to improve the performance and sustainability of agri-food supply chains. The Triple-A Supply Chain concept, which refers to the agility, adaptability, and alignment of the supply chains, has been a field of study for various researchers aiming at shaping meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages for businesses and organizations in various sectors. Over the years, alternative, complementary, or upgraded versions of this approach have been proposed, such as the "New AAA Supply Chain", which describes the renewed Triple -A Supply Chain model based on Super-Agility, Architectural Adaptability, and Ecosystem Alignment, and the "Triple A & R" framework, which refers to Agility for Robustness, Adaptability, and Resilience, and Re-Alignment. Methods: This paper presents the results of a selective study of the bibliography considering the Triple-A Supply Chain model, the "New AAA Supply Chain" model and the "Triple A & R" framework. These frameworks are analyzed and compared with each other considering their principles, and their implementation in the agri-food sector is researched. The scope of this study is to analyze the potential of the application and suitability of these frameworks in agri-food supply chains, having considered the particularities of the sector. Results: Examining the models concerning the evolution of the Triple-A Supply Chain paradigm, it is evident that they differ from each other, as they approach supply chain management from different viewpoints. Conclusions: The potential of application of various models originating from the Triple-A Supply Chain paradigm was examined in the case of the agri-food sector considering product nature, sustainability, and investment cost as the factors affecting it. These frameworks could partially find application in the agri-food sector, as some of their guidelines promote the increase of the agri-food supply chain effectiveness.

TI Application of data envelopment analysis models in supply chain
   management: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Supply chain management aims to designing, managing and coordinating material/product, information and financial flows to fulfill the customer requirements at low costs and thereby increasing supply chain profitability. In the last decades, data envelopment analysis has become the main topic of interest as a mathematical tool to evaluate supply chain management. While, various data envelopment analysis models have been suggested to measure and evaluate the supply chain management, there is a lack of research regarding to systematic literature review and classification of study in this field. Regarding this, some major databases including Web of Science and Scopus have been nominated and systematic and meta-analysis method which called "PRISMA" has been proposed. Accordingly, a review of 75 published articles appearing in 35 scholarly international journals and conferences between 1996 and 2016 have been attained to reach a comprehensive review of data envelopment analysis models in evaluation supply chain management. Consequently, the selected published articles have been categorized by author name, the year of publication, technique, application area, country, scope, data envelopment analysis purpose, study purpose, research gap and contribution, results and outcome, and journals and conferences in which they appeared. The results of this study indicated that areas of supplier selection, supply chain efficiency and sustainable supply chain have had the highest frequently than other areas. In addition, results of this review paper indicated that data envelopment analysis showed great promise to be a good evaluative tool for future evaluation on supply chain management, where the production function between the inputs and outputs was virtually absent or extremely difficult to acquire. The facility of multiple inputs and multiple outputs of the data envelopment analysis model was definitely an attractive one to most researchers and, therefore, the data envelopment analysis procedure had found many applications beyond supply chain management into organization and industry.

Using a theory-building approach, we develop a theory of socio-ecological intergradation to provide managers with guidance in mimicking natural ecosystems to develop more local and thus sustainable supply chains. Socio-ecological intergradation refers to the gradual merging of social (organizational) and ecological (environmental) systems to shift a firm's focus from global supply chain optimization to building more regionally bound, socio-ecologically connected operations. Drawing on the natural and industrial ecology literature, the paper identifies five principles that mimic natural ecosystems and increase the environmental sustainability of supply chains, including the ecological systems they ultimately depend on. The paper further illustrates what these principles mean in both an environmental and a supply chain context and how, in concert, they can lead toward more sustainably designed and managed supply chains. In building a theory of socio-ecological intergradation, this research is one of the first attempts to apply ecological principles to supply chains, creating synergy and dialogue between the sustainable supply chain management, business ethics, and industrial ecology disciplines.

AB In 2003, Louisiana State University's (LSU's) Office of Community Design and Development was awarded a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Outreach Partnership Center Community Futures Demonstration grant to investigate new prototypes for sustainable affordable housing. Following the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the focus of the grant was shifted to developing a homebuilding training program for New Orleans residents that resulted in the construction of the first two, new post-Hurricane Katrina houses in the Lower 9 neighborhood on the north side of the Lower 9th. A construction team of previously unskilled workers and 13 fourth-year students in the undergraduate professional degree program in architecture at LSU completed the work. This enterprise is discussed in the context of community participation, service learning, and the capital market for affordable housing in New Orleans at the time of the project. The demonstration project has not secured additional funding for continuation at this time; however, the process was deemed successful and the authors suggest six actions for replicating the program.

AB Container supply chain (CSC) is a specific type of supply chain with the rapid development of container transport and large-scale international trades. Under the backgrounds of financial crisis and green supply chain, time efficiency, cost efficiency and energy consumption are all important to build CSC with high quality. Time and cost are mainly pursued by the independent companies. Energy consumption minimization now is encouraged by the government and other organization. It is very important to build sustainable CSC. This study proposes a goal programming model to balance the three criteria with simulation study. The approach produces a significant result for global management of CSC for the industries and governments.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The growing concerns around sustainability along the supply chains are global. The complexity of supply chain sustainability becomes even more pronounced across the multiple tiers of organisations and networks and has imposed heavy pressures on organisations. Dealing with these pressures on society and the environment requires supply chains to lessen their socio-environmental impact. Multi-tier sustainable supply chains are a vehicle to aid in this important global goal. However, addressing these issues and concerns in the production processes and consumption of businesses and organisations is still in its early stages. In light of this, this Special Issue published in the International Journal of Production Research advances this important research agenda. Seventeen articles which were accepted for this Special Issue employed various methodologies/methods, theories, and contexts to respond to the need for research and provided valuable insights that address some of the pressing multi-tier supply chain sustainability problems. This Editorial provides an overview of these works, highlighting opportunities for future search directions.

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB For the last two decades, the topic of sustainable supply chains has evoked considerable interest from academics and practitioners. Within this context, Resources, Conservation and Recycling (RCR) and its two predecessors (Resources and Conservation, and Conservation and Recycling) have provided a platform for the exchange of technological, economic, institutional and policy aspects to help societies transition toward sustainability. The current article analyses the published research works in the RCR literature within the context of sustainable supply chain modeling by employing a content analysis literature review technique. Using the body of available literature in RCR, the articles on sustainable supply chain are analyzed in terms of the following: (1) publication per year, (2) top-cited papers across time, (3) most productive and influential authors, institutions and countries (4) supply chain related topical themes, (5) research methodologies applied, (6) illustration types and (7) industries addressed. The analysis revealed that the call for incorporating sustainability (i.e., economic, social, and environmental pillars) into supply chain operations has increased in recent years in RCR publications. Finally, the comprehensive findings and interpretations are presented, as well as the primary current trends, future challenges, directions and opportunities.

AB Developed countries, led by the United States and the European Union, have stepped up security review of supply chains and adopted a series of restrictive policies and protectionist measures to reshape a more secure, sustainable, and risk-controllable supply chain. A key objective of the West's supply chain strategy is to wean their economies off Chinese influence by resorting to discriminatory policies. Supply chain interventionism on national security grounds violates market rules on which the global supply chain is based, and also runs counter to the principles of nondiscrimination and liberalization embedded in the multilateral trade governance architecture. Global supply chain reshuffles will take time and incur huge costs, leaving ample room for Beijing to make necessary adjustments and bolster its position in global supply networks.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The importance of supply chain innovation to the operational management practices is difficult to underestimate, especially as it concerns developing novel products and services or the use of digital technologies. Supply chain innovation is imperative for enhancing supply chain performance and gaining sustainable competitive advantages. Despite rapidly growing academic interest and significant relevance to industry practitioners, the supply chain innovation research field appears to be highly fragmented. The field could benefit from a better common understanding of the elements comprising innovation management practices among the supply chain actors. Our objective is to structure and analyze literature on the topic of the overlapping subject areas of supply chain management and innovation management. We conduct a systematic bibliometric analysis of 230 articles published in 52 journals from 1997 to 2021. Using the integrated network analysis methodology, we identify and interpret 12 thematic research clusters such as green supply chain innovation, knowledge management and collaboration, and supply chain integration. These topics are salient in the current supply chain innovation literature and reflect modern trends towards eco-innovation, digitalization, and long-term collaboration in supply chain business practices. Considering the identified clusters, we conduct a content analysis and develop a supply chain innovation matrix linking operational and management practices to innovation outcomes. The matrix systematically structures supply chain innovation processes and can be used by industry professionals to effectively design supply chain innovation strategies and determine the impacts of adopted practices on innovation performance.

TI How to evaluate sustainability of supply chains? A dynamic network DEA
   approach
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel network and dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) model for evaluating sustainability of supply chains. In the proposed model, all links can be considered in calculation of efficiency score.
   Design/methodology/approach - A dynamic DEA model to evaluate sustainable supply chains in which networks have series structure is proposed. Nature of free links is defined and subsequently applied in calculating relative efficiency of supply chains. An additive network DEA model is developed to evaluate sustainability of supply chains in several periods. A case study demonstrates applicability of proposed approach.
   Findings - This paper assists managers to identify inefficient supply chains and take proper remedial actions for performance optimization. Besides, overall efficiency scores of supply chains have less fluctuation. By utilizing the proposed model and determining dual-role factors, managers can plan their supply chains properly and more accurately.
   Research limitations/implications - In real world, managers face with big data. Therefore, we need to develop an approach to deal with big data.
   Practical implications - The proposed model offers useful managerial implications along with means for managers to monitor and measure efficiency of their production processes. The proposed model can be applied in real world problems in which decision makers are faced with multi-stage processes such as supply chains, production systems, etc.
   Originality/value - For the first time, the authors present additive model of network-dynamic DEA. For the first time, the authors outline the links in a way that carry-overs of networks are connected in different periods and not in different stages.

AB Organizations of the 21st century can no longer limit themselves to producing and marketing products or services without any concerns for the impact they have on society. If they want to be trusted by their customers, employees and the public at large, they have to be more socially responsible. The article deals with the possibilities and applying the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in a supply chain context in the process of globalization. Corporate social responsibility is an impulse and a mean to discuss the extent of any obligations of the organization towards its immediate environment. With increased globalization and offshore sourcing, global supply chain management is becoming an important issue for many businesses. Supply chain management is an area with increasing of strategic importance due to global competition, outsourcing of noncore activities to developing countries, short product life cycle, and time compression in all aspects of the supply chain. Management attention has moved from competition between firms to competition between supply chains. The capability to establish close and long-term relationships with suppliers and other strategic partners has become a crucial factor in creating competitive advantage. The aim of the article is to focus attention on the most important application area of corporate social responsibility within an integrated supply chain.

TI An analysis on housing affordability in Malaysian housing markets and
   the home buyers' preference
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the housing preference and housing affordability in Malaysian housing markets. There is a lack of research on the gap between supply and demand of houses in this market. Urbanization has increased the demand of houses in urban areas. However, the high demand in residential units increases the housing price which causes the affordability level dropped. Besides, the residences that provided by developers do not meet the expectation of the home buyers. There are three attributes that examined in this research to understand the home buyers' preference.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper provides quantitative analysis on the housing affordability and the home buyers' preference. This paper presents the results on the home buyers' housing affordability and buying preference on houses. In addition, the study further confirmed the significant relationship between monthly income and type of preferred house, as well as monthly income and range of housing affordability using cross-tabulation analysis.
   Findings
   The findings indicated that the housing price in the current market is not affordable by most of the homebuyers and there are certain attributes that important to home buyers which should not be neglected.
   Research limitations/implications
   This paper helps to shed light on the planning of Malaysian housing policy especially on the issue of providing affordable housing in urban areas.
   Practical implications
   Policymakers shall consider the elements of economics, social acceptance and feasibility of Malaysian housing policies to achieve sustainability in Malaysian housing markets. With the current government's move to promote housing affordability amongst B40 income groups, local government and housing developers should work together in addressing housing demand in accordance to states and ensure that there is a more targeted housing policy.
   Social implications
   With the detailed analysis on the home buyers' preference, it helps to promote sustainable housing developments in meeting basic housing needs and preference.
   Originality/value
   This is the first study to examine relationship between Malaysian housing affordability with monthly income and type of preferred house. In the meantime, the housing affordability is compared with mean housing price and type of perceived affordable house. The paper presented homebuyer's preference in housing for the consideration of government and housing developers in providing affordable housing.

TI Impacts of social distancing measures on global supply chain
   configuration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB World Health Organisation has advised governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by introducing stringent social distancing measures (SDMs) in five levels, ranging from pandemic surveillance, stay-at-home recommendations, workplace closures, to national and international travel restrictions. These measures inevitably disrupt global business environment and supply chain configuration. Existing literature does not comprehensively analyze the five-level SDMs' impacts on firms and supply chains. Thus, we established a mixed-integer programming model to integrate environment changes in lead time and cost for transportation and processing, market size, and the number of countries (NoC) imposing the SDMs. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate propagation impacts on global supply chains when the SDMs are imposed on firms in different echelons of supply chains. Results show that (i) supply chain losses and disruptions primarily depend on the NoC, followed by restricted transportation, market size, and processing limitations. (ii) When the SDMs, especially restrictions on transportation, are implemented in downstream echelons, the propagation impacts on supply chains and firms become more significant. (iii) Compared with elastic-demand supply chains, the fixed-demand one, e.g. food supply chain, suffers more significantly with the stringent SDMs and high holding costs. Finally, managerial implications are discussed from supply chains, firms, and policymakers.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB To achieve sustainable development and cope with growing socioenvironmental pressure, manufacturing com-panies are becoming increasingly committed to fulfilling their social responsibilities along the entire supply chain. However, it is still unclear whether fulfilling supply chain social responsibility can improve sustainable performance. On the basis of stakeholder theory and using structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study explores the complex relationship between supply chain social responsibility and sustainable performance using data collected from 209 Chinese manufacturing com-panies. The SEM findings show that supply chain social responsibility can improve sustainable performance, while the fsQCA results suggest that the impact of supply chain social responsibility on sustainable performance depends on fulfillment methods. In particular, three supply chain social responsibility patterns can help achieve highly sustainable performance. However, these patterns significantly impact economic, environmental, and social performance in different ways. Our empirical study provides theoretical and practical guidance for companies to fulfill their supply chain social responsibilities.

TI Operational performance evaluation of a Passive house residential
   building in northern China based on long-term monitoring in winter
SO INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Passive houses, called nearly zero energy buildings in China, are developing rapidly. These constructions in China are mainly located in cold climate zones. Due to highly efficient energy-saving technology, Passive houses can decrease space heating demand (SHD) by 70%-90% compared to local conventional buildings. However, this energy-saving rate is still a theoretical result and needs to be verified by real data. There is a lack of studies evaluating the performance of residential Passive houses through monitored data in China. This article selects a newly built multi-storey residential Passive house building in Qingdao to accurately quantify its energy performance. Through energy consumption monitoring throughout winter, the average SHD of this building at an occupancy rate of 47% was found to be 28 kWh/(m(2)center dot a) and the primary energy consumption was 96.7 kWh/(m(2)center dot a), while maintaining a high level of indoor comfort. Compared with local conventional Green Buildings, the SHD of the case building was reduced by 86.3% and the total energy consumption was reduced by 69.2%. The results demonstrate that Passive houses have a great energy-saving potential and provide evidence supporting the use of Passive houses as an option for sustainable building in northern China.

TI Modeling a low-carbon garment supply chain
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB This article attempts to introduce indirect carbon emission and trade-credit concept in a network optimisation model for sustainable supply chain. The proposed model optimises total cost, total direct carbon emission, total indirect emission in the form of embodied carbon footprint of the raw material and total trade-credit amount over the purchased item in a supply chain. The model calculates the total cost by considering purchasing cost, logistics cost, handling cost and manufacturing cost. It attempts to measure the direct emission involved in manufacturing and logistics operations. The model has the capability to consider dissimilar trucks used for transportation according to their operating cost and carbon emission. Multi-objective goal programming is applied to deal with four objectives to find a tradeoff among these objectives. The result suggests that managers should capture the direct as well as the indirect emission which helps in arriving at appropriate strategy for a sustainable supply chain. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case of a garment supply chain. This model also supports in deciding appropriate goal for carbon emission, supply chain costs, etc.

TI PRICE TRANSMISSION IN MILK SUPPLY CHAIN IN UKRAINE
SO AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC E-JOURNAL
AB Purpose. The purpose of the study, which results are submitted in the article, is to analyze the vertical price transmission along the milk supply chain in Ukraine and identify whether this price transmission is symmetric or asymmetric in terms of direction, magnitude, speed.
   Methodology / approach. To achieve the purpose of the study, we used the following research methods: logical operations (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction) - to determine the structure of the milk supply chain, to make conclusions about main findings; the correlation analysis - to identify the tightness of links between farm', processors' and retailers' prices, the trend modelling to build the functions of the trend of prices of different levels of the milk supply chain, the regression modelling - to construct the regression functions of prices of downstream sectors of the milk supply chain, graphic - for visual presentation of main tendencies, pricing and price dynamics in the milk supply chain. The research was performed on the basis of the statistical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine for 2013-2020.
   Results. This paper presents the empirical evidence of asymmetric price transmission along the milk supply chain in Ukraine. The results of modelling proved asymmetric magnitudes of price growth at the organizational and technological stages of the milk supply chain: in the case of the farm prices of raw milk increase the processors' and retailers' prices grow up by a much bigger magnitude. There is no leg in price transmission in the milk supply chain, the price shocks at the farm level instantly pass to processors' and retailers' prices. The evidence of asymmetry of price transmission testifies the weaknesses of the market positions of farmers and consumers in the milk supply chain in Ukraine, points out the threats for the food security and sustainable development of all agents of this chain.
   Originality / scientific novelty. For the first time, the quantitative assessments of the magnitude and speed of the price changes in the process of price transmission in the milk supply chain in Ukraine were obtained. The asymmetry of the magnitudes of the vertical price transmission in the milk supply chain in Ukraine was identified. The hostage position of farmers in the case of price shocks was further proved.
   Practical value / implications. This paper provides a better understanding of arrangements of market forces in the milk supply chain, the consequences of price chocks in the upstream sector of the milk supply chain. The practical value is the methodological and empirical support for the development of regulative measures to improve the milk supply chain's functioning and sustain food security. Assessment and analysis of the mechanism of price transmission reveals the weak parts of the food supply chain, contributing to the scientific foundation of elaborating the necessary policy actions for harmonization of relations between producers of different stages of the milk chain.

TI Managing micro and small enterprise supply chains: A multi-level
   approach to sustainability, resilience and regional development
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Amidst the high number of frameworks associated with supply chain sustainability (SCS), proper consideration to the role and importance of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) has been missing in the literature. To address this research gap, this paper investigates the driving factors that support MSE supply chains to achieve sustainability. We employ institutional and complexity theories to broaden our understanding of the dynamics behind neglected supply chain structures, especially the ones predominantly formed by MSEs. An in-depth nested case study is carried out in a MSE supply chain in an emerging economy, where 33 supply chain players were involved in the data collection. Using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to analyze the data, we find that to truly implement SCS, research and practice should consider not only the strategic, structural and process levels, but also the contextual level, which is critical dimension to SCS dynamics. Results show that MSE supply chains contribute significantly to regional socio-economic development due to their local roots and regional history. Also, findings demonstrate that MSE supply chains have enhanced resilience to crises (e.g., economic, political and other disruptions) because they are often focused on long-standing economic activities within the regional ecosystems. This paper contributes to theory by arguing that SCS is a much more complex phenomenon in practice than the current theory implies. Therefore, incorporating the diversity from reality and the peculiarities of MSE supply chains into the SCS debate helps the literature to get closer to the SCS practice.

TI Is urbanisation in South Africa on a sustainable trajectory?
SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Urbanisation is an important but contested process because of its far-reaching social, economic and environmental implications. The paper explores the relationship between urbanisation and living conditions in South Africa over the last decade. The central question addressed is whether population growth in the main cities has been accompanied by improved living standards, housing and public services. One finding is that employment growth has tended to coincide with demographic trends, which is necessary to reduce poverty. In addition, the provision of urban infrastructure has outstripped population growth, resulting in better access to essential services and reduced backlogs. In contrast, the provision of affordable housing has not kept pace with household growth, so more people than ever are living in shacks. A more comprehensive assessment is required before one can be sure that urbanisation is on a sustainable trajectory.

SO GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB This study analyzes and investigates factors influencing the export of industrial sectors of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries. These factors can clarify whether the industrial sector of GMS countries that are involved in international trade can reach or be linked to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) under the United Nations (UN). The data used in this study is the firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey. Results from a Tobit model indicate that firm size, access to finance, license from foreign firm, research and development, website availability and skilled labour are important factors contributing to the export participation of the industrial sector of GMS countries. Policies are warranted to help support the industrial sector of GMS countries to achieve SDGs. These policy measures are easier access to financial services, access to skilled workforce, training of entrepreneurs, applying research and development, encouraging foreign investment for operational synergies and export incentives for penetration in the global market.

TI A systematic literature review of modern slavery through benchmarking
   global supply chain
SO BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The globalisation of supply chains has contributed to modern slavery by degrading labour standards and work practices. The inherent difficulties involved in monitoring extremely fragmented production processes also render workers in and from developing countries vulnerable to labour exploitation. This research adopts a benchmark methodology that will help examine the inherent modern slavery challenges.Design/methodology/approach- This study examines how the benchmark model, including governance, risk assessment, purchasing practice, recruitment and remedy of victims, addresses supply chain modern slavery challenges. The proposed hypotheses are tested based on the reoccurring issues of modern slavery in global supply chains.Findings - Estimations suggest that modern slavery is a growing and increasingly prominent international problem, indicating that it is the second largest and fastest growing criminal enterprise worldwide except for narcotics trafficking. These social issues in global supply chains have drawn attention to the importance of verifying, monitoring and mapping supply chains, especially in lengthy and complex supply chains. However, the advent of digital technologies and benchmarking methodologies has become one of the existing key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring the effectiveness of modern slavery initiatives in supply chains.Originality/value - This review provides an understanding of the current situation of global supply chains concerning the growing social issue of modern slavery. However, this includes various individual specialities relating to global supply chains, modern slavery, socially sustainable supply chain management (SCM), logistic social responsibility, corporate social responsibility and digitalisation. Furthermore, the review provided important implications for researchers examining the activities on benchmarking the effectiveness of the existing initiatives to prevent modern slavery in the supply chains.

To bridge the three circular supply chain reverse processes (i.e., recycle, redistribute, remanufacture) and the three factors affecting blockchain technologies (i.e., trust, traceability, transparency), this paper proposes the integrated Triple Retry framework for designing circular blockchain platforms. A circular blockchain platform was designed in a supply chain, including manufacturer, reverse logistics service provider, selection centre, recycling centre, and landfill. The results highlight blockchain's role as a technological capability for improving control in the movement of wastes and product return management activities.

This article addresses this directly, offering empirical evidence indicating that sustainable supply chain management practices result in more favorable consumer brand evaluations and increased purchase intentions. This effect is operationalized through consumers' self-brand connections and cognitive dissonance such that sustainable supply chain management simultaneously increases connections between individuals and the brand but decreases the psychological discomfort associated with cognitive dissonance.

TI Warranty Period Decision and Coordination in Closed-Loop Supply Chains
   Considering Remanufacturing and Consumer Behavior
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The closed-loop supply chain management model is an effective way to promote sustainable economic development and environmental protection. Increasing the sales volume of remanufactured products to stimulate green growth is a key issue in the development of closed-loop supply chains. By designing an effective warranty strategy, customer's perceived value can be enhanced and market demand can be stimulated. This study cuts through the warranty period of closed-loop supply chain products. Based on the perspective of consumer behavior, game theory is used to construct the optimal decision-making model for closed-loop supply chains. The optimal warranty decision making for new products and remanufactured products under centralized and decentralized decision-making models is discussed. Further, the impact of the closed-loop supply chain system with warranty services and the design of contract coordination is also shown. We show that consumer preference has a positive impact on the sales of remanufactured products and the profits of enterprises; with the extension of the new product and remanufacturing warranty period, the profit of the supply chain system first increases and then decreases, and the value is maximized at the extreme point in the manufacturer-led decision-making model. Furthermore, the leader gains higher profits with bargaining power, but the profit of the supply chain system under decentralized decision model is less than that of the centralized decision model, reflecting the double marginalization effect. The revenue sharing contract and the two-charge contract designed in this study coordinate the closed-loop supply chain system with warranty services, so that the member companies in the supply chain can achieve Pareto improvement.

TI Energy-constrained and low-carbon scenarios for the transportation and
   logistics industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - There is consensus among experts that the design of future supply chains will have to focus more strongly on environmental concerns. Sustainability will play a major role within the business and has an impact especially on the distant future. Thus, supply chain executives are challenged in designing sustainable supply chains for the future. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop expert-based scenarios, which describe how future supply chains could evolve by 2030. The authors focus on the transportation and logistics industry's perspective to provide an industry-internal view. The data collection is based on an internet-based Delphi survey. Overall, 48 top executives from 20 countries, representing academic, governmental, and industrial perspectives, participated in the survey.
   Findings - The authors operationalized the research question into five concrete sub-topics relevant for investigation: energy and emissions, consumer behaviour, future transport modes, design of future supply chains, and innovation. The authors derive five Delphi-based scenarios defined by clusters of their impact and expected probability: measurement and control of CO2-emissions; integrated low energy logistics systems; business-as-usual logistics; no-frills logistics and alternative fuels. Each cluster contributes differently to supply chain strategy.
   Originality/value - The authors address the major issues and challenges experts expect regarding future supply chains in an energy-constrained, low-carbon world. Five scenario clusters evolved for supply chain strategy development. Finally, the authors make recommendations towards strategic planning in the transportation and logistics industry.

TI Sustainable supply chain flexibility and its relationship to circular
   economy-target performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The circular economy (CE) is an evolving economic and sustainable development model. In this new environment, companies face a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex market environment. These challenges arise from material closed-loop flows necessary for a functioning CE. It is important to build flexibility capabilities into sustainable supply chains to address CE operational challenges. Building this operational capability needs to occur without incurring performance degradation, increasing costs, or compromising product quality. Supply chain designers have recognised the importance of sustainable supply chain flexibility (SSCF) efforts for meeting CE-targeted performance. CE-targeted performance includes reuse of materials and energy, closed flow of materials, and pollution reduction. Exploration of relationships between SSCF efforts and CE-targeted performance is limited. An objective-DEMATEL method is used to evaluate the relationship between a new SSCF measures framework and CE-targeted performance. A field study helps to identify and refine significant SSCF measures (efforts) to effectively improve CE-targeted performance. Managerial implications and future research directions for sustainable supply chain flexibility within the CE environment are presented.

TI What Does Not Kill You Makes You Stronger: Supply Chain Resilience and
   Corporate Sustainability Through Emerging IT Capability
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Global epidemics and international conflicts disrupt supply chain operations. Many enterprises employ emerging information technology (IT) to reduce supply chain vulnerability and enhance supply chain resilience. Technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain facilitate more robust supply chain operations, such as remanufacturing, just-in-time production, and automated workflow, leading to corporate sustainability along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. From a dynamic capability perspective, this article conceptualizes emerging IT capability and investigates its role in helping enterprises survive supply chain disruptions and prosper in the long run. A research model depicts the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain vulnerability vigilance, emerging IT capability, supply chain resilience, and corporate sustainability. A partial least square analysis on survey observations collected from more than 200 enterprises in China that are highly susceptible to supply chain disruptions provides supporting evidence to most research hypotheses. The results show that high vigilance to potential supply chain disruptions will motivate enterprises to develop emerging IT capability, which will enhance supply chain resilience as well as economic, environmental, and social performances. The mediating role of emerging IT capability suggests a viable path for enterprises to adapt to the increasingly turbulent environment and improve supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability.

AB Collaboration among supply chain partners is essential to enhance environmental performance during the life cycle of a product. Inter-organizational measures for green supply chain management tend to show diverse patterns because of various requirements that emerge in a complex supply chain. However, this diversity hampers the comprehensive understanding and systematic adoption of these measures. Therefore, this paper classifies various inter-organizational measures for green supply chain management into several collaboration patterns and analyzes their structural relations through an interpretive structural modeling. The results reveal the collaboration patterns that have higher driving power and dependency than other patterns and, thus, require further attentions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI An intelligent method for supply chain finance selection using supplier
   segmentation: A payment risk portfolio approach
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB The COVID-19 pandemic-driven financial crisis grew significant interest among firms to adopt supply chain finance (SCF) to optimize working capital for the financial stability of the supply chain. However, it is impractical for firms with a diverse and extensive supplier base to strategize the SCF solutions for individual suppliers by assessing their financial risk. Hence, this study conceptualizes an intelligent method to demonstrate how supplier segmentation based on suppliers' payment risk portfolios helps supply chain practitioners to assess suppliers' financial risk and strategize manageable supply chain finance solutions for them. This method employs a stochastic optimization model to compute suppliers' optimum payment risk portfolios and generate a supplier segmentation matrix to offer supply chain practitioners the cognitive ability to select appropriate SCF solutions for their suppliers. The proposed method can be implemented into an AI-driven explainable recommendation system to aid supply chain practitioners in applying smart strategic thinking in supply chain finance decision-making.

TI The interplay of emerging technologies in pharmaceutical supply chain
   performance: An empirical investigation for the rise of Pharma 4.0
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The impact and the relevance of the emerging technologies on the supply chains have attracted researchers and practitioners alike worldwide. Based on the resource-based view and organizational information processing theory, this study attempts to investigate how emerging technologies influence supply chain performance, particularly pharmaceutical supply chain in regards to the rise of Pharma 4.0. The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers. This study thereby empirically investigates the interplay between emerging technologies in pharmaceutical supply chain performance and provides managerial insights with a proposed research framework on how to incorporate and encourage Pharma 4.0 for achieving sustainability in the supply chains.

TI A Green Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design Model
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Environmental considerations have become a significant issue in the design of supply chain networks due to today's increasing globalization trends. Therefore, supply chain network design needs to be managed in an efficient way to deal with the complex networks involved. The aim of this article is to present a multi-objective optimization model for a green dual-channel supply chain network that handles economic and environmental objectives to optimize network flow. A complex mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) has been proposed in a green dual-channel and closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design. The main objective of the generated MILP model is to investigate the optimal selection of echelons and the optimal selection of transportation alternatives between these echelons in a CLSC network that includes an e-commerce channel structure based on economic and environmental considerations. Environmental aims are achieved by decreasing CO2 emissions and by reducing PM (particulate matter) concentration throughout the network. In addition, economic aims are also met by minimizing the overall cost. The validity of the presented model is supported by a case study in the home appliances industry. The results indicate that this model provides valuable knowledge and various alternatives to managers and policymakers depending on the different weight combinations.

AB The impact of COVID-19 caused a crash in the supply chain across almost all manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers and now dramatically impacts many of the processes in the manufacturing sectors. In particular, the steel industry, as an energy-intensive industry, is being urged to adopt digitalisation technology to achieve optimization and sustainable production. Industries are fortunate to showcase an opportunity to advance the supply chain towards sustainability to deal with such a crisis. It is acknowledged that digital technology like blockchain can provide intercession by discovering real-time problems to perform certain Sustainable Development Goals related to procurement, production and processing, logistics and transportation and the environment. However, the data structure which requires implementation by blockchain technology in the steel supply chain is restricted. Blockchain technology has the outstanding position to transform the supply chain. The main challenge is that tracing border activities in the steel supply chain has not well been monitored. The digital system is drastically required to develop advanced technology to handle the disruptions and build a resilient supply chain. Using blockchain technology can capture the goods movement across the entire supply chain to verify the quality and product provenance. Furthermore, the rapid technology innovation in the steel sector involves the continuous update of skills and personnel. This study aims to explore the role of blockchain technology in the steel supply chain industry, such as inter-organizational trust, data transparency and immutability, interoperability and product type, and social influence and behavioural intention. A qualitative research approach was adopted on exploring multiple-case studies. The study reveals that blockchain technology contributes to a resilient steel supply chain in reducing risks and uncertainties with its transparency and immutability function. In the future, an integrated technology implementation framework should be developed to deploy Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology in manufacturing industries to accelerate the digital transformation.

   Resilience and Performance: An Empirical Analysis on an Emerging Market
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The global supply chain has suffered an unprecedented impact Affected by multiple factors such as anti-globalization, rising trade protectionism and the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the technology-organization-environment framework and resource-based theory, this study attempts to explore and analyze what drives a firm's willingness to adopt artificial intelligence technology and how such willingess to adopt artificial intelligence technology may contribute to supply chain resilience and supply chain performance. Using survey data collected from 318 firms in China, we empirically test our arguments and hypotheses through the structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that the relative advantages of enterprise artificial intelligence technology, supply chain collaboration, and environmental uncertainty are the three major factors affecting the adoption of artificial intelligence technology, which subsequently provide a positive impact on supply chain resilience and supply chain performance. This study expands the application field and scope of artificial intelligence technology, fills the relatively large gap in the research on the behavior of enterprise users adopting artificial intelligence technology in the supply chain field. This provides a useful reference for enterprises to adopt artificial intelligence technology.

TI Improving Physical Activity among Residents of Affordable Housing: Is
   Active Design Enough?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Physical inactivity increases risk of chronic disease. Few studies examine how built environment interventions increase physical activity (PA). Active design (AD) utilizes strategies in affordable housing to improve resident health. We assessed how AD housing affects PA among low-income families in Brooklyn, New York. Participants were recruited at lease signings in 2016 from a new AD apartment complex and two recently renovated comparison buildings without AD features. Eligibility included age 18 years with no contraindications to exercise. Anthropometric data were collected. PA was self-reported using the Recent and Global Physical Activity Questionnaires. Smartphone users shared their tracked step. Data collection was repeated one year after move-in. All data were analyzed using SPSS. Eighty-eight eligible participants completed the initial questionnaire (36 AD and 52 from 2 comparison buildings) at baseline (T0). There were no differences between AD and comparison cohorts in: stair use, PA, sitting time or, mean waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) at T0. However, the AD cohort had a lower baseline BMI (27.6 vs. 31.0, p = 0.019). At one-year follow-up (T1), 75 participants completed our survey including a 64% retention rate among those who previously completed the T0 questionnaire. Among T0 questionnaire respondents, mean daily steps increased at T1 among AD participants who moved from an elevator building (6782, p = 0.051) and in the comparison group (2960, p = 0.023). Aggregate moderate work-related activity was higher at T1 in the AD building (746 vs. 401, p = 0.031). AD building women reported more work-related PA overall but AD men engaged in more moderate recreational PA. Living in an AD building can enhance low-income residents' PA. More research with objective measures is needed to identify strategies to sustain higher PA levels and overall health.

TI A systematic review of China's belt and road initiative: implications
   for global supply chain management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is one of the world's largest infrastructure projects, with its potential political and economic impact being widely discussed since its inception in 2013. Yet the phenomenon has received only limited attention in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) literature. In response, we first conduct a broad systematic review of the literature to assess how China's BRI is portrayed. Using this as a backdrop, we then distil the likely impact of the BRI on location decisions and supply chain flows. Finally, in a broader discussion of the SCM literature, we explore the implications of the BRI for future research in four key areas: supply chain configuration, supply chain resilience, sustainable SCM, and cross border SCM. While these areas are not new, the BRI presents a unique context that can be used to enhance theory and understanding in each area. The BRI reduces time distance independent of geographical distance by diverting supply chain flows from established routes to new routes via far less accessible regions. This introduces new risks and sustainability issues that call for multi-criteria decision support systems. Another important issue is the adoption and diffusion of the BRI since this will ultimately determine project success.

AB Using the resource-based view theory, this paper explores the association between green human resource management and green supply chain management. Moreover, the collective impact of green human resource management and green supply chain management on the triple bottom lines (social, environmental, and economic performance) was tested. The current study employed a random sampling technique in evaluating data from 212 firms from the chemical, pharmaceutical, automotive, textile, and food industries. Our main findings include the following. First, green human resource management positively influenced the triple bottom lines. Second, green supply chain management mediates green human resource management and triple bottom lines. Specifically, internal green supply chain management mediates green human resource management practices and sustainable performance. In contrast, external green supply chain management practices only mediate the relationship between green human resource management practices and the environmental and social perspective of sustainable performance. The study provides managerial implications and future recommendations.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Supply chain requires simultaneous enhancement of the economic, environmental, and social performance of the business toward sustainability. For this aim, a sustainable performance assessment system is needed to be implemented for evaluating different supply chain segments and clarify supply chains' indicators. The assessment can be performed based on three sustainability dimensions: economical, environmental, and social. The first purpose of this paper helps to identify sustainability issues and highlights the gaps and inconsistencies of literature. The second purpose of the study is to identify the most important indicators of sustainability for sustainable development supply chain of Iranian Oil Company stakeholder engagement. The indicators of the sustainable supply chain are studied and collected using metasynthesis approach, and the most important indicators of sustainability were identified for the company with Delphi technique. The proposed sustainability indicators can be useful for the researchers to develop practical and comprehensive measures in their respective industries.

TI Optimizing firm's supply chain resilience in data-driven business
   environment
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB Purpose This study aims to investigate the impact of a firm's supply chain capabilities on supply chain resilience, and the impact of supply chain resilience on sustainable supply chain performance in a data-driven business environment. The study also aims to explore the function of supply chain resilience in mediating the relationship between a firm's supply chain capability and sustainable supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach Primary data were acquired through a survey of 310 managers of small- and medium-sized businesses in a variety of industries across Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings A firm's supply chain capabilities include information technology, leadership and collaboration. Supply chain capability is positively associated with supply chain resilience. The resilience of a firm's supply chain is also positively correlated with its sustainable supply chain performance. Supply chain resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between a firm's supply chain capabilities and its sustainable supply chain performance. Research limitations/implications This study provides a theoretical contribution by corroborating practical knowledge focusing on firms' supply chain capability, supply chain resilience and sustainable supply chain performance by using a resource-based view and dynamic capability theory - a relevant and unexplored subject in the supply chain literature - and proposes several opportunities for future research. Practical implications The results highlight the study's managerial and social relevance from the perspective of firms in developing countries. As firms shift toward an online environment, managers and decision-makers need to make strategic decisions, as they did to overcome the challenges presented by COVID-19. Originality/value The study's findings demonstrate that firms' supply chain capabilities can be leveraged to increase supply chain resilience. Firms' resilience during COVID-19 allowed them to avoid losses and to improve their supply chain's sustainable performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, their complex higher order model is a unique contribution to the literature on firms' supply chain capability and extends previous research on this topic.

AB Fourth Party Logistics is the next generation of supply chain. outsourcing. Supply chain activities are information-rich, complex and increasingly global. At the same time, technology and Enabled capabilities are racing ahead. To enable a firm to capture all the benefits of supply chain collaboration and synchronization, a new generation of integration must be deployed, which is currently beyond the capabilities of traditional sourcing methods. The paper illustrates that a 4PL arrangement has the potential to provide your organization with breakthrough supply chain performance. It is distinct from current approaches to supply chain outsourcing, because it delivers measurable, sustainable value across the full breadth of the supply chain. Getting into this relationship with a 4PL begins a journey in which you and the 4PL will come together to create an evolving, mutually beneficial, long-term relationship.

AB The future belongs to the smart factor, and only after perfectly integrated logistics processes create the necessary preconditions. Talking about electricity, we find that on one hand the electricians create the Smart Grid, while on the other hand the logisticians present the Smart Supply chain, two concepts that integrate by two different ways, the intelligence to the electricity management. In this work, we create a reconciliation between the two concepts, by first comparing the classical electricity supply chain, the electricity supply chain based on a smart grid, and the smart supply chain as seen by the industrialists. We focus on one side of the smart supply chain namely "interconnectivity", and we provide a set of indicators to evaluate the proposed supply chain.

AB Industrialized Building System (IBS) is usually associated with sustainable construction which is described as the ability of the construction system to consider the environmental impact of a building over its entire lifetime, while optimizing its economic viability and the comfort and safety of its occupants. Typical standard building practices are guided by short term economic considerations. Affordable construction is based on best practices which emphasize long term affordability, quality and efficiency. The needs of affordable housing in Indonesia is very crucial every year. Housing needs continue to rise very rapidly in Indonesia, particularly in urban areas. Back log housing up to 2016 has reached up to 7.6 million units, while demand for new homes every year reached up to 800,000 units. There are about 1,350,000 units' gap that must be resolved in order to fulfill the housing need in Indonesia. One of the ways to speed up the construction of these affordable housing is to use IBS in construction. IBS is defined as a construction system which components are manufactured in a factory, on or off site, positioned and assembled into structure with minimum additional site work. The main goals of IBS construction are to meet present day needs for housing, working environments and infrastructure without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in times to come. To achieve the objective of this paper a methodology is identify, which include: literature review; expert opinions; and data collection by using interview. It was found that the use of interlocking brick system was able to achieve saving in labour cost up to 50% and the overall cost saving can be up to 33.8%. It is hoped that by introducing this system, the way forward to meet the demand of housing industry in Indonesia can be fulfilled and achieved.

AB The need for environmental protection and increasing demands for natural resources are forcing companies to reconsider their business models and restructure their supply chain operations. Scholars and proactive companies have begun to create more sustainable supply chains. What has not been fully addressed is how organizations deal with short-term pressures to remain economically viable while implementing these newly modeled supply chains. In this study, we use theory-building through case studies to answer the question: how do organizations balance short-term profitability and long-term environmental sustainability when making supply chain decisions under conditions of uncertainty? We present five sets of propositions that explain how exemplars in green supply chain management make decisions and balance short and long term objectives. We also identify four environmental postures that help explain the decisions organizations make when dealing with strategic trade-offs among the economic, environmental and social elements of the triple-bottom-line.

AB Global supply chains shift to meet exceeding expectations in supply chains lead to the need for digital technologies in supply chain management. Industry 4.0 has emerged in sustainable supply chain systems, blockchain is prominent, with the potential of immutable transparent data. Blockchains present potential to disrupt supply chains through digital transformation by enabling provenance, visibility, relationships, collaboration, lower costs, and enabling real-time trusted data. Scholars are increasingly investigating blockchain adoption, with an emphasis on technology acceptance modelling. Current research is valuable to understand potentials of blockchain technology in supply chains however, there is limited work on the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of supply chains. This study aims to investigate through a systematic literature review and case studies, the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of sustainable supply chains. Blockchain adoption in supply chain management is receiving increasing attention, along with highlights of critical factors. This paper offers a building block model that is in three main phases; pre-adoption, adoption, and the post adoption. The model indicates that adoption context, blockchain technology platform offerings, strategic responses, and adoption readiness are some key building blocks, particularly at the pre-adoption phase. Trust and supply chain network, firm resources, and blockchain costs are all considered critical in the considerations of the building blocks. In addition, aligning supply chain objectives with blockchain systems is critical and so is blockchain compatibility. Law and governance are amongst the two prominent challenges in blockchain adoption and should be considered as part of the building blocks for blockchain adoption. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI THE EFFECT OF PROBLEMS ON SUPPLY CHAIN WIDE EFFICIENCY
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB For any business to compete successfully in the modern, globalised business environment, it needs to mobilise its suppliers and customers to co-operate in order to reduce unnecessary costs and inefficiencies between them and to ensure the best value for the final customer. The focus is on management of the supply chain as a whole (or a system) and maximum value for the final customer of the supply chain, instead of on management for the maximum benefit of one of the parties in the supply chain. If the supply chain is seen as a system of organisations with one aim (value for the final customer), it is logical that a problem in one part of the supply chain must affect the workings and efficiency of the system or supply chain as a whole.
   This article reports on an exploratory empirical study to illustrate the effect of problems at one party in the supply chain on the whole supply chain. The study was done at automotive component manufacturers. To determine how problems at one place permeate through the whole supply chain, correlation testing was done between supplyside, internal operations, and distribution or customer-side problems. The study found that problems experienced at one place in the supply chain had a negative impact throughout the supply chain. Automotive supply chains should therefore be managed more as a system, taking into consideration the effect of decision making and actions at one part of the supply chain on other parts of the supply chain. There should be a supply chain wide co-operative effort to find solutions to inefficiencies at all places in the supply chain.

TI Supply chain corruption practices circumventing sustainability
   standards: wolves in sheep's clothing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose A growing number of private, voluntary and mandatory sustainability standards have recently emerged. However, supply chain corruption practices as mechanisms to circumvent sustainability standards have also grown and occur regularly. This paper strives to elaborate theory on the intersection of institutional theory, business corruption and the sustainability standards literature by investigating factors that influence the emergence of supply chain corruption practices. Design/methodology/approach Based on secondary data, four in-depth case studies of supply chain corruption practices are investigated through the use of adaptive theory and the method of constant comparisons to elaborate theory on this important phenomenon. Findings The paper suggests that although sustainability standards can improve supply chain sustainability performance, if they are adopted only symbolically and not substantively, unanticipated outcomes such as supply chain corruption may occur. The study proposes a typology of supply chain corruption practices, further explores the symbolic adoption of sustainability standards in supply chains and proposes the novel construct of "social isomorphism for corruption." Since focal companies play central roles in leading supply chain corruption practices, we reason that they can also play a pivotal role in preventing supply chain corruption practices by promoting the substantive adoption of sustainability standards across their supply chains. Originality/value This paper elaborates theory on the challenging phenomenon of corruption in supply chains by linking the supply chain management literature to the corruption and the sustainability discourses and offers important insights to aid our understanding on the topic. It generates six propositions and four contributions to the sustainable supply chain management theory, practice and policy.

   in the globalized green supply chain network
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Modern business traits and global-scale logistics operations have urged companies to devise responsive and efficient supply chain networks to fulfill customer demands all- around the world. However, such operations have increased resource consumption and pollution production, causing more environmental damage. To address these issues, postponement strategies are adopted to enable responsive and more environmentally friendly supply chain operations. However, only a few studies on supply chain optimization considering postponement strategies and environmental issues have been conducted. It motivates this study to propose a mixed-integer model of an integrated green supply chain network (GSCN) for both single and multi-period planning horizons that incorporate postponement concept, and modularized products and processes. Using these models, various speculation strategies coupled with postponement strategies can be analyzed in configuring green supply chain system with mass customization principle subjected to various carbon tax and carbon cap policies under a global supply chain environment. Computational examples of a mass customization notebook computer supply chain show that postponing product differentiation reduces excessive production processes. As a result, the configured supply chain is able to comply with strict environmental policies with just a slight cost increase. This justifies postponement strategies application in configuring eco-efficient supply chain operations.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The establishment of supply chain innovation enterprises is conducive to maximizing production efficiency, deepening the division of labor mechanism in all links, and promoting supply-side structural reform. In order to study the factors related to the distribution of supply chain innovation enterprises, this study was based on the pilot list of the first and second batches of supply chain innovation enterprises in Zhejiang Province from 2017 to 2019, and based on the geographical location points of 187 enterprises. The POI data were analyzed with the GeoDa 1.20 and ArcMap 10.8 systems, using tools such as the Moran index, nearest neighbor index, point density estimation, standard deviational ellipse, etc. The analysis results show that the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of supply chain innovation enterprises in Zhejiang Province demonstrate global autocorrelation and a high degree of local aggregation, forming a "one main multi-point" distribution with Hangzhou as the center. The influencing factors are mainly affected by employment density and local economy, and there are multi-factor interactions. Finally, this study puts forward suggestions for the improvement of supply chain innovation enterprises, hoping to promote the sustainable development of supply chain innovation enterprises.

AB In today's uncertain and complex business environment, where an high variability of production is requested, supply chain strategy is playing an important role in the success of a firm's product and market growth strategy. Once considered the meanings of supply chain adaptability, it is easy to understand how much is important to provide a supply-chain that is able to let the company survive to the World's quick sands due to several given listed uncertainties in a complex global-business environment.
   This paper supplies a review of the Progressive Conceptual System (PCSA) approach, making it able to formulate a supply-chain strategy with the ability to shift properly though the threads and changes of the business environment. The challenge has been transforming a static PCSA methodology into a dynamic one then.

TI Sustainable food supply chains: overcoming key challenges through
   digital technologies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to offer a consolidative approach in exploring the potential contribution of digital technologies in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) for the sustainable performance of food supply chain business, through the circular economy concepts. Design/methodology/approach As a single case study, this qualitative, interpretivist research was based on one of the largest food producers in the United Kingdom. The research utilises semi-structured interviews and applies thematic analysis to offer rich insights into SSCM challenges and their relationship with the business performance, through ten in-depth interviews. Findings Findings derived from thematic analysis of the interview transcripts suggest four main critical success factors underpinning SSCM practices and businesses performance - i.e. business continuity, waste reduction, performance measurement approach, and organisational learning, which could use the help of digital technologies to improve. This led to seven propositions to be addressed in the future research. Originality/value This research offers real, practical insights into SSCM challenges, within the context of food supply chain and explores the potential of digital technologies in overcoming them. Accordingly, the primary contribution of this work is grounded in the identification of critical success factors in SSCM for food supply chains (FSC). Hence, this work contributes further to the literature on SSCM, as well as circular economy, by providing a study of a business in the context of the highly pertinent and valuable food industry.

SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY
AB Purpose - Firms are increasingly resorting to responsible supply chain management as they align their economic success with socially responsible initiatives in their value chain. This contribution aims to suggest that there are opportunities for global corporations who are keen on integrating responsible practices into their business operations. It is in their interest to report about their responsible supply chain management, social performance and sustainable innovations to their stakeholders.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper identifies future research avenues in the promising areas of responsible procurement and global supply chain management.
   Findings - The corporations' differentiated strategies as well as their proactive engagement in responsible supply chain management can lead them to achieve a competitive advantage in the long term. The low-cost producers may be neglecting the marketplace stakeholders, including suppliers, distributors among others. Moreover, the smaller businesses' could not be in a position to follow responsible procurement practices, as they may lack the scarce resources to do so.
   Originality/value - This paper raises awareness about the integration of socially responsible behaviours and sustainable practices in business operations. It contends that a responsible supply chain management necessitates an improved relationship with suppliers and distributors in the value chain. This stakeholder engagement with ultimately create value to the businesses themselves.

TI Accounting towards sustainability in production and supply chains
SO BRITISH ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB Growing interest in sustainability and corporate supply chains accompanies increased globalisation across developed and developing countries, a stronger focus on the logistics of procurement behind international trade, and information flows between parties about corporate economic, social and environmental performance. Accounting provides information to oil the wheels of supply chain relationships. The purpose of this paper is to consider what an accounting for sustainability of production and supply chains might look like. An overview is provided of the issues associated with a broadening of accounting needed for sustainable supply chains. The paper highlights: ongoing problems of scope and terminology, lack of a broad sustainability focus because of complexity which stunts the impact on decision makers, and the need for transdisciplinary teams to increase connectedness and performance of the supply chain. The need for further research relating to three issues is identified. First, who undertakes the accounting for supply chains; second, why should a business function account for supply chain involvement; and, third, what information is relevant to different functional managers?

TI Blockchain for Supply Chain Traceability: Business Requirements and
   Critical Success Factors
SO PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries-cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals-and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies' capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability.

TI Sustainability dichotomies of used clothes supply chains: a critical
   review of key concerns and strategic resources
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose- Used clothes supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, fragmented and less transparent due to rising volumes of discarded clothes and its dispersed reverse logistics operations across the Global North (GN) and Global South (GS). While it has a promising impact on circular economy and international trade growth, increasing exports of used clothes and overflowing landfills raise some negative concerns on its overall sustainability. This paper addresses the dichotomy that exists in terms of interpreting the sustainability credentials of used clothes supply chains.Design/methodology/approach- A systematic literature review was carried out and 55 articles were examined to identify the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability impacts of used clothes supply chains. TBL sustainability issues were identified, reflected through the lens of natural resource-based view and interpreted in the form of propositions.Findings- The paper pinpoints seven TBL sustainability concerns and prescribes three sets of strategic resources required in glocal used clothes supply chains for mitigating these. These are (1) slowing the supply chain by tackling poor quality, overproduction and oversupply issues, (2) improving logistics/supply chain infrastructure and ecosystem collaboration and (2) embedding transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures taken by both value chain actors and regulatory bodies, for embracing system-level sustainable development.Originality/value- This is one of the first studies to analyse TBL sustainability of glocal north-south used clothes supply chains. The study is unique in terms of its scope and contribution to the sustainable supply chain literature.

AB A Supply Chain is the series of activities that an organization uses to deliver value to its customers. In today's competitive environment, the globalization of markets has rapidly substituted the traditional integrated business. The competitive success of an organization no longer depends only on its own efforts, but relies on the efficiency of the entire supply chain. Therefore, building an effective supply chain is fast becoming paramount in today's marketplace. Distributed Supply Chain (DSC) Simulation has been identified as one of the best means to test and analyze the performance of supply chains. The Generic Runtime Infrastructure for Distributed Simulation (GRIDS) is a middleware that supports the reuse and interoperation of DSC simulations. This paper reports the experience on employing the GRIDS to support the distributed collaboration of an automobile manufacture supply chain simulation. Several advantages of GRIDS are also discussed here which make it an ideal middleware for DSC simulations.

TI Exploring Attractive Quality Requirements for Short Food Supply Chain
   Digital Platforms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Perceptions towards unsustainable supply chain practices in global, mainstream food systems are motivating a shift towards short food supply chains. Short food supply chains are developed to remove the physical and social distances between producer and consumer. Advances in digital technologies offer promise for short food supply chains, including platforms that can enable real-time data flow, create visibility, and support sustainable practices. This research aims to prioritise attractive quality requirements of short food supply chain digital platforms. The methodology consists of a literature review and Kano analysis for requirements prioritisation. The results show that the requirements span across the four Kano categories, attractive quality encompassing the largest number of requirements. The attractive quality requirements identified offer increased levels of satisfaction when present and have limited negative impact when missing. Therefore, they are considered exciting for potential users of a system. The limitations of the research and areas of future work are presented.

TI The Maize Supply Chain Coordination Mechanism under Yield Uncertainty
   Caused by Drought: A Study in the Heilongjiang Province of China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Deficient rainfall due to drought is an inevitable factor triggering maize yield uncertainty, thus affecting the performance and sustainability of the supply chain. Therefore, this paper first uses historical data to quantitatively fit the unfavorable effect of rainfall on maize yield affected by drought, taking the maize planting in the Heilongjiang Province of China as an example. Then, using a Stackelberg game, payback revenue sharing (PBRS), and cost revenue sharing (CRS), contract mechanisms are developed to coordinate the maize supply chain incorporating yield uncertainty from drought and demand risk faced by the retailer. We investigate the impact of uncertain maize yield on the supply chain and conduct numerical experiments to verify the analysis. The results reveal that declining rainfall, representing increasing drought severity, negatively affects the profits of the entire supply chain and its members; however, supply chain efficiency is raised under both coordinated contracts. In addition, the yield risk-sharing proportion was higher under a CRS mechanism than a PBRS one, which gives more incentives for the vulnerable supplier to participate in the supply chain. Finally, our analysis indicates that rearranging contract structures and parameters based on classic revenue sharing contracts could realize supply chain coordination.

TI Achieving sustainability through the lean and resilient management of
   the supply chain abstract
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - In the present work, lean and resilient practices applied to supply chains are studied in order to evaluate their impact on the three dimensions of sustainability. Additionally, the mutual impact of lean and resilient supply chain practices is investigated. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The aerospace sector and its supply chain are chosen, since lean and resilient practices have been proven relevant in the sector. A methodology based on Interpretive Structural Modeling approach is applied in order to identify the existing relationships between lean and resilient supply chain practices and their impact on the three different dimensions of sustainability.
   Findings - The results reveal synergetic effects between lean and resilient practices. The former practices act as drivers of the latter practices. Hence, lean practices lead to direct and indirect effects in achieving supply chain sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications - The relationship between lean and resilient practices has been studied for the aerospace sector. Different sectors may lead to different results as the practices considered important in each sector may differ as well as the way in which each practice is implemented.
   Originality/value - This study highlights the relationship existing between lean and resilient supply chain practices and their impact on sustainability. Additionally, several managerial implications are drawn out to help managers make better decisions.

TI Dynamic game of corporate social responsibility in a supply chain with
   competition
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In the background of economic globalization, the rapid development of information technology and the individualization of customer demand make it difficult for a single enterprise to cope with the increasingly complex market competition. The traditional competition mode between enterprises is difficult to continue. Instead, it is the competition between one supply chain and another supply chain that becomes important. To obtain a sustainable competitive advantage, corporate social responsibility has gradually become the focus of supply chain management. In reality, enterprises in supply chains generally have a long-term, dynamic and stable cooperative relationship, and their corporate social responsibilities have complexity characteristics, which would change with time. Therefore, it is more practical to conduct a dynamic research on the social responsibility decisionmaking in competitive supply chains under the continuous time background. This study contributes a new approach to the literatures on competitive supply chains and corporate social responsibilities in supply chains by extending the static perspective to a dynamic one, so as to analyze the application of corporate social responsibilities in competitive supply chains. By constructing competition models with two two-echelon supply chains, this paper uses differential game theory to study the decision-making related to corporate social responsibility in supply chains in three situations: decentralized decision-making, centralized decision-making and combined decision-making. This paper determine and contrast the optimal price and corporate social responsibility decision-making in each situation, and analyze the impacts of corporate social responsibility, supply chain reputation and supply chain competition on supply chain revenues. Through simulation analysis, this paper find that corporate social responsibility is an effective tool to realize sustainable supply chain. The corporate social responsibility effect of the centralized supply chain is the greatest. Consumer social responsibility preference, corporate social responsibility efficiency and competition intensity are positively correlated with corporate social responsibility effort. Discount rate and CSR cost coefficient are negatively correlated with corporate social responsibility effort. Finally, some managerial implications are put forward based on the research results.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB To help enterprises improve their sustainable development as well as the competition ability in their supply chain, a research is conducted on the efficiency of the supply chain embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and issues in sustainable development. At first, the present work determines the connection between efficiency of the supply chain with the environmental performance. Then, it illustrates how the efficiency of the AI supply chain influences the environment of enterprises. Next, an evaluation is made on the influence of AI supply chain efficiency on the social sustainable development. In the empirical analysis, the data of Global Competitiveness Report and Environmental Performance Index Report from 2008 to 2017 are collected. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are used to determine the relationship between AI supply chain efficiency and sustainable development and innovation. The Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) has been computed to ascertain if there are significant bivariate relationships between the variables of interest. There are two components of reducing waste and consumption pressures that are significantly and positively correlated with AI supply chain efficiency. These are ecological footprint per capita (r = .662, p = .000) and waste recycling rates (r = .631, p = .000). The present work identifies the connection between AI supply chain efficiency and sustainable development and innovation. Moreover, the AI supply chain promotes technological innovation among enterprises and the sustainable development of enterprises themselves.

The research was based on comparing energy models built with the Passive House Planning Package, and included thermal bridging calculations performed in the THERM software. For each energy model, only the effect of improved exterior insulation was isolated and analysed. Starting from the energy model built for code compliant construction, insulation thickness was then increased and air tightness improved until the energy model reached the Passive House energy efficiency level. Achieving the Passive House energy efficiency required 152 mm of exterior insulation and 420 mm of batt insulation in a double stud wall, due to poor internal volume to exterior surface area ratio for the single detached dwelling and rectangular building shape.

TI Analysis of supply chain vulnerability factors in manufacturing
   enterprises: a fuzzy DEMATEL approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB With an increase in supply chain disruptions, managing supply chain vulnerability has become a key factor to build resilient supply chains. Although supply chain vulnerability and associated factors are mostly studied individually or with selected groups, the supply chain literature lacks comprehensive and systematic studies. The current study aims to identify and segregate the supply chain vulnerability factors for manufacturing enterprises based on causal-effect relationships that exist between them. The supply chain vulnerability factors are identified from the extant literature review. Its applicability in Indian manufacturing enterprises is discussed with experts drawn from industry and academia. The cause-effect relationships of selected supply chain vulnerability factors are analysed using the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach. The obtained results indicate that supply design and supply chain efficiency-related factors are effect factors, whereas supply chain collaboration and information technology-related factors are causal factors. Complexity, centralisation, supplier concentration and low-cost sourcing are found to be the most prominent factors. This research contributes to the literature on supply chain vulnerability by describing the causal relationships among key factors impacting it. It would help managers to develop appropriate disruptions mitigation strategy(s) to make a resilient and robust supply chain.

TI Life cycle assessment of a single-family residence built to either
   conventional- or passive house standard
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The environmental and resource impacts of wooden single-family residences designed to meet the conventional Norwegian Building Code from 2010 (TEK10) and the Norwegian passive house standard NS 3700 are compared using life cycle assessment. Four different heating systems are evaluated for the two building designs: (1) electric (resistance heating), (2) electric and wood, (3) electric and a solar heat collector and (4) electric and an air-water heat pump system. The goal of the research is to evaluate the different ways of lowering the total environmental burden of a building's life cycle, considering the two building standards, and evaluating the impacts due to implementation of renewable heating systems in comparison to standard Norwegian systems largely based on electricity.
   The life cycle results show that the wood-framed single-family residence built according to the passive house standard provides a consistent and clear reduction of cumulative energy demand of 24-38% in comparison to the conventional building standard TEK10 with electric panel heating. In combination with efficient heating systems, a passive house building envelope with a heat pump system provides the largest savings, an improvement of almost 40% compared to a conventional house with electric heating. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of the cleanest design compared to the standard alternative is almost 30%. Solar heated water also provides substantial environmental gains for the passive house. On the other hand, a standard building envelope with a heat-pump system reduces impacts to a level comparable to that of a passive house building with only electric heating. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI SCOR model application in developing countries: challenges &
   requirements
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB Due to the changes in the nature of business and competition from company versus company to supply chain versus supply chain, the importance of improving the entire supply chain holistically is becoming an increasingly important topic in recent studies. Industry practitioners and academics are focusing on developing a modelling tool for this purpose. However, such efforts were unsuccessful. The main reasons for failure are that the existing models are developed and tested based on the experiences of manufacturing firms in the developed world. The nature of the existing firms, their operating and business processes situation in developing countries vary greatly from the manufacturing processes and the surrounding environment in developed countries. However, the absence of an agreed upon, common language and standardised modelling tools for the entire supply chains hampers the global supply chain improvement initiatives. This paper focuses on addressing the issue of a how standardised and widely accepted model, like the SCOR, can be applied despite the different circumstances. The firms' supply chain characteristics and new requirement for the model adaptation were collected based on the available literature and field analysis results. The research paper results focus on the make and delivery processes for illustration and evaluation.

The methodological framework introduced allows the identification of circular food waste flows that can maximise the sustainability of food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach Following a qualitative approach, circular economy perspectives are combined with core industrial ecology concepts in the specification of a standardised analytical method to map food waste flows and industrial synergies across a supply chain. Findings The mapped waste flows and industrial linkages depict two time-related scenarios: (1) current scenarios showing the status quo of existing food waste flows, and (2) future scenarios pointing out circular flows along the supply chain. The future scenarios inform potential alternatives to take waste flows up the food waste hierarchy. Research limitations/implications The qualitative approach does not allow generalisations of findings out of the scope of the study. The framework is intended for providing focussed analysis, case by case. Future research involving mixed methods where quantitative approaches complement the qualitative perspectives of the framework would expand the analytical perspective. Originality/value The framework provides a relatively low-cost and pragmatic method to identify alternatives to minimise landfill disposals and improve the sustainability of food supply chains. Its phased methodology and standardised outcomes serve as a referential basis to inform not only comparative analysis, but also policymaking and strategic decisions aimed at transforming linear food supply chains into circular economy ecosystems.

TI RANKING OF INTEGRATION FACTORS WITHIN SUPPLY CHAINS OF FORWARD AND
   BACKWARD TYPES - RECOMMENDATIONS FROM RESEARCHES
SO LOGFORUM
AB Background: Integration trends are one of main determinants of the development of modern logistics. After the period of interest focused mainly on supply chains realizing one-way flows only, at present there is a time for supply chains characterized by two-way flows, realizing at the same time both forward and backward flows. The possibility of various configurations of such chains requires identification of integration factors and determination of their influence on the results of the whole supply chain. Experiences of the science as well as the practice of supply chains show the urgent need of learning of reasons of the integration within supply chains of the two-way type.
   Material and methods: The researches on modeling and simulation of integration processes within supply chains of forward and backward type were carried out in the environment of iGrafx Process 2013 for Six Sigma. The empirical material obtained in these researches was put to the statistical analysis by the used of Minitab 17. The identification of the significance of differences was made with the help of analysis of variance ANOVA. Additionally the analysis of differences in form of absolute averages was made. The following measures are main ones for the evaluation of the integration of a supply chain of forward and backward types: cashflow, profitability, service level.
   Results: 8 192 simulation experiments were made for 6 integration factors: accessibility of recycled materials, production planning, stock management, integration of transport, unification of packing materials and optimization of the material flow. Based on the analysis of the significance and values of differences, the results of the influence of each integration factor on global results of supply chains of forward and backward type were obtained. They were used to prepare the ranking of integration factors. The main factors, forming the integration shape of two-way supply chains were: stock management, production planning and accessibility of recycled materials.
   Conclusions: The integration offers new possibilities therefore it is the promising option of actions. In complicated and complex logistic reality, it is more and more difficult to function, in economic sense, without starting and tightening close cooperation. Sometimes it is even not possible at all. The growing popularity of two-way supply chains opens the dimensions of the possible cooperation. However, both science and the practice need the reliable quantitative information covering the conscious creation of the integration in supply chains. Such tool could be a ranking, recommended in this paper, of integration factors from the perspective of three measures of evaluation of global level of functioning of the supply chain.

AB New challenges and opportunities are encountered in the present supply chain management. In addition to the competition of the markets in the globe, limitation of energy, raw and virgin materials, environmental protection crisis and increase of global population are causing unprecedented issues to the worldwide supply chains for obtaining of goods and services for customers efficiently and effectively. Conventional supply chain management (SCM) considered three stages: pre-manufacture, manufacture and use, while the present enterprises need to consider the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) for competitiveness and stability in the market. SSCM stages are: pre-manufacture, manufacture, use and post-use. Sustainable enterprises, also promote three core aspects: Environmental, Economical and Social. In this paper, it discusses the 6Rs of sustainable manufacturing in SSCM with regard to the three core aspects. A conceptual model is proposed for sustainable supply chain management information systems and this model is demonstrated in a case study.

TI The effects of inter-firm power and supply partner assessment on supply
   chain integration
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB With rapid changes in technology and globalization of markets, it has become very difficult for firms to "go it alone". World-class companies, therefore, seek to enhance competitive performance by effectively linking them with the external operations of supply chain members. Several factors are critical to effective integration. Supplier's power is one of the major factors influencing supply chain integration. Supplier's characteristics determined its power. Inter-firm power affects buyers and suppliers' decision and subsequently, the performance of the buyer. The relationships among supplier's assessment, power, cooperative attitude and supply chain integration are hypothesized and investigated based on empirical data collected from companies in semiconductor component manufacturing supply chain. The results demonstrate that both power structure and suppliers' characteristics influence supply chain integration. Managerial insights are provided accordingly for companies to achieve better supply chain integration in nowadays highly competitive environments.

TI How blockchain technology improves sustainable supply chain processes: a
   practical guide
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology has rapidly grown in the last decade and supply chain management has started to emerge as one of its possible fields of application. Blockchain is estimated to have a transformative impact and potentially transform and disrupt supply chains. However, despite recognizing its enormous opportunity, there is still an incomplete, dispersed, and fragmented knowledge of blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Very few business people still deeply understand how blockchain works and how it can concretely benefit supply chains. This paper contributes to closing this gap, providing a holistic approach to analyzing blockchain technology's applications and benefits in supply chain management. This study aims to support academics and practitioners in adopting a holistic perspective and realizing the potential this technology can offer in different areas of the supply chain, its managerial impact, challenges, and limitations. A "closed-loop " value chain perspective is adopted to analyze the benefits at each core process of the supply chain, from sourcing to final customer and reverse logistics. This paper conducts qualitative research using case studies analysis based on secondary data. Further, it builds a theoretical framework for blockchain-enhanced supply chain performance based on the results of the qualitative research. Finally, the paper discusses the major drawbacks and barriers to blockchain implementation, which help managers evaluate its real net benefits.

AB In today's fierce global environment, continuous performance measurement is the key mantra for any kind of business successes. The performance measurement system is a framework to measure the efficiency of the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to review the dearth of research into performance measurement systems in the context of the supply chain by reviewing the contemporary literature for the last two decades and evoking the potential avenues for future research. For this purpose, the authors have considered and classified the supply chain performance measurement systems as approaches and techniques and followed a systematic literature review procedure. Finally, this paper discloses that simulation techniques are more suitable than other performance techniques and approaches for the supply chain performance measurement in a volatile environment. The study also provides a strong basis for future researchers and academicians in applying the performance measurement systems in the context of the dynamic supply chain. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Constructing green supply chain system is a necessary requirement to establish the "two-oriented society" and implement sustainable development system. It has an important significance to the whole society to set up correct consumption views and social values. Based on analyzing the research status quo of related green supply chain and the existing problems at home and abroad, this paper combined the new mission that "two-oriented society" endowed to social development, and put forward the following two new ideas to construct the green supply chain: the first is to strengthen the resource management of supply chain using TOC theory, definitude emphases on resource control, find the entry point to foster awareness of saving resources, and set up the coordinated control mechanism of supply chain that could make it in continuous optimization process; the second is to advance the process of environmental protection practice by using computer information technology. It could construct network platform, establish green database, advanced information system and computer simulation technology to strengthen the communication among enterprises, government and academia. The main purpose is to encourage the enterprise to go the way of environmental protection and implement the conception of green supply chain practically.

TI The impact of cloud-enabled process integration on supply chain
   performance and firm sustainability: the moderating role of top
   management
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose Theorising from the intersection of supply chain and information systems (IS) literature, this study aims to investigate supply chain integration (SCI) as a multidimensional construct in the context of cloud-based technology and explores the effect of cloud-enabled SCI on supply chain performance, which will eventually improve firm sustainability from a resource-based view (RBV). In addition, the moderating effect of top management is explored.
   Design/methodology/approach Using cross-sectional survey data collected from a sample of 105 Australian retail firms, this study used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesised relationship of cloud-enabled SCI with performance in a theoretical model.
   Findings Results show that cloud-based technology has positive effect on SCI, and the cloud-enabled SCI is positively related to supply chain performance which eventually influenced firm sustainability. Further, top management intervention moderates the relationship between supplier and internal integration with supply chain performance. But it is found to have no moderating effect on the relationship between customer integration and supply chain performance.
   Practical implications Recognising the potential benefits of emerging cloud-based technologies reported in this study, retail managers need to understand that higher order SCI requires the support of cloud-based technology to improve supply chain performance and firm sustainability.
   Originality/value This research extends prior research of information and communication technologies-enabled SCI and its effect on supply chain performance which overly remains inconsistent. In addition, IS literature abounds with discussion on cloud computing technology per se, and its adoption in supply chain is overly rhetoric. This study fills this gap by conceptualising the multiple dimensions of SCI enabled by cloud-based technology and the way it affects supply chain and firm sustainable performance. Investigating SCI in context of cloud-based technology is a unique contribution in this study. The moderating effect of top management in this decision also adds to the current body of literature.

TI Evaluation and selection strategy for green supply chain using
   interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy combinative distance-based
   assessment
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environmental deterioration and global warming has created a substantial impact on international companies to incorporate eco-friendly, green supply chain practices and remain competitive in the market. In food supply chain, the selection of the best supply chain management (SCM) strategy can improve the overall performance and can be crucial in managing the food supply chain challenges and achieving sustainable food supply chain. In this paper, different green SCM strategies were explored and evaluated for food supply chain using combinative distance-based assessment method under interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy information as interval extension of q-rung orthopair fuzzy can effectively handle the ambiguity and uncertainty of preference given by experts in decision making. A generalized p-distance between two interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers is proposed in the current study and is used to formulate interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamming distance and interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy Euclid distance. Five supply chain strategies, namely risk-based, efficiency-based, resource-based, innovation-based, and closed-loop strategy, are evaluated to select best strategy for food supply chain based on different attributes such as green manufacturing, green design and development, green management system, green procurement, and green marketing which contribute toward sustainability. It is found that closed-loop supply chain strategy is the best strategy for food supply chain to attain sustainability. A comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis are done to examine the reliability of results obtained from the proposed framework.

TI Towards a New Framework for Sustainable Supply Chain Management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING MATERIALS AND MECHANICAL
   ENGINEERING
AB Recent disruptions in global supply chains have led to increased interest in supply chain risk management investigation. On the other hand, increased environmental regulation has urged firms to compulsorily have their routine operations environmental friendly. Last few years, researchers have investigated these two streams as distinct but have mentioned them to be related in the long run. The current study attempts to bridge this gap of allied literature by conceptually arguing that it to arrive at sustainability in supply chain operations, firms must co-integrate their supply chain risk management and green practices in supply chain. While risk management broadly aims to reduce the exposure to a risky situation coupled with minimizing the negative impact of disruption of firm performance; green practices aims to make operational, tactical and strategic operations of the firm environment friendly. Based on sufficient theoretical tenets from related literature, the study attempts to develop a theoretical model linking supply chain risk management, green supply chain practices and sustainable supply chain. In doing so, the study provides an indicative list of various risk classifications and proposed risk mitigating strategies till date. Finally, the study indicates managerial implications and suggests further research opportunities.

SO BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Purpose Supply chain management plays an important role in sustaining businesses in today's competitive environment. Therefore, industrial managers are focusing on exploring the key performance improvement attributes of supply chain management to achieve a better position in the global market. Aimed at ensuring best supply chain management practices, this study presents the key performance improvement attributes, known as critical success factors (CSFs), within the context of the apparel supply chain of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the interpretive structural modeling method (ISM) has been applied to develop a structural framework to analyze the contextual relationship among the factors under consideration. MICMAC (Matriced' Impacts Croise ' s Multiplication Applique ' e a ' unClassement) analysis has also been performed to define the classification of the CSFs in terms of their driving and dependence power. Findings The research findings reveal that supply chain collaboration/partnership and customer satisfaction are of crucial importance to success in the context of supply chain management of the readymade (RMG) garments industry of Bangladesh. Further evidence suggests that these, along with other success factors, can assist in achieving a competitive advantage and better market position. A number of theoretical and managerial implications have been provided for managers and practitioners, and for further evaluation of the study. Originality/value This paper considers a new supply chain problem which identifies and evaluates critical success factors. This paper also develops a new structural model for evaluating critical success factors.

AB The changing business conditions of the 21(st) century has led to companies facing issues ranging from globalisation, economic uncertainty to new technologies and increasing consumer demands. In the automobile industry, as manufacturers design and build vehicles globally, their supply chains become increasingly complex with challenges that often stand in the way of profitability and higher shareholder value such as long order-to-delivery lead times, unreliable production schedules, excess inventory across the supply chain, lengthy demand planning cycles and lack of visibility of suppliers. The effect of the global economic meltdown increased the pressure on automotive executives to make right decisions about their supply chain for better performance. In a highly challenging and competitive environment such as today, where supply chain is a popular tool for improving the organisational competitiveness, an efficient and effective supply chain strategy is a must for automotive manufacturers and their component manufacturers so as to meet changing consumer demands. The paper explores the concept of lean and agility as generic supply chain strategies and presents a strategic supply chain framework for the automobile industry as a possible strategy to respond to changing consumer demand.

TI Supply chain resilience in a Covid-19 scenario: Mapping capabilities in
   a systemic framework
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB COVID-19 hits the global supply chains in a non-paradigm manner unfolding new and systemic complexity. Therefore, the unexpected and frequent disruptions forced the concern of preventing or creating supply chain resilience capabilities. This paper aims to provide theoretical and practical reflections on resilience in supply chains of essential goods during pandemics using a systems approach. Documental research was performed in order to characterize business practices in consulting reports and interviews with managers published in business communication media. Thus, a careful content analysis was carried out, including the coding and categorization of the leading practices indicated by these vehicles. We suggest categories of resilience factors as new concepts to face the new normal in the supply chains. These categories are Technology and People, Sourcing, Customer, Ecosystem, and Financial Assets. The systems approach consists of more qualified supply chain management stimulating several inputs and synchronized actions to sense and respond to the external environment dynamics.

AB As the issue of sustainability became of a prime importance in the global market during the last few years, a growing number of research has addressed green supply chain management, its drivers, barriers and implementation frameworks. However there is a significant gap in research that examines the green supply chain issues in Africa and the Middle East. Therefore, this research focuses on identifying the barriers and challenges that face the Egyptian organizations during the implementation of green supply chain management in order to be the basis for a green supply chain management migration model. The model is designed upon overcoming the identified challenges to facilitate the adoption of green supply chains.

TI Weak links in the supply chain: measuring fragility and sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - There is significant anecdotal evidence of increasing global supply chain fragility; and, for this reason, robustness and operational sustainability are of notable concern to senior executives. Though the issues are myriad, four factors dominate these concerns: increasing complexity of products, processes, and technologies, increasing structural complexity of supply chains, increasing diversity and global nature of business systems, and the environmental costs and impacts of extended supply chains. This paper aims to focus on these factors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual, theoretical paper differentiates corporate sustainability and operational robustness in terms of profitability and costs, then defines and develops internal, external, and uncontrollable fragility factors. A process that measures and integrates these factors is proposed for brainstorming and decision making. Additionally, methods to represent and compare alternatives, progress against internal or external targets, and industry goals or known competitor values are offered.
   Findings - This study describes and demonstrates an easy-to-implement process to address the potentially disastrous consequences of supply chain fragility.
   Practical implications - This study offers both academicians and practitioners a model to research, assess, and identify the risks and costs of current levels of supply chain fragility and to weigh various solutions.
   Originality/value - Unfortunately, few research efforts define these issues or identify the associated risks. Further, little has been put forward to posit, model, and facilitate the practical decision process to address these factor relationships. To these ends, the paper proposes a "fragility index" to help supply chain managers assess sources and potential costs of fragility, sustainability, and the associated environmental stress in their supply chains.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
AB In emerging markets, there are data quality problems. In this paper, we establish theoretical models to explore how data quality problems affect sustainable fashion supply chain operations. We start with the decentralized supply chain and find that poor data quality lowers supply chain profit and social welfare. We consider the implementation of blockchain to help and identify the situation in which blockchain helps enhance social welfare but brings harm to supply chain profitability. We propose a government sponsor scheme as well as an environment taxation waiving scheme to help. We further extend the study to the centralized supply chain setting.

TI Thinking green: The role of smart technologies in transforming cities'
   waste and supply Chain's flow
SO CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The literature on sustainability is vast and spans across social, economic and environmental domains. This paper looks at the role digital technologies can have in helping the transition to environmentally sustainable conducts across the different domains of economic life. In particular, it investigates the green potential yield in the development of Smart Cities as facilitators of sustainable practices at the individual and supply chain levels. Smarter cities and industries can help the transition to more ecological modes of production and distribution of goods, making our supply networks greener and realise the ambitious Circular Supply Chain (CSC) project. The present work proposes a formulation of the Smart City as centred on users' needs and illustrates how a Smart City can be instrumental to realising a Circular Economy (CE) reporting the case of solid waste management. It introduces Circular Supply Chains as the optimal solution to attain green management practices inside the production network and argues that Smart Cities are crucial to deliver the desired circularity in the chain.

TI A Novel Hybrid Methodology to Study the Risk Management of Prefabricated
   Building Supply Chains: An Outlook for Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The management of the prefabricated building supply chain involves the entire process of prefabricated buildings. There are many uncertain factors, and the risk factors in any link will affect the overall operation of the supply chain. In order to achieve the "dual carbon" goal as soon as possible and promote the sustainable development of the building supply chain, it is very important to study the risk management of the assembly building supply chain. The risk management of the prefabricated building supply chain involves risk recognition, risk prediction, risk assessment, and risk response. In this study, on the basis of literature research, the WBS-RBS (Work Breakdown Structure-Risk Breakdown Structure) method comprehensively uses the working link and risk type of the prefabricated building supply chain to establish an indicator system for risk factors in the prefabricated building supply chain. Then, the risk prediction and evaluation model of the neural network of BP (Back Propagation) through Python software is established to predict the risk of prefabricated building supply chains. After verification, it was found that the accuracy of the training set and test set reached 100% and 96.6667%. The results showed that the BP neural network had good effects on the risk forecast of the prefabricated building supply chain, which provided certain risk predictions for the risk prediction of the prefabricated building supply chain. For reference, on the basis of risk prediction, in order to explore the importance of risk factors to the results of BP neural network prediction results, the characteristic importance algorithm of machine learning replacement features further analyzes the risk factors of the prefabricated building supply chain. Finally, based on the prefabricated construction project of enterprise A, risk prediction and evaluation of its supply chain management were carried out, countermeasures for targeted risks were proposed, and we provided new research on the sustainable development of the assembled building supply chain to provide new research ideas.

TI Blockchain Adoption for Sustainable Supply Chain Management: Economic,
   Environmental, and Social Perspectives
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.

TI Knowledge and cultural diffusion along the supply chain as drivers of
   product quality improvement The illycaffe case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to widen the knowledge base on supply chain learning by exploring and explaining how an enterprise can compete and win in the international market by integrating quality management practices along its supply chain and, above all, by becoming the coordinator in a supply chain learning (SCL) network.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an exploratory case study on a group operating in the coffee market that is universally recognised for the high quality of its products: illycaffe.
   Findings - This paper illustrates and explains how the illycaffe Group implements, competes and wins in the international market because of its exemplary business strategies, its focus on the competitive priority of quality, and consistent and integrated supply chain management practices that are sustained by an innovative approach: the diffusion of knowledge, know-how and a culture of excellence in coffee quality along the entire value chain. The authors find that the diffusion of a culture of quality orients supply chain learning towards the continuous improvement of product and service quality, and above all, improves results by encouraging an emergent behaviour across different actors that creates a shared culture.
   Research limitations/implications - The exploratory nature and use of a single case study are the major limitations of this research. Nevertheless, this study may serve as a significant starting point for future research and analysis related to supply chain learning strategies.
   Originality/value - The illycaffe case study contributes to the literature on quality management and on supply chain management suggesting how an enterprise can improve product and service quality using a sustainable SCL strategy based on knowledge/know-how diffusion and a shared culture along the entire supply chain.

TI Supply chain management 1982-2015: a review
SO IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS
AB Organizations need to better design, manage and improve their supply chains as these become global and more complex. To do this, they need to learn from other organizations and sectors, preempt problems before they occur, and understand the future challenges they may face. Although over 40,000 articles and books have been published on supply chain management since the term was coined in 1982, a clear understanding of the emerging trends, current knowledge gaps and potential areas for future development is only now emerging. Our bibliometric analysis of the existing literature suggests we still need to better understand how to manage security, insourcing, sustainability, competition, risk and disruption, and human behaviour within supply chains. Equally, there is still a lack of research within healthcare, disaster and humanitarian supply chains, as well as within small and medium enterprises.

TI Affordable housing issue: Experimental investigation on properties of
   eco-friendly lightweight concrete produced from incorporating periwinkle
   and palm kernel shells
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB In recent times, sustainable production of concrete is now considered a major issue due to continuous depletion of raw resources. Thus, this current study investigates the physical and strength performance of eco-friendly concrete produced with the combination of periwinkle (PWS) and palm kernel shells (PKS) used as an alternative for granite. Two mix ratios of 1:2:4 and 1:1.5:3 (cement: sand: granite) were considered with a 28-day target strength of 20 N/mm2 and 25 N/mm2, respectively. A total number of 144 cubes were produced with PWS and PKS was used as partial replacement for granite in the concrete mixes considered. Physical properties of the materials were determined, while the hardened concrete samples were tested for their density and compressive strength. Obtained results showed that both PWS and PKS are lightweight materials compare to granite, thus significantly influence the concrete density. The results revealed a decreasing trend in the strength development for the mixes. The compressive strength decreases as the combined content of PWS and PKS increases in the concrete mixes. However, concrete containing PWS and PKS produced from mix-ratio of 1:1.5:3 exhibited some comparable strength compare to the control. The results showed that PWS and PKS can be combined equally and used in the production of lightweight concrete at an optimum of 5%. This implies that low-cost lightweight concrete can be produced using a combination of palm kernel and periwinkle shells, thus helping to provide affordable housing and also preserving raw materials.

TI Sustainable green supply chain management: trends and current practices
SO COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to give an up-to-date and structured insight into the literature published during the past decade on sustainable green supply chain management. It also suggests trends for future research based on the research issues identified through systematic and comprehensive analysis of previous studies in the area of green and sustainable supply chain management.
   Design/methodology/approach - A state-of-the-art literature review is carried out by systematically collecting the existing literature over a period of 10 years (2005-2014) and categorizing it on the basis of attributes such as stages in supply chain, methodology and the industries/sectors under consideration. The classification of literature is also done according to the geographic region and year of publication.
   Findings - There has been an increased interest among researchers and practitioners in the area of sustainable green supply chain management in the past decade. A need for achieving sustainability through adoption of greener practices has been universally felt, owing to an increasing environmental and ecological complexity. The review reveals that there exists a need to address behavioural issues like human resource management and supply chain partner relationship management. Moreover, reverse logistics, closed-loop supply chain management and waste management are areas that need special focus to achieve environmental sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications - The current review focuses on research trends in the past 10 years only. Moreover, papers from only good quality, peer-reviewed journals are considered in the study.
   Originality/value - Most of the previous reviews have either focused on specific issues related to sustainable supply chains only or green supply chains. The present study collectively takes into consideration papers both from green supply chain management as well as from sustainable supply chain literature that have a prime focus on environmental sustainability.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper seeks to provide a hybrid framework of sustainable supply chain fuzzy rotation matrix regarding the challenges in today's business environment and the goals pursued by sustainable supply chain, to prioritize effective infrastructure to manage the challenges in ceramic tile industry in Yazd. Design/methodology/approach The research offers a hybrid framework of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and quality function deployment (QFD) model to determine, which one of the goals of a sustainable supply chain can have a greater share in the management of business challenges. Findings The results indicated government regulations that encourage the implementation of sustainable supply chain and management of the consumption of non-renewable resources are among the most important infrastructures that can be effective to manage the challenges of today's business. Originality/value By reviewing the existing research studies in the sustainable supply chain area, it can be found that despite of vast studies, there is no focus on establishing a comprehensive interaction between business challenges management and the fulfillment of sustainable supply chain management goals. So according to this research gap, a new framework was presented in this study to enable tile and ceramic industry managers, to focus on mentioned interaction and manage the businesses challenges in the desired way to achieve sustainable supply chain goals.

TI Analysis of Professionals' and the General Public's Perceptions of
   Passive Houses in Korea: Needs Assessment for the Improvement of the
   Energy Efficiency and Indoor Environmental Quality
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite the economic and environmental benefits of passive houses, their market penetration has been low, which is partially due to misperceptions regarding their cost. This study examined the perceptions of building-related professionals and the general public regarding Korean passive houses to explore strategies for spurring passive house concepts and practices. The participants took an online survey on their interest in and reasons to reside in passive houses and their expected construction costs. The results from two separate groups of participants, including 162 professionals and 130 members of the general public, were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Both the professional and general public groups expressed a strong interest in passive houses because of the comfortable and healthy indoor environment, energy efficiency, cost savings, and sustainability that they provide. However, the expected construction costs of passive houses were perceived differently by the two groups: They were believed to be less expensive by the professionals and more expensive by the public respondents. This difference seems to result from their prior knowledge or experience regarding passive houses. Both groups were willing to pay more and assumed that the high expected costs were related to the construction products, systems, and labor costs of passive houses. The results showed that the lack of information or education on passive houses could be a major barrier to accessing passive houses, especially with the general public, while the cost could pose less of a barrier to the overall growth of the Korean passive house market. Further efforts by the government and industry are needed in order to provide more educational programs and to identify and manufacture more reasonably priced construction materials.

TI Using a supply chain analysis to assess the sustainability of
   farm-to-institution programs
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB Interest in local and sustainable food among colleges and universities has risen considerably in the last decade. This study focuses on how to foster farm-to-institution programs by exploring barriers, opportunities, and potential solutions from different perspectives in the supply chain. We use a values-based supply chain approach to see what unique insights can be offered to people developing and maintaining these programs. Three research methods - a national survey of college students, a survey of institutional food service buyers in California, and in-depth interviews of people in the California distribution system, including farmers, distributors, and food service buyers - are used to collect data and perspectives from throughout the supply chain. Using the concepts from supply chain literature of product flows, financial flows, and information flows, we highlight key insights for various participants in the supply chain. Strengthening information flows and building relationships that allow all parties to build trust over time emerged as one of the most important elements in the success of these values-based supply chains. Educational institutions and the media can support these chains by becoming the vehicles for ongoing exchange of information among supply chain partners and the public.

AB Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems provide a digital platform for the supply chain organizations to communicate and exchange information. In the food industry, SCMs provide the essential software components for monitoring food transportation and product handling. However, contemporary SCM systems suffer from non-traceability, noninteroperability and poor resiliency. Global food supply chains are at risks from cyber threats, which will lead to food shortages and poor quality control. In this paper, we present ChainSCAN, a three-layer design of a fully decentralized and blockchain-based SCM system that protects data security, privacy, and remove single point of failures of traditional SCMs. In addition, ChainSCAN provides a transparent environment to protect physical security of assets from stolen and record all activities of the food supply chain. ChainSCAN leverages four smart contracts to automate and regulate interactions of supply chain participants with the ledger, which can enforce the best practices among all supply chain organizations. Furthermore, ChainSCAN contains a notification system that automatically alerts consumers about food recalls and/or potential misbehaviors.

TI A decision support framework and system for design of sustainable
   pharmaceutical supply chain network
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB With the issues of climate change continuously taking center stage, there is thus a pressing need for the pharmaceutical companies to assess the sustainability of their supply chains. However, the highly regulated nature of the industry has prompted various supply chain decisions such as material sourcing, siting of plants, and distribution network configuration to be locked into the registration of the new drug. This could consequently lead to inefficient supply chain operation during the drug commercial stage, yielding high greenhouse gas emissions per unit of drug product. Previously, we have proposed a systematic framework for design of a sustainable commercial-stage pharmaceutical supply chain network that can be driven from the early drug development stages. In this paper, we extend the framework by incorporating more functionalities. We also introduce a novel decision support system, called PharmaSC, which implements the framework. PharmaSC system has been developed by integrating two computer toolsan Excel-based analytic hierarchy process and LLamasoft's Supply Chain Guruinto one coherent framework for selecting the most suitable suppliers and manufacturers, mapping a supply chain superstructure network, and optimizing the network to identify and resolve trade-offs between economic and environmental factor. To illustrate the system, an industrially motivated case study involving a paclitaxel production is solved.

TI Analysis of the Vulnerability and Resilience of the Tourism Supply Chain
   under the Uncertain Environment of COVID-19: Case Study Based on Lijiang
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The uncertainty environment brought about by COVID-19 has broken the original stable hierarchical network structure and the whole supply and demand system of the tourism supply chain (TSC), which has brought heavy losses to the tourism industry. Using the case research and consensual qualitative research (CQR) method, taking the real situation and perception of individual supply chain members as a window, supplemented by the narrative insertion of Lijiang Yulong Tourism Co., Ltd., Lijiang Old Town and Yulong Snow Mountain scenic areas, the general laws of the vulnerability and resilience of the TSC were glimpsed. The results show that there are vulnerability factors in the TSC including the supply side, demand side, government side, destination economic structure and supply chain attributes, which lead to the interruption and damage of the TSC after the outbreak of the pandemic. At the same time, China's overall economic environment, tourism demand side, supply side, government side and market participants all have resilience elements. Behind the vulnerability, there is a power of recovery and opportunities for innovation and change. The TSC shows a trend of restorative growth. Theoretically, it helps to enrich theories of TSC and supply chain management under an emergency crisis. In practice, the response behavior of participants at different levels of the supply chain is also the basis for TSC risk management and formulation of optimization strategies in the future, which helps tourism sustainable development in the uncertain environment.

TI Sustainable consumption and production in the food supply chain: A
   conceptual framework
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Increased globalization and a growing world population have a great impact on the sustainability of supply chains, especially within the food industry. The way food is produced, processed, transported, and consumed has a great impact on whether sustainability is achieved throughout the whole food supply chain. Due to the complexity that persists in coordinating the members of food supply chain, food wastage has increased over the past few years. To achieve sustainable consumption and production (SCP), food industry stakeholders need to be coordinated and to have their views reflected in an optimized manner. However, not much research has been done concerning the influence of stakeholders and supply chain members' coordination in the food industry's SCP context. To facilitate the theory development for SCP, in this work, a short literature review on sustainable supply chain management and sustainable supply chains in the food industry is provided to give the reader current knowledge,on how the past and current research are introduced in this work. Following that, different theories that drive sustainable consumption and production have been identified and focused. As a result, theories like the institutional theory, dynamic capability theory, and stakeholder theory are presented. Additionally, a conceptual framework has been developed by identifying the indicators, drivers, and barriers based on the stakeholder theory to achieve the SCP in food supply chain. Finally, limitations and future scope are discussed.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Over the past 10 years, it is figured out by the firms that effective strategies are needed for increasing the competitiveness of their supply chains. Therefore, the supply chain's traditional view has been developed to sustainable supply chain perspective. Organizations that emphasize on the importance of sustainability will benefit from improved performance. For categorizing the supply chain indicators, sustainability deployment is necessary to identify the second layer or dimensions and aspects of sustainability in addition to the main sustainability dimensions such as the economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Literature has shown that in the important paradigm of sustainability, careful attention is not paid to the distinction between dimensions and aspects of sustainability. Therefore, for smoothing implementation and assessment of sustainability, consideration of the role and effect of dimensions and aspects of sustainability is essential. This paper is conducted by two fundamental and practical objectives. First, the dimensions and aspects of sustainability have been investigated and identified highlighting the lacks of conflicts in the literature. Second, the most important dimensions and aspects of sustainability are identified in one of the supply chains of Iran's oil companies using experts' opinions. The results of this research is beneficial for the researchers to consider the sustainability aspects and improve the related measures of their industries.

AB The demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an energy commodity is increasing, although its respective supply chain is subjected to risks, uncertainties, and disturbances. An analysis of experiences from the global LNG supply chain highlights many of these risks. As such, there is an incumbent need to develop resilient LNG supply chains. In this study, the risks associated with the LNG supply chain are categorized into four dimensions: Political and regulatory, safety and security, environmental effects, and reliability of new technologies. A SWOT method is then implemented to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within the LNG supply chain, where the LNG supply chain of Qatar is considered as a case study. Relevant strategies are then recommended using a SWOT matrix to maximize strengths and opportunities, while avoiding or minimizing weaknesses and threats within the LNG supply chain. Finally, major parameters to be considered to develop a resilient LNG management model are listed based on the level of priority from LNG producer and receiver perspectives. Thus, as part of creating a robust LNG supply chain, decision-makers and stakeholders are urged to use the learnings from the SWOT analysis and experiences from LNG supply chain management.

TI Sustainable Supply Chain Management and Inter-Organizational Resources:
   A Literature Review
SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB On the basis of a content analysis, this paper explores the role of sustainable supply chain management as a catalyst of generating valuable inter-organizational resources and thus possible sustained inter-firm competitive advantage through collaboration on environmental and social issues. Drawing on the resource-based view and its extension, the relational view, this paper highlights that partner-focused supply management capabilities evolve to corporate core competences as competition shifts from an inter-firm to an inter-supply-chain level. The 'collaborative paradigm' in supply chain management regards strategic collaboration as a crucial source of competitive advantage. Collaboration is even more essential when supply chains aim at ensuring simultaneously economic, environmental and social performance on a product's total life-cycle basis. Inter-firm resources and capabilities emerging from supply-chain-wide collaboration are prone to become sources of sustained inter-firm competitive advantage, since they are socially complex, causally ambiguous and historically grown and hence particularly difficult to imitate by competitors.

AB The business environment has become more competitive due to advancements in technology and globalisation. Emphasising intelligence as a means for dealing with such circumstances, this study examined the role of supply chain intelligence (SCI), which embraces the process of competitive intelligence (CI) in the operations of a supply chain management (SCM). The integration is needed to ensure that this actionable information from CI has a 360-degree view of business activities amongst supply chains. What exactly is supply chain intelligence? How does supply chain intelligence influence business competitiveness in Malaysia? How does supply chain intelligence help businesses to achieve competitive advantages? This paper examined the contribution of supply chain intelligence on business competitiveness by: a) identifying and validating the dimension of supply chain intelligence components, and b) examining the levels of supply chain intelligence usage by businesses. A focus group was employed as a preliminary study to validate the supply chain intelligence components, and subsequently, for the development of the questionnaire for the survey in the study. The results contribute to the literature by emphasising the use of systematic intelligence in supply chain integration to improve business competitiveness.

TI Institutional pressures, sustainable supply chain management, and

   eco-industrial park firms
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB An eco-industrial park is the practical application of sustainable supply chain management at an industrial park level. As the external sustainability of the supply chain becomes more difficult, integrating the circular economy concept into supply chain management is required to achieve an optimal balance of economic, social, and environmental benefits for a company. Based on institutional theory, we construct a concept model according to the paradigm of "institution-conduct-performance."We then test the mechanism and relationships among institutional pressure, supply chain relationship management, sustainable supply chain design, and circular economy capability using data collected from eco-industrial park firms in China via 363 questionnaires. The findings show that institutional pressure has a significant positive impact on supply chain relationship management and sustainable supply chain design; sustainable supply chain management practice is an important factor promoting the improvement of the circular economy capability of companies, and coercive pressure, normative pressure, and mimetic pressure exert different degrees of negative moderating effects. This study expands our knowledge of variables affecting sustainable supply chain management and also provides theoretical guidance for successful green production practices of eco-industrial park firms.

TI Food losses and waste quantification in supply chains: a systematic
   literature review
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically review and critically examine food losses and waste quantification in supply chain, especially in studies that tackle all the supply chain activities in a real context. Design/methodology/approach This work employed a systematic literature review methodology on the extant literature focusing on peer-reviewed journal articles published from 2000 to 2019. Findings A systematic analysis of 117 articles reveals that downstream supply chains are studied to a greater extent than upstream supply chains, with an emphasis on consumer waste. The findings also highlight more than half of the articles focus on only one supply chain activity. In terms of the methodologies, surveys and modelling methods are the most used to measure food losses and wastes, adopt monetary, carbon emission and calorific metrics. This study highlights that while food losses and waste research remains a relevant field of study, it has yet to been fully explored. Research limitations/implications The main limit is the adoption of a systematic review method for food losses and waste quantification in supply chain. Practical implications The results suggest that supply chain managers should invest in acquiring more knowledge about food losses in the global network. Upstream supply chains should be more studied and integrated with the downstream supply chains. Using combined direct and indirect methods has the potential to deal with the contradictions of quantification, the lack of data and reduce losses over time and space. Originality/value Based on this review as the first one focusing exclusively on quantification of food losses and waste in supply chain context, the authors develop an aspiring research agenda that proposes opportunities for future research. Headings
   We analyse 117 studies addressing food losses and waste quantification. Downstream food supply chains are more studied than upstream food supply chains. Case studies of food supply chains in developed countries are more prolific. The main metric to quantify food losses and waste is weight.

AB Due to limited materials and energy, more attention has been paid to the adverse impacts of the global economy's rapid development on the environment and society. The sustainable and long-term development strategy becomes extremely urgent and important for the enterprises. Manufactures and their supply chain should take measures to implement sustainable development strategy in future production. The concept of sustainability is introduced into the field of supply chain and the structure of sustainable chain is constructed in this paper. And a method of sustainable supply chain performance evaluation is proposed. It evaluates the supply chain performance in four dimensions, namely, operational, financial, social and environmental dimensions. Then a performance evaluation model of sustainable supply chain based on AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is established. This paper gives a case to evaluate the sustainable supply chain performance with the model and implications are given finally.

TI Expanding green supply chain performance measurement through emergy
   accounting and analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Emergy accounting has existed for decades. Emergy evaluates the donor side contribution of nature at region or country, macro-level analyses. It has been rarely applied and considered for organizational or supply chain management. In this study we provide an introduction and background on how emergy accounting analysis can be adjusted and applied at the supply chain level. Supplier selection is the example supply chain application for which actual emergy measures are used. The purpose of this study is to introduce the concept as a valuable tool for investigation by operations and supply chain management scholars and practitioners. The application provides some initial insight. This work at the nexus of sustainable supply chains and performance measurement is an initial study with significant future opportunities. These opportunities include effectively internalizing environmental and resource externalities for more thoughtful business models and evaluations. Implications and future research directions are summarized for this important, yet understudied field. It contributes by expanding the supplier performance measurement field.

TI Dynamic supply chain design: a Delphi study of drivers and barriers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Supply chain management has both in academia and practice proven its important role to sustain and further develop companies' competitive advantages. This is with initiatives that focus on cost-efficiencies and turnover improvement. During the last two decades, companies have faced complexity in their supply chains currently with increased global operations. The dynamic business environment forces companies to secure a competitive (re-) design of their supply chains. This paper seeks to advance the understanding on the drivers and barriers for such designs. In total, 39 experts (30 from industrial enterprises, 4 senior supply chain consultants and 5 supply chain management professors) have participated in a four-step Delphi study and have identified main drivers for dynamic supply chain design as being cost reduction, delivery reliability and change in demand for agility. The main barriers are identified as forecasting being too weak, supply chain complexity and product portfolio complexity. In addition, an explorative factor analysis has been carried out to identify how drivers and barriers can be grouped together. Finally, the paper compares the drivers and barriers underlining different competitive strategies.

AB With increasing complexity of global construction supply chains and the substantial contribution such supply chains make to the environment, there is a need to understand how components of these supply chains can be reused and repurposed. Blockchains provide an important basis for recording transactions carried out in supply chains to aid potential reusability.
   A recent example of circularity in the built environment includes the tracking of material reuse across the building lifecycle (from construction to demolition and then reuse). The use of decentralisation and immutability in Blockchains is used to demonstrate how material passports may be supported and used as a basis to create a circular economy in construction.

TI A framework for food supply chain digitalization: lessons from Thailand
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB The promise of digitalization is enormous and nowhere is it more critical than in its potential to transform food supply chain. Consumers have become more educated and are demanding real-time updated information on foods they consumed through digital media. They are also increasingly demanding to know if the foods they consume are environmentally and socially sustainable or not. As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed.

In this context, the present article describes supply chain operations strategies with a circular economy approach, investigated by other authors in literature reviews. It also systematically examines the current trend to address this issue and evaluates each article based on the employed keywords, such as operations strategy, supply chain, and global, sustainable, and circular economy. The main findings show 13 review articles of the 62 identified in the main academic databases, and indicate that manufacturing industries are mainly implemented operations strategies based on sustainability, green product design, reverse logistics, performance indices, servitisation, among others.

AB Downstream firms must pay more attention to social issues in supply chain, as stakeholders always hold them responsible for activities of their suppliers or sub-suppliers. Although many researchers have studied corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the relationship between CSR and supply chain, there is a dearth of research in the literature on how power asymmetry and joint dependence in Chinese supply chain affect the social responsibility practices of suppliers or customers and further whole supply chain. Based on resources dependence theory, this paper empirically investigated the influence of downstream power adventage (DPA) on suppliers' and whole supply chain's social performance. We also examined if joint dependence (JD) affects the social performance of the whole supply chain. We test the model using data collected from all manufacturing companies that are listed on Shenzhen or Shanghai Stock Exchange in China during 2009-2015. The results show that downstream power advantage (DPA) is positively associated with the social performance of whole supply chain and the usage of power of downstream firms can positively affect the social responsibility behaviors of their suppliers. It is interesting that there is a negative and significant relation-ship between joint dependence (JD) and downstream firms' social performance. At last, some implications of the results are discussed.

TI Management of Social Issues in Supply Chains: A Literature Review
   Exploring Social Issues, Actions and Performance Outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The social dimension of sustainable development and its impact on supply chains have so far received less attention than the environmental dimension. The aim of the research is to explore the intersection between social issues, corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and performance outcomes. A structured literature review of social issues in supply chains is presented, analysing the research published so far in peer-reviewed publications. Linking CSR and supply chain management allows the exploration of strategies and performance outcomes with a focus on social issues. The corresponding responsible supply chain actions adopted by firms to address these issues are grouped into communication, compliance and supplier development strategies. Social and economic as well as buyer and supplier performance are identified as the key outcomes, but the interactions among these constructs would require further research. This paper contributes to the understanding of managing social issues in supply chains by linking social issues, responsible supply chain actions and performance outcomes. The paper consolidates related research by offering an overarching conceptual framework and points to future research directions and simultaneously provides insights into the management of social issues in supply chains.

TI Identifying Risks in the Cruise Supply Chain: An Empirical Study in
   Shanghai, China
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB The increased frequency and severe consequences of risks in the cruise industry have attracted increasing attention from both academics and practitioners, especially after the 2012 'Costa Concordia' disaster and the 2020 coronavirus outbreak on the 'Diamond Princess'. Although the literature on risk studies associated with the cruise industry and supply-chain risk management is growing, the extant literature lacks a study to view risks in the cruise industry associated with the supply chain. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing the literature on risks related to the cruise industry and general supply-chain risks to create a framework of cruise supply-chain risks. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted to validate the identified risks and explore potential undiscovered risks. A novel risk typology of the cruise supply chain was then built based on the literature review and the empirical study. This includes macro risks, safety, security, and health risks, information risks, and supply risks. This framework can be applied for the purpose of systematically identifying the risks and their impacts on the cruise supply chain. This paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive cruise supply-chain risk classification with a detailed explanation of each risk in the cruise supply chain, which can be used by stakeholders in the cruise industry to identify and measure the impact of each risk. Additionally, this paper provides avenues for future research by scholars interested in assessing and managing cruise supply-chain risks.

TI Integrating closed-loop principles in supply chains in emerging markets:
   The case of the Russian waste management industry
SO EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB The integration of closed-loop (CL) principles in supply chain management plays an important role for business and society. The CL supply chain can serve as a good example of an environment-friendly and sustainable solution because it assumes waste reduction and further usage in production. Hence, the notion of the CL supply chain is premised on the design, control and operation of a system that creates extra value using the entire product life cycle and capture value recovery from various returns over time. In practice, a successful integration of CL principles depends on many contextual factors. This study aimed to identify the factors that support and discourage CL supply chain innovations in emerging markets. The study employed institutional theory as theoretical background and conducted an in-depth case analysis of a Russian waste management company to present empirical evidence. The results showed that cooperation with an experienced and legitimate partner can drive the introduction of a CL initiative. Meanwhile, a low level of knowledge and trust might become a serious impediment. Thus, investment in knowledge dissemination and reputation building are crucial in an emerging market.

TI Comparative study of embodied energy of affordable houses made using
   GFRG and conventional building technologies in India
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The present situation vis-a-vis increased energy use and environmental emissions has urged the building sector to contribute more towards sustainable construction. This is possible only through appropriate choice of building materials and technologies that minimize the environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the adoption of the same need to necessarily satisfy the user in terms of aesthetics, utility and cost. This paper presents the comparison of embodied energy of a two-storey residential building, made using, i) GFRG (glass fibre reinforced gypsum), and, ii) load-bearing brick masonry, building technologies. GFRG technology uses load-bearing walls and slabs that are manufactured using gypsum waste, and consumes reduced quantity of reinforced concrete in comparison with conventional construction. It has been found in this study that the embodied energy related to building materials of the GFRG building is 16% less, and that associated with transport of resources is twice, compared to the conventional brick masonry building. The major advantages of the GFRG building construction are found to be about 1/4 reduction in structural weight and construction cost, 3/4 savings in construction time and 1/2 savings in total man power requirement for construction. Further, the use of cement, steel rebar and sand is reduced by 25%, 36% and 44% respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hypercompetitive aspects in the contemporary business environment, such as technological progress, changing customers' demands, economic cycles, and globalization, have the important influence in business organisation and supply chain in multinational companies and large enterprises. Supply chain occupies the enterprises with different information systems. The information infrastructure (II) presents a set of entirely new challenges regarding design and use compared to traditional information systems. This paper mainly investigates the II in organising agility end-to-end supply chain management (SCM). The proposed new II approach is based on good features in data warehouse environment. The proposed approach is not a final solution in great challenges in SCM; nevertheless, its application can easily improve agility and business performance.

TI Key Enablers of Resilient and Sustainable Construction Supply Chains: A
   Systems Thinking Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In the globalized world, one significant challenge for organizations is minimizing risk by building resilient supply chains (SCs). This is important to achieve a competitive advantage in an unpredictable and ever-changing environment. However, the key enablers of such resilient and sustainable supply chain management are less explored in construction projects. Therefore, the present research aims to determine the causality among the crucial drivers of resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects. Based on the literature review, 12 enablers of RSSCM were shortlisted. Using the systems thinking (ST) approach, this article portrays the interrelation between the 12 shortlisted resilience enablers crucial for sustainability in construction projects. The causality and interrelationships among identified enablers in the developed causal loop diagram (CLD) show their dynamic interactions and impacts within the RSSCM system. Based on the results of this study, agility, information sharing, strategic risk planning, corporate social responsibility, and visibility are the key enablers for the RSSCM. The findings of this research will enable the construction managers to compare different SCs while understanding how supply chain characteristics increase or decrease the durability and ultimately affect the exposure to risk in the construction SCs.

TI Nature inspired supply chain solutions: definitions, analogies, and
   future research directions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, and many companies and researchers are looking to nature for finding solutions. In this paper, we provide a narrative synthesis and systematic review to explore state-of-the-art, and identify key areas for exploration of nature inspired solutions in the supply chain area. We consider strategic, tactical, and operational decisions within supply chains and identify analogies between biological systems and supply chains to create a new research agenda. Our findings show that the majority of the research in nature inspired supply chains from the systemic perspective focuses on closed loop supply chains. In contrast, similar systemic solutions such as industrial symbiosis, circular economy, and industrial ecology have not been explored as frequently. Reducing production waste (industrial symbiosis) in addition to end-of-life product waste (closed loop supply chains), optimising raw material use and extending the life of used resources (circular economy), investigating the interactions between biosphere and technosphere (industrial ecology), and seeking solutions to industrial problems from nature (biomimicry) are all possible paths for reaching a zero-waste economy. These systemic solutions have a considerable impact on the supply chains at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels, which need to be explored to identify efficient and effective solutions.

TI Scottish Passive House: Insights into Environmental Conditions in
   Monitored Passive Houses
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Climate change and sustainability legislation in recent years has led to significant changes in construction approaches in the UK housing sector. This has resulted in the adoption of new building typologies, including the German Passivhaus (Passive House) standard. This standard aims to improve occupant comfort and energy efficiency, potentially changing the ways in which homes operate and how occupants interact with them. With increasing construction of low energy dwellings, there is an emerging gap in knowledge in relation to occupant health and wellbeing, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality (IAQ). Using data collected from a two year Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) study funded by Innovate UK, the environmental data (temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations) from five Certified Passive House homes in Scotland was compared. The results demonstrate problems with overheating with peak temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C. Imbalanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems were identified in 80% of the dwellings and inadequate IAQ was found due to poor ventilation. Only one of the Passive Houses studied exhibited thermal conditions and IAQ which were, on the whole within Passive House parameters. This paper outlines the insights and the main issues of Scottish Passive House in the broader context of sustainability.

TI Digital Twins on the Resilience of Supply Chain Under COVID-19 Pandemic
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put enormous pressure on the global supply chain. This work aims to solve supply chain interruption caused by public health emergencies in real life through the resilient supply chain based on digital twins (DTs). The research example used here is the disruption of the supply chain of N95 medical masks under the COVID-19 epidemic. First, the resilient supply chain's emergency decision cost and profit model is established under the manufacturer-supplier shared mode. The supply chain of M company of N95 medical masks in Hubei under the COVID-19 pandemic is selected to discuss the cost of emergency decision-making in the resilient supply chain. Moreover, a product supply chain model is built, including H suppliers, J manufacturers, K distributors, and L retailers. Supply failures result in lower supplier capacity ratios. Accordingly, the supply chain will adopt emergency strategies to reduce operating costs and increase profits. Activating alternative suppliers and distributors can mitigate the loss caused by partial supply chain disruption in emergencies. The elasticity of supply chains based on DTs discussed here is of significant value in helping the automation of critical links of the supply chain. The resilient supply chain combined with the capacity recovery strategy can significantly improve the traditional supply chain's response to supply disruption events.

TI Eco-efficient supply chain networks: development of a design framework
   and application to a real case study
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB This paper presents a supply chain network design framework that is based on multi-objective mathematical programming and that can identify eco-efficient' configuration alternatives that are both efficient and ecologically sound. This work is original in that it encompasses the environmental impact of both transportation and warehousing activities. We apply the proposed framework to a real-life case study (i.e. Lindt & Sprungli) for the distribution of chocolate products. The results show that cost-driven network optimisation may lead to beneficial effects for the environment and that a minor increase in distribution costs can be offset by a major improvement in environmental performance. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on eco-efficient supply chain design and closes the missing link between model-based methods and empirical applied research. It also generates insights into the growing debate on the trade-off between the economic and environmental performance of supply chains, supporting organisations in the eco-efficient configuration of their supply chains.

AB We analyze the incipient development of short supply chains for fresh fruit and vegetables from conventional agri-food chains, leading to the emergence of hybrid chains. We have sought to answer the research question of how and why hybrid food supply chains has been initiated by studying this phenomenon in south-eastern Spain. We analyzed the 20 main Spanish fruit and vegetable exporters, identifying the 9 that have developed short channels. Subsequently, we conducted a case study of the one considered most relevant, identifying the stages of this short chain, analyzing the tasks to be performed in the different phases of the SCS, studying which are common to both and where the differences in the processes arise. The results show the synergies that make them coexist successfully, such as the sharing of personnel, infrastructures and services, complementarity in the product range, thus avoiding food waste, or knowledge of consumer tastes and needs.

TI An Interaction Investigation of the Contributing Factors of the Bullwhip
   Effect Using a Bi-Level Social Network Analysis Approach

AB The bullwhip effect refers to the phenomenon of the increase in demand variability from supply chain downstream members to upstream members. This effect is critically important for the different sectors involved in a supply chain and is one of the main causes of inefficiency, material waste, and low sustainability in supply chain management. In order to help minimize the bullwhip effect and achieve sustainable development in a supply chain, this study identifies the influential factors of the bullwhip effect in a supply chain and the interactive relationships among them. A bi-level bullwhip effect analysis model was established to evaluate the causes of the bullwhip effect at different levels by using a social network analysis approach. Furthermore, to help achieve efficient and sustainable development, the implications of mitigating the impacts of the bullwhip effect in a supply chain were explored based on the results of the inter-relationships analysis among the contributing factors of the bullwhip effect.

TI Gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB The study was conducted to explore gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda. Specifically, it focused on characterizing local chicken value chain actors, ascertaining level and determinants of gender participation as well as relationships between gender, access and control over income from local chicken enterprises. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaires administered in a cross-sectional survey of 200 randomly selected local chicken value chain actors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 10 and StataSE 13 software from which simplified gross margins, descriptive statistics, correlations and a Logit regression model were estimated. Results revealed that majority of value chain actors were aged 20-48 years and males were dominant across most segments in the value chain. Men participated more in input supply, house construction, marketing and barbequing while women participated in production and stewing local chickens. Among actors, processors (UGX 1,911,274) and farmers (UGX 159,691) had the highest and least annual gross margin respectively. The Logit model revealed that age, education level, marital status and income control positively influenced (Pr=0.00) gender participation. Men had more control over income than women. An engendered innovation platform could be established for training and empowerment of local chicken value chain actors.

TI RFID-driven global supply chain and management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
AB Global supply chain and management has become an important issue. It involves a company's worldwide interests and the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation in the entire supply chain. In a global business environment, interoperability among information and information sharing among business partners are fundamental requirements. Capturing real-time data and information and gaining supply chain visibility can achieve quick responsiveness and high efficiency in business. RFID is powerful in these aspects and therefore can greatly foster the global Supply Chain Management (SCM) based on Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the EPCglobal Network. This paper describes the methodology and approach of using RFID to achieve optimised global supply chains. Problems, challenges, and new trends of RFID are also discussed.

AB One of an organization's significant challenges in a globalized world is reducing risk by building resilient supply chains (SCs). It is required to realize a competitive advantage in a volatile and fast changing environment. Conversely, the key enablers of such sustainable and resilient supply chain management are not fully analyzed in building projects. This study aims at determining the stationary enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains. For this to happen, a questionnaire survey comprising 32 enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains has been conducted with Egyptian engineers to appraise their degree of importance. The results show that the five most important enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains are: top management support, adaptability, visibility, quality awareness, and responsiveness. This research's results will allow building administrators to create diverse SCs, while being mindful of how the characteristics of a supply chain decrease or increase its resilience and eventually affect the exposure to risk in the building's SCs.

TI Passive Houses for different climate zones
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Passive Houses are buildings which provide comfortable indoor conditions at an extremely low heating and cooling load. The peak daily average heating and cooling loads are typically below 10 W/m(2) and annual useful energy demands are below 15 kW h/(m(2) a). The Passive House standard was originally developed in Germany. In this paper we show by hygro-thermal dynamic simulation that it is possible to realize residential Passive Houses in all of the world's relevant climate zones, represented here by Yekaterinburg, Tokyo, Shanghai, Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. The window quality, insulation levels, and mechanical services all depend on the climate as well as on the building's shape and orientation. The resulting annual energy demand for space conditioning of the Passive Houses is 75 to 95% lower than that of a traditionally insulated building of the same geometry. In humid climates like Shanghai or Singapore, special attention must be paid to humidity aspects. In climates which are hot and humid all year long, the total useful energy demand for sensible and latent cooling may exceed 70 kW h/(m2 a) even in a Passive House. Finally, it is shown that the architectural quality is not compromised by the Passive House requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results of these efforts have often disappointed in terms of quality, productivity, and sustainability issues. Firms need to take a strategic view of offshoring decisions emphasizing the role foreign production plays in their supply chain. Modern systems such as lean production require a tightly linked global supply chain. Lean production also fosters a sustainable global supply chain making practices such as sweatshop working conditions and environmental pollution incompatible and uneconomic.

TI Towards a global CO2 calculation standard for supply chains: Suggestions
   for methodological improvements
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Improving the efficiency and sustainability of supply chains is a shared aim of the transport industry, its customers, governments as well as industry organisations. To optimize supply chains and for the identification of best practice, standards for their analysis are needed in order to achieve comparable evaluations. This need for an evaluation standard also applies to CO2 emission calculations. This research focuses on the transportation within supply chains and possible approaches towards a global standard for calculating its CO2 emissions. In the recent past, several organisations, national and international, have come forward with possible methods, tools and databases for the calculation of CO2 emissions along supply chains, but almost all of them do not cover the entire transportation chain. Also standards for CO2 emissions of products and production in general do exist but they do not take the particular requirements of transportation into consideration. Therefore a global standard specifically for transportation could not yet be introduced. The EN 16258 standard is the only international standard for emission calculation of transportation in supply chains. It was therefore analyzed as a possible starting point for a global standardization approach. Analysis shows it too contains gaps and ambiguities which render comparisons of supply chains difficult. These gaps of the EN 16258 are analyzed, followed by suggestions for methodological improvements for their closure. The research concludes with an outlook on next steps needed towards a global CO2 calculation standard for transportation within supply chains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reduction of anthropogenic green house gas emissions through increased building energy efficiency is a global effort, which is a responsibility of both developed and developing nations The Passive House concept is a building design methodology that advocates for a systematic optimization and integration of the building envelope and internal loads in order to achieve a passive yet comfortable performance. Multiple passive houses have been built and monitored in Europe and the United States. The present paper attempts to determine what design features are required for tropical residential buildings to meet the Passive House Standard This study was conducted in El Salvador, which experiences a warm and humid climate throughout the year. For economic and cultural reasons, few residential buildings in the country have air conditioning systems However, the vast majority of residential buildings have not been designed using passive principles, causing great occupant discomfort and increasing energy consumption for cooling Both the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software and Energy Plus were used in order to determine the design parameters that would yield a passive house for this climate In addition, the paper discusses the technical and economic feasibility of modifying a typical house to meet the standard The potential benefits related to occupant comfort and energy cost savings are also discussed.

TI Digital technologies as enablers of supply chain sustainability in an
   emerging economy
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Vietnam is a country with significant potential for growth as a global centre for manufacturing, as supply chains look to reduce their over-reliance on China in the aftermath of COVID-19. The objective of this study is to better understand the current adoption rates and growth potential of emerging Industry 4.0 (I4.0) digital technologies and ascertain their potential to drive successful future sustainability initiatives amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms. These technologies offer a wide range of sustainability benefits, from a potential to reduce waste production and lower energy consumption to increased opportunities for recycling and industrial symbiosis. This empirical study surveys 223 Vietnamese supply chain experts to learn how digital technologies are being utilized in that region, what levels of future investment are expected, what preparatory measures are being taken to leverage new technologies, and what scope for improved supply chain sustainability exists. The findings indicate a low level of I4.0 digital technology adoption amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms, with the Internet of Things (IoT) currently being the most prevalent (48 percent adoption rate). Drones, Big Data Analytics and IoT are the I4.0 digital technologies expected to have the greatest future impact on Vietnamese supply chains. Whilst I4.0 digital technology adoption is still at this early stage, that may present a greater opportunity for driving future sustainability outcomes, than interrupting and retrofitting solutions to already-established networks and infrastructure.

   application to supply chain decisions
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainability recognizes the interdependence of ecological, social, and economic systems the three pillars of sustainability. The definition of corporate social responsibility (CSR) often advocates ethical behavior with respect to these systems. As more corporations Commit to sustainability and CSR policies, there is increasing pressure to consider social impacts throughout the supply chain. This paper reviews metrics, indicators, and frameworks of social impacts and initiatives relative to their ability to evaluate the Social sustainability of supply chains. Then, the relationship between business decision-making and social sustainability is explored with attention initially focused on directly impacting national level measures. A general strategy for considering measures of social sustainability is proposed, and a variety of indicators of CSR are described. Several of these indicators are then employed in art example to demonstrate how they may be applied to supply chain decision-making. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sustainability is a contributor to competitive advantage and a potential key to increase market shares in the saturated apparel sector. Managing supply chains environmentally and socially sustainable is a way to prevent from being associated with the many negative examples in the industry that are presented on a regular basis by NGOs and media. In order to avoid negative consequences from unsustainable behavior of suppliers, sustainability needs to be propagated to upstream partners in the supply chain.
   The paper at hand illustrates opportunities to strengthen sustainability in apparel supply chains Based on a systematic review of related literature, a taxonomy of apparel supply chains is derived and sustainability aspects are identified. A particular focus is put on finding alternative sources such as organic cotton from Africa.
   The presented study represents a basis to stimulate future research on sustainable apparel supply chains Practitioners may find innovative approaches to improve supply chain sustainability.

TI Evolutionary Game Analysis on Knowledge-Sharing Behavior in the
   Construction Supply Chain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB With the increasingly fierce global competition, supply chain members have to collaborate to respond to constant changes. Efficient knowledge sharing is the basis for the collaborative operation of the supply chain. Combined with evolutionary game theory, this paper studies the evolution path and stable strategies of knowledge-sharing behavior between construction supply chain enterprises, analyzing the factors that influence the establishment of a knowledge-sharing alliance. A numerical simulation is conducted to verify theoretical results and the effects of parameter adjustments on behavioral evolution. The results indicate that under different income relationships, knowledge-sharing behavior in construction supply chains presents different evolutionary trajectories. In addition, the probability of accepting the sharing strategy is positively correlated with the penalty coefficient, incentive coefficient, trust level, and synergy coefficient and negatively correlated with cost. This study provides a new perspective and theoretical guidance for establishing stable knowledge collaboration between enterprises and promoting the sustainable development of the construction supply chain.

TI Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Equilibrium Model with Subsidy on Green
   Supply Chain Technology Investment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The green supply chain (GSC) can effectively reduce the waste of resources and avoid environmental pollution. For a closed-loop supply chain network consisting of multiple manufacturers, multiple retailers, and multiple consumer and recycling markets, we assume that retailers are responsible for the recycling of used products, manufacturers use raw materials to produce new products and recycled products for remanufacturing, and government departments subsidize all manufacturers and retailers for GSC technology investment. Then, the equilibrium conditions of manufacturers, retailers, demand markets, and recycling markets are obtained by using the variational inequality method, complementarity theorem, and Nash equilibrium theory, and the variational inequality model of the closed-loop supply chain network multiphase equilibrium is established. Based on numerical simulation, the optimal technology investment decision of green supply chain under different government subsidy rates, and the influence of market structure and enterprise cost asymmetry on the equilibrium solution of supply chain network are analyzed. The results show that government subsidies can effectively promote enterprises to upgrade their level of GSC technology investment. The intensification of enterprise competition and the asymmetry of enterprise costs will affect the composition of enterprise profits and the allocation of profits between enterprises, and the former will weaken the effect of government subsidies.

TI Supply Chain Collaboration for Transparency
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB From an interdisciplinary theoretical perspective, this study uncovers how and to what extent building supply chain relations impacts supply chain transparency in an industrial context characterized by mistrust, complexity and privacy. By conducting a case study involving a multinational fashion group and an influential NGO, this study investigates how a fashion group forms supply chain relations that eventually influence their transparency performance. The fashion group under investigation initially started disclosing information about their supply chain actions in order to ensure legitimacy and protect the brand image. Nevertheless, the group started sharing more information about their supply chains, changing the perspective from a legitimacy driven reactive approach toward an ethics driven proactive approach. Particularly, supplier engagement, commitment and leadership appear to be antecedents to supply chain transparency. The study also reveals the novel influence of NGOs on supply chain transparency. Fashion Revolution has been substantial to drive fashion companies to obtain and disclose information about their supply chains. Supply chain visibility and stronger partnerships are required to overcome problems relating to supply chain complexity on the way toward transparency. Results suggest that supply chain engagement is fundamental for supply chain transparency, and that NGOs play a pivotal role to enhance transparency through knowledge sharing and awareness increasing. The results provide numerous implications that can help industrial practice and research improve the status quo.

TI Frugal supply chains: a managerial and societal perspective
SO SOCIETY AND BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Purpose The paper aims to introduce the issue of supply chain management in the context of increasingly rare and costly resources and to define the notion of frugal supply chain, in particular, in reference to the development of circular economy. The challenges of frugal supply chain are detailed for a set of private and public stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach As a programmatic viewpoint, this paper aims at developing debates regarding the future of supply chains, building upon current technical and managerial innovations. Findings Frugal supply chains constitute a new business perspective. It transforms the way value creation process is considered, in reference to the models of circular economy, and the systems in which companies evolve. The circular economy represents many opportunities for new forms of growth in the context of rare resources, and it raises several challenges for a variety of stakeholders, more or less, involved in the management of closed loop supply chains. Practical implications - Frugal strategies in a supply chain context may provide both a source of competitive advantage for companies and an enhancement of their commitment to society. Social implications - The practices described in the paper aim at stimulating a new view of logistics management, based on the principles of sustainable development. Frugal supply chains offer the possibility of reflecting on a more moderate, sensible and effective use of several commons by taking part in the conservation of rare resources for future generations. Originality/value This viewpoint introduces the concept of frugal supply chains, rarely approached in the literature, and it offers the opportunity to open debates on managerial and societal challenges linked to logistics strategies and, more broadly, to inter-organizational relations.

TI Multi-tier supply chain sustainability in the pulp and paper industry: a
   framework and evaluation methodology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The pulp and paper industry has significant sustainability implications and necessarily requires a careful consideration of direct and lower-tier suppliers for effective sustainable supply chain management. This paper utilized an extensive literature review and semi-structured interviews of experts in the Chinese pulp and paper industry to unearth the factors that highly influence multi-tier supply chain sustainability. A Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) and Human-Organizational-Technological (HOT-fit) based theoretical framework was employed to classify the identified factors. Then, an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based methodology was applied to determine the relative importance of the factors. A comparison analysis of the relative importance of the factors as determined by the experts in the focal companies, Tier-1 suppliers and Tier-2 suppliers of the Chinese pulp and paper industry is presented. The results show that institutional and technological factors are most critical to actualizing multi-tier supply chain sustainability. Thus, the study outcomes present relevant theoretical and practical implications for the managers and practitioners in the pulp and paper industry on how to facilitate multi-tier supply chain sustainability for increased competitiveness. Furthermore, this study provides guidelines for other industries as well and sets the stage for subsequent theorization and exploration of multi-tier supply chain sustainability for expected performance gains.

AB The projected increase in global energy consumption, along with recent upheavals such as extreme weather events due to climate change and geopolitical turmoil, motivates the development of sustainable energy supply chains that have the capability to withstand internal and external threats to the system. However, one major challenge is a lack of understanding on the contributing factors to energy supply chain resilience at various spatial and temporal scales. To this end, we argue for the use of a multi-scale approach in studying the resilience of energy supply chains to take advantage of physical and chemi-cal synergies at various scales of operation as well as incorporate risk mitigation techniques drawn from general supply chain literature and practice. We present an initial effort towards a framework for energy supply chain resilience at four scales of operation: molecular, unit, process, and supply chain.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Interrupting Inequality Through Community Land Trusts
SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB Relying on market-based housing policies has been inadequate to meet the need for affordable and sustainable housing and has heightened disparities in the housing system, especially along lines of race and gender. Community land trusts (CLTs) promise more equitable ways of providing stable, secure, and affordable housing for those marginalized in market-based housing. Yet there has been limited research comparing CLT housing with mainstream tenures. Using data from the first sample survey of CLT owners (N = 216) that includes comparison groups of market owners (N = 142) and renters (N = 130) drawn from similar low- and moderate-income populations, we find that those who purchase CLT homes are similar demographically to renters but compared with market owners are more likely to be Black and from households headed by women. We find no difference between CLT and market-rate homeowners in terms of benefits often attributed to homeownership, specifically financial well-being, stability, and a sense of house as home. CLT owners report having more time and resources to pursue desired activities than do market owners. Despite their demographic similarity to CLT owners, renters fare worse on all of these dimensions. We conclude with policy recommendations for housing tenures that provide permanent affordability, greater social equality and greater democratic resident control.

TI Issue on supply chain of renewable energy
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Actually, one of the most relevant debates, among both citizens that government, is related to energy and environmental issue. The development of renewable energy usage is due to several factors such as the political strategic decisions and geographical situation.
   Indeed the high development of renewable energies requires challenges from a supply chain point of view. In this paper, a thorough survey of the extant literature on the topic of supply chain (SC) and renewable energy (RE) has been conducted. English papers published on international peer-reviewed journals from 2003 to 2013 have been considered.
   Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) resolves the duality between environmental, economic and social aspects. Sustainable manufacturing practices play an essential role in promoting renewable energy development and commercialization; this will require significant changes to the industry's traditional Supply Chain Management and business model. The aim of the paper is investigate literature insights useful to increase the performance and overcome barriers to the RE supply chain development.
   Like many typical supply chains, also supply chain related to RE includes elements such as: physical, information, and financial flows. The present research is useful to individualize characteristics of a RE supply chain. Moreover, the research is useful improve the performance of RE supply chain in some aspects like:
   better control supply chain costs to make renewable energy more affordable;
   manage supply chain to address weakened demand in the near term, and increase flexibility to handle anticipated rapid growth in the next 3-5 years;
   In so doing the present research has practical implications that make the results interesting for decision maker about optimal design of a system operating from one renewable energy sources. Moreover, the results are interesting for researchers since are individualized many sectors where it is necessary to proceed with additional research investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI From a literature review to a conceptual framework for sustainable
   supply chain management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Academic and corporate interest in Sustainable supply chain management has risen considerably in recent years. This can be seen by the number of papers published and in particular by journal special issues. To establish the field further, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it offers a literature review on sustainable supply chain management taking 191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. Second, it offers a conceptual framework to summarize the research in this field comprising three parts. As starting point related triggers are identified. This allows putting forward two distinct strategies: (1) supplier management for risks and performance, and (2) Supply chain management for sustainable products. it is evident that research is still dominated by green/environmental issues. Social aspects and also the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability are still rare. Both practitioners in companies and academics might find the review useful, as it outlines major lines of research in the field. Further, it discusses specific features of sustainable supply chains as well as limitations of existing research; this should stimulate further research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Extraction and Analysis of Technical Management Factors for Passive
   Houses in Korea
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Construction projects are diverse, ranging from industrial infrastructure to residential facilities, and all of these consume energy during operation and maintenance. From this perspective, passive houses can serve as a green housing model for energy-savings. However, Koreans have not actively adopted passive houses in domestic construction compared to other countries, since the energy cost savings are low compared to construction costs. This study extracts the technical management factors in domestic passive house building through a review of the related literature and a focus group interview (FGI) of relevant experts. Additionally, the relative importance of the 6 high-level management factors and 22 low-level factors was analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results show that the most important items relate to the performance of the construction materials and the techniques used in construction. The results should help further the development of a passive house model and technical management tailored for the Korean market.

TI CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUPPLY CHAIN DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES,
   TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
SO MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING REVIEW
AB The aim of this study is to empirically examine the impact of supply chain dynamic capabilities on operational performance, and the mediating effect of technological innovation between dynamic capabilities and operational performance. This study is based on empirical data collected from a survey of 206 small- and medium-size firms in Korea. Structural equation modeling is used to test the research questions. The results show that supply chain dynamic capabilities positively influence technological innovation and operational performance of an enterprise. Additionally, structural equation analyses reveal that technological innovation plays a role as a partial mediator of the relationship between supply chain dynamic capabilities and operational performance. In a dynamic and ever-changing environment, the enforcement of dynamic capabilities in a sustainable supply chain is important for the innovation of technology and the improvement of operational performance. Further investigation is required to understand the differences by industries, characteristics of enterprises, and positions in a supply chain.

TI Supply chain social sustainability: Standard adoption practices in
   Portuguese manufacturing firms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Firms are increasingly under pressure to incorporate social sustainability practices into their operations and supply chain management strategies. The purpose of this research is to develop a taxonomy of the supply chain social sustainability (SCSS) practices adopted by firms. The methodology involves two steps. First, the taxonomy is built based on literature review. Second, our empirical analysis, using non-financial (sustainability) reports with a sample of 55 listed companies, identifies standard adoption practices. We used content analysis software to unearth the influential words in the sustainability reports from different industries, sizes, and geographical regions. The content analysis reveals three different themes that provide a snapshot of how Portuguese firms integrate social sustainability into their supply chain and operations. Firms emphasize diverse facets of social sustainability practices in upstream and downstream supply chain based on different industries. The results assume significance and provide unique insights on adoption practices to supply chain practitioners who otherwise have no information on what constitutes supply chain social sustainability in this region.

TI The Influence of Digital Transformation and Supply Chain Integration on
   Overall Sustainable Supply Chain Performance: An Empirical Analysis from
   Manufacturing Companies in Morocco
SO ENERGIES
AB This study examined the association between digital transformation (DT), supply chain integration (SCI), and overall sustainable supply chain performance (OSSCP). The current literature has preliminarily explored the concepts of DT and SCI and their relationship with sustainable supply chain performance. However, real empirical evidence of the direct impact of DT and SCI on OSSCP has been missing so far. To fill this gap, data were collected from 134 professionals working in international manufacturing companies operating in Morocco through a questionnaire-based survey from August 2022 to November 2022. A conceptual framework was developed based on DT, SCI, and OSSCP and analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with the assistance of SmartPLS 4.0 software. The findings revealed that DT has a significant positive influence on SCI and OSSCP. Furthermore, SCI directly and positively impacts OSSCP with a partial mediation effect on the relationship between DT and OSSCP. Further, this research provides insights for practitioners into enhancing sustainable supply chain performance by adopting digital technologies and integrating SC functions. In particular, this study revealed that DT adoption drives a higher ethical supply chain level from the perspective of sustainability and efficiency in operations. This study is the first to analyze the influence of digital transformation and supply chain integration on sustainable supply chain performance in a manufacturing context.

TI Sustainable supply chains for supply chain sustainability: impact of
   sustainability efforts on supply chain risk
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Supply chain managers across the globe are finding it difficult to manage the increasingly complex supply chains despite adopting a variety of risk mitigation strategies. Firms on the other hand have also been adopting various kinds of environmental and social sustainability practices in recent times to reduce carbon footprint and improve their image on the social front. However, very few studies in the extant literature have examined the impact of sustainability practices on supply chain risk. We address this important gap in literature by empirically testing this relationship, using primary data from six manufacturing sectors and 21 different countries including developed as well as emerging markets across the globe. Our findings indicate that risk mitigation strategies do not always reduce the actual supply chain risk experienced by firms, whereas sustainability efforts help reduce supply chain risk, especially in emerging market contexts. In addition, we find that, while reactive risk mitigation strategies on their own fail to reduce supply chain risk, they are effective when used in conjunction with sustainability efforts. We also find that preventive risk mitigation efforts are only effective in mature supply chains such as the OECD countries.

TI Sustainable Circular Business Model for Transparency and Uncertainty
   Reduction in Supply Chain Management
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM) incorporates the economy concept into supply chain concepts, which gives the supply chain sustainability domain an innovative and convincing viewpoint. The challenging factors in the circular economy are cooperation, trust, and transparency. Therefore, to achieve sustainable results, collaboration, and openness between organizations within networks and value chains are required. This paper explores the sustainability success using the Sustainable Circular Business Model (SCBM) to incorporate the principle at an operational level and suggest a structure for combining Circular Business Model (CBM) and CSCM for sustainable growth. The proposed structure shows how various circular business structures power the global supply chain in multiple loops. The circular business models differ according to the difficulty of the Circular Supply Chain (CSC) and the value proposition. Proposed SCBM shows that circular market and supply chain aid in reaching goals for sustainability has been discussed in this research.

TI A blockchain-based approach for a multi-echelon sustainable supply chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology is destined to revolutionise supply chain processes. At the same time, governmental and regulatory policies are forcing firms to adjust their supply chains in response to environmental concerns. The objective of this study is therefore to develop a distributed ledger-based blockchain approach for monitoring supply chain performance and optimising both emission levels and operational costs in a synchronised fashion, producing a better outcome for the supply chain. We propose the blockchain approach for different production allocation problems within a multi-echelon supply chain (MESC) under a carbon taxation policy. As such, we couple recent advances in digitalisation of operations with increasingly stringent regulatory environmental policies. Specifically, with lead time considerations under emission rate constraints (imposed by a carbon taxation policy), we simultaneously consider the production, distribution and inventory control decisions in a production allocation-based MESC problem. The problem is then formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model. We show that the distributed ledger-based blockchain approach minimises both total cost and carbon emissions. We then validate the feasibility of the proposed approach by comparing the results with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The findings provide support for policymakers and supply chain executives alike.

TI Assessing supply chain greenness from the perspective of embodied
   renewable energy-A data envelopment analysis using multi-regional
   input-output analysis
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Previous assessments for the sustainability of global supply chains have mostly focused on the single environmental aspect, that is, the accounting of pollutant leakage. Considering that the impact of supply chain on sustainability is transnational and multi-dimensional, this study proposes a supply chain green degree assessment method based on multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed method integrates economic and environmental factors embodied in the supply chains into a green-degree indicator, while taking into account the constraints of energy consumption structure. Based on this method, we account for the renewable and non-renewable energy consumption embodied in global supply chains and measure the supply chains green-degree. The results show that 27% of renewable energy is consumed in the cross-border production of goods and services, and the participation of renewable energy in global supply chains is increasing. The green-degree of the current global supply chains is quite low, with an average score of only 0.45. The outsourcing of production and processing activities has made developed economies' supply chains "less clean", and their green-degree has dropped by 5.3% between 2000 and 2014, while the emerging developing economies' have become cleaner, and their green-degree has increased by 10.5%.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Today's manufacturing-based small and medium enterprises (SME) face the need to implement green supply chains more efficiently in order to overcome environmental barriers in increasingly competitive markets and to improve financial performance. This study examines the structural relationship between environmental collaboration, green innovation capacity, and performance based on the findings of previous studies in order to identify the factors affecting the green supply chain management (GSCM) performance of Korean manufacturing-based SMEs. The study finds that environmental collaboration in the green supply chain environment is an important driver of green innovation capacity for manufacturing-based Korean SMEs. It also finds that green innovation capacity has a positive effect on financial performance through environmental performance. This study establishes a theoretical basis for the systematic study of the structural mechanisms of green supply chains and suggests strategic directions for manufacturing-based SMEs' successful GSCM implementation.

TI Factors affecting sustainability-oriented innovation in the leather

SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB A sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) in the leather-making process is key for inducing a sustainable shift in the leather supply chain. Fashion is an industry that is highly vulnerable to sustainability disruptions and, at the same time, as a fertile ground for SOIs. As a result of increasing pressures from the market, several fashion brands have started to recognize the potential of SOIs to induce a positive transformation for the whole supply chain. The present paper discusses the case of a SOI in the leather industry by analyzing the perception of different actors in the leather-accessories supply chain with three theoretical lenses. Findings suggest that focal companies should pay attention to how to manage their business relationships with supply chain actors and leverage positive and collaborative relationships rather than using coercive methods to extend sustainability along the supply chain.

TI Comparison of passive house construction types using analytic hierarchy
   process
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB In this study, in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the most common construction materials, different constructions types for passive houses, such as solid wood, wood-frame, aerated concrete, and brick, were compared with each other. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a widely used multi-criteria method, was applied to quantify the comparison. The analysis of different construction types based on quantifying different criteria for passive houses was performed on a case study. The AHP analysis revealed that the highest ranking criteria came into play here, notably well-being, the psychological aspect, and functionality in the wood construction considered as one of the most suitable options for passive houses. The AHP analysis can help professionals and future dwellers to make a reasonable choice on further optimizing and developing a particular aspect of the building process by giving them the possibility of comparing different alternatives on a common and comprehensive basis. In the light of the growing importance of energy-efficient building methods, it could be said that wood construction would play an increasingly important role in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Affordable Housing for Emiratis in the United Arab Emirates: The Case
   Study of Ras Al Khaimah
SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB Adequate and affordable housing is a basic human need, and in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a federation composed of seven emirates, housing is treated as a constitutional right of every Emirati national. Using interviews with municipal and housing officials and a survey of the housing beneficiaries, the study evaluates the efficacy of the two national housing programs in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah that provide subsidies for affordable homeownership-the Sheikh Zayed Housing Program and the President's Initiative. The study found that the UAE is shifting back to a provider approach to housing for its citizens. The program beneficiaries seemed satisfied with the design of their homes but raised concerns about their locations. The locations and growth spurred by the two programs have significantly shaped the current sprawling urban form of the Ras Al Khaimah municipality. The question of the long-term sustainability of the two programs looms large, funded as they are entirely by the government, with limited participation from the private, nonprofit, or informal sectors. To make housing programs financially and environmentally sustainable, every stakeholder must play a role: the federal government, the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, the Ras Al Khaimah Municipality, and the individual program beneficiaries.

TI Strategic measures for enhancing resiliency in knowledge base supply
   chains: an emerging economy perspective
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB In the disruptive environment, the supply chains are unpredictable, volatile, and complex. By effectively applying knowledge, information, data, human intelligence, and new technologies, businesses with knowledge-based supply chains may successfully navigate the disruptive environment. This study has made an attempt to identify and evaluate the challenging factors that essential for knowledge-based supply chains to attain resilience. Due to the high effectiveness in determining the relationship among the factors, the study used the Fuzzy DEMATEL methodology. A total of 25 factors from the literature review were explored and validated by expert's judgement to be grouped as causal and effect group variables. The Fuzzy DEMATEL results exhibit that digital technologies-based supply chains, agility, green perspective, personalization, last mile delivery, e-Procurement, mentoring & coaching for knowledge retention are the significant causal factors to be considered by the knowledge-based supply chains. Furthermore, the strategic measures are investigated and evaluated using the Best-Worst Method (BWM) application, which reveals that the two most important strategic solutions that have the potential to improve resilience in knowledge-based supply chains are a focus on socially sustainable supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The report can help businesses think through important methods for long-term resilience.

TI Outcome-Driven Supply Chain Perspective on Dry Ports
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The hinterland leg of maritime containerized transport as a part of supply chain has been increasingly pressured by larger volumes, as well as by a need to fulfill sustainability requirements that are expressed by social opinion and formal regulations. There is a potential to relieve this pressure through integration of a dry port, as a seaport's inland interface, in the supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to explain how a supply chain can benefit or enhance its outcomes of cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation, by the integration of a dry port. The data for this case study is collected through interviews and site visits from the privately owned Skaraborg dry port, Sweden; and the study is limited to the actors of the transport system involved in the development and operations of the dry port integrated setup. The results show that the six supply chain outcomes (cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation) are perceived by the actors as being desirable, and can be enhanced by the integration of a dry port in the supply chains. In particular, the enhancement of the supply chain outcomes can be achieved due to intermodality and reliability of rail transportation and customization of services associated with the dry port integrated setup, and by increasing the capacity of transportation system.

TI Supply chain network design with multi-time-period stochastic demands
   for optimizing dual objectives on economic and environmental factors
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS
AB Traditional supply chain management focuses on operational and financial factors, such as improving operational efficiency and reducing cost. Since global warming has become critical, researchers and managers of the supply chain have paid more attention to environmental issues. With the environmental factor, the complexity in designing an optimal supply chain network essentially increases. This research considers a multi-objective (minimal total cost and CO2 emissions) supply chain network design with environmental factor (SCNDEF), which includes the features of multiple echelons, stochastic demands, production/storage capacity, environmental investment, and multiple time periods. In order to help managers make decisions about the SCNDEF, this research performs sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of key parameters, such as customers? satisfaction level and limits on CO2 emissions, on the performance of the supply chain network. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that a good SCNDEF can not only improve the performance of the entire supply chain but also achieve sustainable environmental protection. These research findings are intended to serve as practical reference for industry.

SE Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy
AB We live in a time when energy is becoming more precious. Worldwide energy resources are finite and they seem to be running out faster than expected. At this time when energy consumption is rising dramatically in the emerging markets, the opposition to nuclear energy, which in fact cannot be any solution to dwindling energy resources while open security issues are not resolved, is growing. On 30 June 2011, the federal government of Germany decided by law Germany's final exit from nuclear energy no later than 31 December 2022. There is also the problem of climate change. We will have to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere dramatically if we want to preserve tolerable conditions of life on planet earth 'for which there are no spare parts' (Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of Potsdam Climate Institute). The biggest challenge of our time is to minimise worldwide energy consumption. The 'Passive House Standard' is the worldwide acknowledged leading standard in energy-saving building. Building to the Passive House Standard is one answer to the most important questions of our time. The chapter supplies answers to the questions: 'Why build to the Passive House Standard?', 'What is a Passive House?' and 'How do Passive Houses work?', and outlines planning approaches.

TI Decision-making and coordination of green closed-loop supply chain with
   fairness concern
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper considers a green closed-supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. A Stackelberg game model of centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making with manufac-turer's fairness concern was constructed based on the consideration of retailer's sales effort. The decision-making of supply chain members under the above two situations and their reasons are analyzed in depth. According to the model, a green closed-loop supply chain with profit sharing contract coordination fairness is designed. Finally, the correctness of the model is verified by numerical simulation. We generate our findings from three aspects, as follows: when the manufacturer has fair concern behavior, it is not conducive to the environmental performance of green products, resulting in waste of resources, but also forcing retailers to reduce sales efforts and increase the retail price of products. Finally, the benefits of green closed-loop supply chain are seriously damaged. The profit-sharing contract could improve the relationship between members of the supply chain to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The supply chain management strategy evolves increasingly and includes new areas and issues. The requirements of the sustainable development and its principles are also present in this field. The practical reflection of these ideas in the supply chain is the creation of sustainable and green supply chains. This task includes many activities at both the operational and strategic level. Also in the coordination and implementation of ideas on the level of the whole chain and in participating units which determine a challenge for the managers. The legal, organizational, social, environmental, and economic requirements in the field of sustainability have a huge impact on the supply chains. One of the fundamental processes in the chain is the transportation. It is therefore important to research the role of transport, above all, because of the cost of the construction and operation of the green supply chains. The attention was focused primarily on aspects of cost and organizational activities in the field of the transportation in the green supply chain.

TI Determinants of Supply Chain Engagement in Carbon Management
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB To fight climate change, firms must adopt effective and feasible carbon management practices that promote collaboration within supply chains. Engaging suppliers and customers on carbon management reduces vulnerability to climate-related risks and increases resilience and adaptability in supply chains. Therefore, it is important to understand the motives and preconditions for pursuing supply chain engagement from companies that actively engage with supply chain members in carbon management. In this study, a relational view is applied to operationalize the supply chain engagement concept to reflect the different levels of supplier and customer engagement. Based on a sample of 345 companies from the Carbon Disclosure Project's supply chain program, the determinants of engagement were hypothesized and tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic estimation methods. The results indicate that companies that integrate climate change into their strategies and are involved in developing environmental public policy are driven by moral motives to engage their suppliers and customers in carbon management. All these factors make a stronger impact on supplier engagement than on customer engagement. Moreover, companies operating in greenhouse gas-intensive industries are driven by instrumental motives to engage their suppliers and customers because increasing greenhouse gas intensity positively influences engagement level. Company profitability appears to increase supplier engagement, but not customer engagement. Interestingly, operating in a country with stringent environmental regulations does not appear to influence supply chain engagement. By utilizing relational capabilities and collaboration, buyers can increase their suppliers' engagement to disclose emissions, which ultimately will lead to better results in carbon management.

AB As the global warming has been accelerated, many countries make efforts to expand the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. The energy consumption in building takes over around 30 similar to 40% in many countries. The energy reduction of building is very urgent for the global energy efficiency. As these efforts, low energy houses', 'passive houses', 'zero-energy houses', and 'energy-plus houses' have been researched and constructed in the field of architecture. The Korean governmenthasalso planned to build passive houses in 2017, zero energy houses in 2025 for all new residences. Even there is no standard for Passive House in Korea though, the criteria of insulation are weaker than the Passive House's. On this study, domestic and Passive House regulationwere compared. Base on the comparison, the analysis of the thermal loads was performed by VE(Virtual Environment) simulation tool through application of Passive House regulation into Korean standard model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the insulation standard in Korea to achieve the goals of passive house as adata base.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the integrated model of the Preference Selection Index (PSI) and the prospect theory as new means to appraise the impact of supply chain sustainability risks based on five pillars of sustainability. Research has shown that sustainability risk assessment has a strong positive impact on improving the performance of enterprises. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a new decision support model for assessing supply chain sustainability risk based on additional failure mode and effect analysis parameters and its integration with PSI methodology and prospect theory. A case example of the supply chain small and medium enterprise (SME) producing fashion have been used in this study. Findings The result of this study reveals some critical supply chain sustainability risks affecting the sustainability of enterprises under study. Research limitations/implications The use of a limited sample is often associated as a limitation in the research studies and this study is based on findings from SMEs in the fashion retail supply chain. This preliminary study provides academics and practitioners an exemplar of supply chain sustainability risk assessment using integration of the PSI method and prospect theory. Practical implications The result of this study is beneficial for practitioners, particularly owner-managers of SMEs who can use this study as guidance on how to consider risk behavior to identify and select the critical sustainability risks and plan mitigating strategies accordingly. Originality/value Scientific studies on using the PSI and its integration with prospect theory as means to assess the criticality of supply chain sustainability risks is very rare. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that presents the integrated model of the PSI and prospect theory to rank supply chain sustainability risks based on five pillars of sustainability.

TI The building envelope in the rehabilitation of affordable housing

SO ACE-ARCHITECTURE CITY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper studies the rehabilitation of the residential building envelope in urban affordable housing estates built between the forties and the seventies of the twentieth century. The state and functioning of the envelope of this vulnerable building condition its stability, habitability, energy efficiency and architectural identity, with its effect on the balanced development of the city. The research is carried out by assessing one of the first urban rehabilitations that have been completed in Spain, in the Poblado Dirigido de Cano Roto, Madrid, between 1994 and 2004. The methodology used raises a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the functional adequacy of the thermal envelope prior to rehabilitation, which results in a diagnosis, and at the current time, which allows an evaluation. Both states are structured in a study of the enclosure structured in the roof, facade and floor, according to the definition of thermal envelope issued by the Spanish Technical Building Code (Codigo Tecnico de la Edificacion) and applying its scales to obtain an objective and current evaluation. The systematic study of the envelope improvement confirms that the rehabilitation process has achieved optimal parameters, which contribute to the renovation of the urban housing stock, but it implies the alteration of its image with the consequent loss of heritage value or architectural interest. This result leads to question the guidelines and principles of these operations, and the need of their own regulations.

SE Economic Complexity and Evolution
AB Due to the dependency on crude oil, mitigating, greenhouse gas emissions, energy and food security, support for rural economic development and the effort for environmental sustainability, renewable energy sources become more and more important. This led to an increasing research on biomass-based supply chains in recent years. Conventional supply chains, i.e., the commodity flow including all the stakeholders from the supplier to the end customer, have been studied intensively in the past. Biomass-based supply chains, however, feature different characteristics and uncertainties that have to be considered. In this paper, we identify the differences between the two types of supply chains and elaborate the stakeholders involved in the supply chain process and the different planning tasks structured according to the functional areas. As several possible pathways from feedstocks to different end-products exist, we focus on bio-fuels as the final product. We conclude by reviewing the literature that deals with supply chain optimization using operations research (OR) models to present the relevant planning tasks in biomass-based supply chains.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB From farm to fork, food supply chains threaten the environment in a range of different ways. Stake-holders in food chains seeking to go green have a twofold problem, comprising limited resources and too many eco-options to choose from. Hence, this study aims to narrow the field of such options, based on a careful assessment of past successful choices when going green. Specifically, it utilizes business analytics to derive insights on food supply chains' environmental sustainability from numerous data sources, and transforms this intricate information into managerial knowledge of food supply chains in general, and sustainable food supply chains in particular. The analytical results reveal eight crucial characteristics of sustainable food supply chains: devices/software, eco-innovation, organizational culture, warehousing, transportation, food loss/waste, equipment, and regulation. Among these, the two most important drivers of successful sustainability implementation are found to be eco-innovation and food loss/waste. Lastly, this study applies relational view theory and natural resource based view theory to the analytical results to create new sustainable food chain strategies and to extend the application of those theories to sustainable food chain management.

AB Any major crisis such as the latest coronavirus disease pandemic will have a monumental effect on the worldwide economy and on the international supply chain. Much of the global supply chain relies on China, Germany, and the United States for manufacturing and distribution; this fragile system is subject to failure. Climactic changes in demand and rapid shortages in necessities are the results of the pandemic's disruption. The recovery forecast for the ongoing pandemic is uncertain and, therefore, any recovery effort will need to be adaptable to build the supply chain resiliency. A wide adoption of flexible smart automated technologies in the manufacturing sector are helping to build robust supply chains and assisting in recovery. In this work, a brief discussion of these smart manufacturing technologies is presented, along with a list of potential supply chain issues and corresponding solutions. Such smart manufacturing technologies possess the potential to empower and revolutionize the traditional manufacturing environment by enhancing its resiliency and flexibility. These smart technologies will play a crucial role in accelerating the worldwide supply chain recovery in and after a pandemic.

TI Stability Governance of E-commerce Supply Chain: Social Capital and
   Governance Mechanism Design Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The supply chain is an important part for firms to maintain competitive advantages. With the development of the Internet industry, the complexity of the business environment faced by E-commerce firms has greatly increased. Additionally, unexpected events have occurred from time to time, which have seriously affected the stability of the E-commerce supply chain. Supply chain social capital comprises the resources obtained by firms in the supply chain network through reputation, status, trust, commitment, etc., which allows the firms in the supply chain to form an interdependent relationship. Supply chain social capital can generate sustainable competitive advantages for supply chain firms. Based on the theory of social capital, this paper analyzes the impact on supply chain collaboration and stability from the three dimensions of supply chain capital: structural capital, cognitive capital, and relational capital. The results show that supply chain social capital positively affects supply chain collaboration and affects the stability of the supply chain in indirect ways. At the same time, this paper also found that under different supply chain governance modes, there are differences in the relationship between supply chain social capital and supply chain collaboration, that the moderation effects of contractual governance are not significant, while relational governance has positive moderation effects on the relationship between supply chain structural capital, relational capital, and supply chain collaboration. The conclusion of this study provides a theoretical basis for E-commerce firms to improve the level of supply chain social capital, adopt informal relational governance to face market uncertainty, and then promote the stability of the supply chain. At the same time, it also provides practical reference for the management department to issue policies so as to promote mutual understanding between supply chain cooperative firms, and to form a harmonious supply chain relationship.

TI A supply chain transparency and sustainability technology appraisal
   model for blockchain technology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology is a technology that can effectively support supply chain transparency. An important initial managerial activity is for organisations in supply chains to evaluate and select the most suitable blockchain technology. However, uncertainty and emphasis on sustainable transparency has made this appraisal more complex. This paper: (1) introduces blockchain technology performance measures incorporating various sustainable supply chain transparency and technical attributes; and (2) introduces a new hybrid group decision method, integrated hesitant fuzzy set and regret theory, for blockchain technology evaluation and selection. This method emphasises decision maker psychological characteristics and variation in decision maker opinions. An illustrative application and sensitivity analysis is introduced to aid supply chain managers and researchers understand the blockchain technology selection decision. Methodological and managerial implications associated with the decision tool and application are introduced. This research sets the foundation for significant future research in blockchain technologies evaluation in a supply chain environment.

TI Machine learning-based technique for predicting vendor incoterm
   (contract) in global omnichannel pharmaceutical supply chain
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The importance of supply chain management to business operations and social growth cannot be overstated. Modern supply chains are considerably dissimilar from those of only a few years ago and are still evolving in a vastly competitive environment. Technology dealing with the rising complexity of dynamic supply chain processes is required. Robotics, machine learning, and rapid information dispensation can be supply chain transformation enablers. Quite a few functional supply chain applications based on Machine Learning (ML) have appeared in recent years; however, there has been minimal research on applications of data-driven techniques in pharmaceutical supply chains. This paper proposes a machine learning-based vendor incoterm (contract) selection model for direct drop-shipping in a global omnichannel pharmaceutical supply chain. The study also highlights the critical factors influencing the decision to select a vendor incoterm during the shipment of pharmaceutical goods. The findings of this study show that the proposed model can accurately predict a vendor incoterm (contract) for given values of input parameters. This comprehensive model will enable researchers and business administrators to undertake innovation initiatives better and redirect the resources regarding the direct drop shipping of pharmaceutical products.

TI Optimal Pricing and Green Product Design Strategies in a Sustainable
   Supply Chain Considering Government Subsidy and Different Channel Power
   Structures
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green product design is a vital measure to support sustainable development in a circular economy era. This paper studies the multi-product pricing and green product design strategies under different supply chain structures and government subsidy strategies. Considering different channel leadership, we establish the centralized (C), manufacturer-led (MS), and retailer-led (RS) supply chain models, respectively. By applying a game-theoretical approach, corresponding equilibrium pricing, green product design, and government subsidy decisions under different supply chain structures are obtained. Through comparison and numerical analysis, we find that: (1) the different subsidy strategies of the government have an important impact on green product development. When the government provides a uniform subsidy strategy, a RS supply chain can bring greener product, more market demands, more profit, and more social welfare; (2) when the government provides a differentiated subsidy strategy, MS and RS supply chain structures can bring greener product and more market demand than the centralized supply chain. They can also bring the same social welfare and the same product to the green design level. However, the MS supply chain structure can bring more profit for the firm; (3) the consumers' green awareness positively impacts the design and development of green product. Therefore, it is beneficial for the firm to adopt reasonable measures to boost the environmental awareness of consumers in order to realize the sustainable development of our society.

TI A Coherent Data Envelopment Analysis to Evaluate the Efficiency of
   Sustainable Supply Chains
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Measuring and improving the efficiency of a sustainable supply chain in an effective way for strategic decision making is important in the business world. In this article, an alternative coherent data envelopment analysis (CoDEA) with a representation of the intramural structure is established for evaluating the efficiency of a sustainable supply chain. The proposed CoDEA model not only maintains the traditional value of data envelopment analysis (DEA) in its "black box" approach, which avoids the intermediate measures among different nodes in the supply chain, but also overcomes some main pitfalls in previously developed DEA models. The usefulness of the proposed model is illustrated in both simple and complex supply chain situations, yielding reasonable efficiency scores as compared with those from the existing methods. Moreover, the dummy decision-making unit (DMU) introduced in CoDEA offers additional benefits in the scenario of a small supply chain. The approach allows the implicit rule that requires three times the ratio between the total measurement factors and total DMUs to be always satisfied, providing a higher discriminatory power of CoDEA. Based on the case studies covering both simple and complex supply chains, the results and sensitivity analysis ascertain that the proposed CoDEA model is a flexible and reasonable alternative with a good efficiency evaluation, contributing toward an efficient and sustainable supply chain management process pertaining to sustainable strategy or policy recommendations.

TI A macro-institutional perspective on supply chain environmental
   complexity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Supply chain management is a practitioner-generated discipline, which has gained much popularity in the last two decades. Adopting a supply chain perspective also involves the address of structural decision criteria relating to capacity, size and location of supply chain activity, the "supply chain" typified by a network of independent firms. As a result, it becomes important to address macro-institutional constraints, especially in any supply chain perspective because of the inherent global scope of supply chain operations. This paper uses the environment-strategy-performance (E-S-P) paradigm as a means to understand the relevance of environment (complexity) facing supply chain operations, while proposing that an environmental analysis best represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Environmental complexity is translated using Guisinger's [2001. From OLI to OLIVIA: incorporating higher levels of environmental and structural complexity into the eclectic paradigm. International journal of The Economics of Business 8(2), 257-272] proposed taxonomy of macro-institutions that are relevant and pose constraints to extended operations viz. with international or global outlook. Finally, this decision-making problem is illustrated by applying the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach to an illustrative site-location problem with generic constraints.

TI Adherence to responsibility in organic dry food supply chains
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the sharing of sustainability and social responsibility-centric values along the export-oriented organic dry food supply chain (ODFSC) using an institutional lens.
   Design/methodology/approach - To understand the perceptions of the shared ethos of the organic food industry along the entire supply chain, the research employed a multi-tier qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews and observations. The study focussed on supply chain actors including farmers and traders from the Indian sub-continent, and traders and retailers based in Europe and North America.
   Findings - Isomorphism, brought about by the vertical channelling of consumer preferences and values resulted in a higher degree of responsibility within the industry. The responsibility-centric ethos of the supply chain affected the responsibility-orientation of the supply chain actors and their operations.
   Research limitations/implications - The research focused mainly on the ODFSC actors in Kerala, a state in India, and this focus of the research could be a significant limitation in generalizing the findings to the rest of the emerging economy context because of cultural and educational differences.
   Originality/value - Literature lacks in the studies of sharing of responsibility-centric values in supply chains through an institutional lens and this investigation contributes to the scant literature on isomorphism, shared values and responsible supply chain management.

TI Integrating sustainability and resilience in the supply chain: A
   systematic literature review and a research agenda
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Sustainability has emerged as an important industrial strategic outlook expanding beyond organizational boundaries to include the supply chain. Simultaneously, the industry has also been faced with supply chain resilience concerns. Research on the intersection of supply chain sustainability and resilience is nascent and is a consequence of their observed mutual influences. However, confusion about concepts, implementation methods, and measurements of sustainable and resilient supply chains remains. This study completes a systematic literature review that critically examines several major observations and directions. We find the concept of sustainable supply chains is more established, and general agreement on its theoretical foundations exists. Supply chain resilience is relatively less mature. The nexus and relationships between the two topics are often incoherent: there is confusion on sustainable and resilient supply chains establishment; there is no clarity on what practices could jointly advance both areas. A major conflict exists since sustainability generally focuses on efficiency, while resilience seeks effectiveness. We recommend studies to analyze implementation relationships and impact. We also observe that performance measurement systems should be developed to assess supply chain sustainability and resilience performance taking with explicit consideration time horizons considered in these measures.

AB The seasonal thermal energy storage technology for domestic heating applications is not enjoying the same increasing market penetration as the smaller diurnal thermal energy storage technology. Although high efficiencies are to expect with seasonal thermal energy storages, high up-front costs are likely to constitute an efficient market barrier, impeding the growth of this technology. This paper analyses the application of seasonal thermal energy storages and other, more conventional heating alternatives on passive houses and standard houses from a behavioral economics perspective. The results show that when the seasonal thermal energy storage technology is applied to passive houses, more competitive investment and annual costs can be offered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Supply chains in circular business models: processes and performance
   objectives
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Circular business models formulate sustainable business strategies. To evaluate sustainable business strategies, it is necessary to be able to measure the actual performance of all processes of a supply chain in a circular business model. To measure the actual performance it is required to define what performance objectives are being pursued for all processes of a supply chain in a circular business model. There is a common understanding in literature that a supply chain in a circular business model differs from a supply chain in a linear business model. However, studies on what processes and what performance objectives conceptualize a supply chain in a circular business model are currently not available. A systematic literature review is conducted to conceptualize the processes and performance objectives of a supply chain in a circular business model. The study indicates that a supply chain in a circular business model consists of eight processes: (1) Plan (2) Source (3) Make (4) Deliver (5) Use (6) Return (7) Recover (8) Enable. Several processes need to be supplemented with subprocesses to enable planning of use and recovery, delivery of maintenance products and the return of end-of-use products. Furthermore, several processes need to shift their focus towards matching availability of resources (materials, water, energy) with the requirements of the supply chain, sourcing materials that minimize waste and enable returns and recovery after end-of-use, resource efficient production, sustainable packaging, waste disposal, buyback and take back programs. The performance objectives can be classified into performance objectives for the circular economy, performance objectives that focus on the Triple Bottom Line and performance objectives that characterize a supply chain in a circular business model.

TI Behind the runway: Extending sustainability in luxury fashion supply
   chains
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB From a resource-based view, this paper investigates sustainability integration across multiple tiers in two Italian luxury supply chains producing fashion and leather footwear, a complex and fragmented industry sector that is highly dependent upon raw materials and a human skills base. Qualitative in-depth interview data were collected from senior industry informants within 10 businesses, spanning multiple supply chain tiers. Industry practices are systematically decomposed into product, process and supply chain levels to analyse supply chain sustainability. Findings reveal that product-level practices focused on raw materials more than design initiatives, with operational benefits of cost reduction and market benefits of consumer value-add. Process-level practices in water and energy reduction were motivated by cost reduction benefits more than environmental concerns. At supply chain level, traceability projects and supplier audits were limited by a lack of end-to-end supply chain visibility, despite the criticality of raw materials and evidence of close and long-term trading relationships. Supply chain transparency and supplier engagement are critical areas for development. Both technical and relational resources must be developed across supply networks. Current practices are geared towards reducing negative impacts associated with current operations, falling short of the radical strategies needed to address root causes and embrace sustainability at large.

AB In the competitive globalized market, risk management is an important aspect of the supply chain, but it becomes crucial to the management of a faith-based supply chain. The halal supply chain is an emerging research era at an early stage. To retain the halalness from procurement to end customer, this research was aimed to identify and prioritize the important risk elements for managing the HSC. For this purpose, a literature review was studied, 42 risk factors, classified into seven dimensions, were categorized with the expert's opinion. A fuzzy best-worst method was proposed to analyze and prioritize the risk elements. The results indicated production-related risks are highly significant and sustainability-related risks are the least important among risk elements in the Halal supply chain. This research makes a major contribution by compiling a detailed list of risks associated with Halal supply chain management. It may also assist the manager in mitigations of risks for the Halal supply chain on a priority basis.

SO JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for green assessment across a hotel supply chain. The proposed framework was derived from the theory of "value creation" with a focus on green awareness, green know-how, and green implementation. These aspects are further explored using a structured research method and specific research questions. The study was conducted in selected hotels in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study has identified the currently used green practices across the supply chains of the surveyed hotels. Study results have confirmed the familiarity of UAE hotels with green practices and the awareness of green value. However, there was a gap in the green know-how in terms of the effective implementation of green techniques across the supply chain and the impacts of the adopted green practices. The study has also identified the obstacles of adopting green practices across the hotel supply chain. Literature indicates a growing awareness of adopting green practices in the service sector in general and in the hospitality industry in particular. However, despite the viability of the topic, it appears that comprehensive theoretical and analytical frameworks for assessing green practices in hotel supply chains are still underdeveloped. Thus, the proposed framework can be subsequently used by practitioners and researchers in conceptualization and assessment of green practices across hotel supply chains in the UAE and the region. Results also provide insight and guidance for adopting green practices across the supply chains of hotels globally. (C) 2017 The Authors.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The present study describes technological integration as source of the sustainable supply chain resilience. The implementation of sustainable supply chain resilience has recently played a vital role, owing to its substantial factors which influence the business continuity. The influence of sustainable supply chain resilience is greatly varying, to embrace companies' efficiency during a crisis such as COVID-19. In the present study, systematic model-based integration of sustainable supply chain resilience is developed, which can benefit the companies' profile of work normalcy during the pandemic situation by managing the associated risks. Different variable factors are considered, to assess their impact on the sustainable supply chain. These factors are environmental regulatory system, customer response monitoring system, environmental uncertainty, interoperability and operational integration. Data were collected by questionnaire and analyzed with statistical tools of interpretation. This research is concluded with the assessment that there is a significant correlation between technological integration and the resilient supply chain's sustainability. The business organizations need to understand the current COVID-19 situation, the supply chain issues, and their impact on the other factors. Business organizations need to implement international quality standards through the use of technology. This study highlights the critical components of technological advancement, which can uplift the existing standards. Overall, the study portrays the recent sustainable supply chain resilience-based orientation to cope with the current pandemic situation.

TI The hiearchical resource nature of green logistics competency
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine the common roots of both logistics and sustainability phenomena in supply chains to derive a new potential construct, green logistics competency.
   Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical synthesis and conceptualization of new construct.
   Findings - Based on Madhavaram and Hunt's (2008) resource hierarchy concept, the key to successfully competing with a sustainable supply chain may lie in whether the resources enabling both sustainability and effective supply chains are interdependent, as opposed to merely co-existent.
   Research limitations/implications - Most current theory regarding sustainable supply chains regards environmentally-friendly factors as resources that are additively bundled with supply chain resources. To determine if competitive performance differentials exist between truly green supply chains, and supply chains that merely adopt green practices, measurement must account for both the interdependence of green and supply chain resources, and their common cultural antecedents.
   Practical implications - The study indicates that it is not sufficient for firms to have expertise in both sustainability and in supply chain practices; managers in each of those areas must develop the cultural antecedents of both supply chain and sustainability excellence if firms are to achieve meaningful competitive capabilities through sustainable supply chains.
   Originality/value - This conceptual study addresses a paucity of theory describing how and why organizations build a genuinely green supply chain, as opposed to simply adapting supply chains to green practices.

TI Complex supply chain structures and multi-scope GHG emissions: the
   moderation effect of reducing equivocality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeClimate change requires the reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a task that seems to clash with increasing supply chain complexity. This study aims to analyse the upstream supply chain complexity dimensions suggesting the importance of understanding the information processing that these may entail. Reducing equivocality can be an issue in some dimensions, requiring the introduction of written guidelines to moderate the effects of supply chain complexity dimensions on GHG emissions at the firm and supply chain level.Design/methodology/approachA three-year panel data was built with information obtained from Bloomberg, Trucost and Compustat. Hypotheses were tested using random effect regressions with robust standard errors on a sample of 394 SP500 companies, addressing endogeneity through the control function approach.FindingsHorizontal complexity reduces GHG emissions at the firm level, whereas vertical and spatial complexity dimensions increase GHG emissions at the firm and supply chain level. Although the introduction of written guidelines neutralises the negative effects of vertical complexity on firm and supply chain GHG emissions, it is not sufficient in the presence of spatial complexity.Originality/valueThis paper offers novel insights by suggesting that managers need to reconcile the potential trade-off effects on GHG emissions that horizontally complex supply chain structures can present. Their priority in vertically and spatially complex supply chain structures should be to reduce equivocality.

TI Circular supply chain management: A definition and structured literature
   review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Circular economy is increasingly recognized as a better alternative to the dominant linear (take, make, and dispose) economic model. Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), which integrates the philosophy of the circular economy into supply chain management, offers a new and compelling perspective to the supply chain sustainability domain. Consequently, there is increasing research interest. However, a review of the extant literature shows that a comprehensive integrated view of CSCM is still absent in the extant literature. This prohibits a clear distinction compared to other supply chain sustainability concepts and hinders further progress of the field. In response, this research first classifies various terminologies related to supply chain sustainability and conceptualizes a unifying definition of CSCM. Using this definition as a base, it then conducts a structured literature review of 261 research articles on the current state of CSCM research. Based on the review results, the researchers call for further studies in the following directions that are important but received little or no attention: design for circularity, procurement and CSCM, biodegradable packaging, circular supply chain collaboration and coordination, drivers and barriers of CSCM, circular consumption, product liabilities and producer's responsibility, and technologies and CSCM.

TI Green Supply Chain Management: Implications for SMEs
SO ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT IN SMES AND ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS: DYNAMIC
   PROCESSES
AB The strategic importance of supply chain management has been increasing during the past two decades. Companies utilise the supply chain in order to become more competitive as a whole. Recently, it has been observed that environmental and social pressures and standards have a direct and indirect impact on supply chain management and the competitiveness of corporations. Integrating environmental criteria into supply chain management has become an important strategic issue for many companies. This study explores the subject area of the greening of supply chain management. In particular, the supply chain environmental management (SCEM) programme is explored in the Korean context. The SCEM programme is based upon the relationship between buyers and suppliers. By utilising this relationship, general improvement in the environmental performance of suppliers can be achieved. A case study of Hyundai Motors Co. (HMC) empirically supports this. Green supply chain management led to new ways of collaboration with suppliers, in terms of developing environmental solutions and capacity buildings with key suppliers. The key implication for suppliers, in particular SMEs, is to develop suppliers' capabilities and increasing supplier criticality in order to achieve win-win outcomes in environmental and financial performance.

TI Fuzzy cognitive maps approach for analysing the domino effect of factors
   affecting supply chain resilience: a fashion industry case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The domino effect that occurs among the concepts that affect Supply Chain Resilience has only been marginally analysed, and no conceptual models have been proposed in the literature. In this work, a conceptual model for analysing this domino effect is developed. The method aims to identify which supply chain concepts can support the containment of disruptions and how these concepts affect one another. The proposed methodology is based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The Cognitive Maps tool enables us to connect multidimensional and multidisciplinary concepts (e.g. sources of risk, disruption factors, supply chain management practices and other aspects). Moreover, this tool allows company managers to develop a detailed understanding of a system's behaviour and to explicitly consider the mind models of different players in the supply chain. A case study of the fashion industry supply chain is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method in an operating context. The proposed method enables a company to evaluate the hidden chain reaction of causes behind the most important factors that, from a single trigger event, are able to harm the entire Supply Chain. Through analysis of the causal relationships that this methodology highlights, decision makers can examine the domino effect among the concepts that influence Supply Chain Resilience in a step-by-step manner.

TI Do the roles of green supply chain learning, green employee creativity,
   and green organizational citizenship behavior really matter in circular
   supply chain performance?
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB To date, scholars have given less attention to how inter-firm learning and human factors promote a circular supply chain for SMEs in emerging markets. Drawing upon the socio-technical system theory, this study explores how green supply chain learning, green organizational citizenship behavior, and green employee creativity contribute to circular supply chain performance. Findings from a survey of 153 firms in Ghana suggest that green supply chain learning does not have a significant impact on circular supply chain performance and green employee creativity, but it significantly relates to green organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, green organizational citizenship behavior and green employees' creativity have a significant effect on circular supply chain performance. Finally, green organizational citizenship behavior and green employee creativity jointly mediate the relationship between green supply chain learning and circular supply chain performance. The study offers insight into the factors that drive circular supply chain performance of small and medium enterprises in an emerging economy.

TI Optimal configuration of a green product supply chain with guaranteed
   service time and emission constraints
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB This paper studies a supply chain configuration (SCC) problem for a green product family in consideration of guaranteed service time and emission constraints. Several alternative options can be employed to implement the functions of each stage and safety inventory is adopted to satisfy stochastic demands. An SCC model is formulated to optimize the service time and option selection decisions to minimize the overall cost of the supply chain. The structural properties of the model are addressed and the problem is decomposed into two subproblems, namely, the service time decision problem and option selection problem. For the service time decision problem, the structural properties of the supply chain network is carefully studied, based on which a spanning tree-based algorithm (STA) is presented to solve the problem optimally. For the option selection problem that is proven to be NP-hard, a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted to efficiently solve the problem. Consequently, a hybrid algorithm (STA+PSO) is developed to solve the SCC model. The numerical results show that the hybrid algorithm can efficiently and effectively solve the SCC model. The emission constraints on green products have significant effects on the supply chain cost and the emissions of the products; while the guaranteed service time also remarkably influences the supply chain configuration.

TI Effect of supply chain resilience on firm's sustainable competitive
   advantage: a dynamic capability perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Supply chain disruption caused by environmental uncertainty makes it more difficult for firms to obtain sustainable competitive advantages (SCA). Based on the perspective of dynamic capability, this study explored the effect of three dimensions of supply chain resilience (SCR) (proactive capabilities, reactive capabilities and supply chain design quality) on SCA. In addition, we further adopted operational vulnerability (OV) as a mediated variable to construct a conceptual framework and propose research hypotheses. The theoretical hypotheses were empirically developed based on a survey of 305 firms in China's manufacturing industry and subsequently tested. Our findings indicate that taking proactive action, properly configuring supply chain systems, and developing rapid reaction capabilities to recover from disruptions provide companies an opportunity to improve and to obtain SCA. Finally, the paper offers managers a management framework and dynamic strategy with which to develop SCR and alleviate the negative impact of OV, thus contributing to a firm's SCA.

TI Supply Chain Responsibility and Sustainability: The Role of The
   Individual in Building a Business Case for Ethical Decisions
SO BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL
AB Decisions made by supply chain managers have a far-reaching impact on the economic, environmental, and social performance of entire supply chains, even though many activities in the supply chain occur beyond the direct control of those managers. Some firms establish a line of moral disengagement, beyond which they distance themselves from the impact of the activities of the supply chain. This research addresses the question of why some managers choose to take responsibility for the sustainability of their supply chain, while others do not. We argue that the ethical predisposition and moral complexity of the individual employee moderates the interpretation of the drivers of sustainability, increasing or decreasing their ability to build a business case for supply chain responsibility. We also argue that ethical predisposition moderates the likelihood of a business case being enacted. We then discuss theoretical and managerial implications resulting from this finding.

AB The study of the interactions among the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability in supply chain management research has received increased attention in recent years. However, for the specific case of the biodiesel supply chain, little attention has been given to the inclusion of social aspects in an integrated analysis of sustainability performance. This paper in turn proposes and develops a deterministic multi objective linear programming model to analyze the relationship among the economic, environmental, and food security dimensions of the biodiesel supply chain (BSC) in Colombia. Considering four echelons from the supply chain (palm cultivation, oil extraction, biorefineries, and mixers), the model seeks to minimize total cost, impact on food security, and emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions from direct and indirect land use change. The Epsilon-constraint method is used to solve the multi-objective model for the BSC. A Pareto set of optimal solutions helped to assess the trade-offs involving the three objectives. The relationship between costs and emissions is contingent upon impact on food security; this is, the design of the supply chain network involving substitution of palm for agricultural crops exhibits lower total cost and lower CO2 emissions. The proposed generic mathematical model is applicable to any supply chain of agro-fuels and allows the calculation of production, inventory and distribution plans to better satisfy sustainability criteria.

TI Improving corporate social responsibility in a supply chain through a
   new revenue sharing contract
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Due to the social and environmental impacts of industrial activities in supply chains, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become critical for many international companies. This paper aims to integrate CSR into supply chain coordination. A new revenue sharing contract embedding corporate social responsibility (RS-CSR) is proposed for coordinating a two-tier supply chain. The RS-CSR contract requires that the manufacturer invest in CSR and charge the retailer a wholesale price. After the retailer sells products, it will return a ratio of its revenue to the manufacturer. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the optimal CSR investment, the wholesale price, and the revenue sharing ratio such that channel coordination is achieved. Two different objectives of the supply chain are discussed: profit maximizing and CSR performance maximizing. Numerical examples show that the RS-CSR contract can simultaneously achieve the following objectives under proper parameter settings: (1) improve CSR performance; (2) improve total supply chain profits; (3) ensure that each partner in the supply chain can benefit from the contract. The RS-CSR contract can be designed to achieve different level of CSR performance, subject to corporate culture of the SC and how the SC expects its profits and CSR performance. This study also provides theoretical support and operational procedures for SC managers to integrate CSR into business routines. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing customer demand for green products and the extended producer responsibility in combination with other regulation and opportunities for profit have introduced the environmental parameter in supply chain design. Environmental requirements may considerably affect the operation of supply chains. The logistical, economic and social dimensions of the recovery and re-use of used products, components and materials, in particular, may have prime importance for the company and society as well. Until lately the main environmental concerns were related with the manufacturing and the disposal phase. Although this approach has helped companies and communities in their efforts against environmental degradation, it has not affected the number of products per household, energy consumption and waste, which have increased significantly and have led to larger environmental impacts. As a consequence, environmental analysts and companies have shifted the environmental focus from the manufacturing processes and the disposal phase to the design of the total supply chain of products so as to minimize the environmental impacts in their whole life cycle.
   This paper investigates the environmental factors that contribute to the design and operation of closed-loop supply chains and the scientific approaches available for their analysis. The fundamental differences between the traditional (forward) supply and the reverse supply chains are analysed and discussed aiming at "closing the loop" in their ends and providing a framework for planning closed-loop supply chains. Indeed, the appropriate identification and planning of all life-cycle stages of a product, including its recovery and reuse, is necessary for the establishment and/or optimization of environmental policies. Any activity in the traditional supply chain may have an undesired impact on the reverse supply chain. And vice-versa, any disturbances in the ecological balance may affect production activities and social welfare in the long-term so that it is difficult to meet the strategic target of sustainable development. In this sense, the traditional supply chain is connected in both ends with the reverse supply chain to establish a perpetual cyclical operation. The analysis of the cost-effectiveness of schemes for the recovery of products is difficult; however, it is not sufficient to do so without looking at the whole process chain, combining the traditional supply chain aspects with the recovery ones.
   In this framework of analysis of environmental parameters in the design of closed-loop supply chains, the latter are viewed as an application field of Industrial Ecology and the analysis focuses on how they can benefit from each other.

SO JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the decision behaviors and channel coordination of a sustainable three-echelon supply chain with retailer-led game setting. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop game-theoretic models to examine the decision behaviors of channel members in a three-echelon supply chain consisting of one supplier, one distributor and one dominated retailer. The authors first formulate two models for centralized decision and decentralized decision. And then this paper proposes sub-supply chain coordination and a two-tariff contract to coordinate the full supply chain. Finally, some management insights are obtained with a case study. Findings The authors find that when faced with environmentally conscious consumers, the channel members can benefit from higher greening level; however, higher cost of green technologies would have negative impacts on manufacturer's effort. The analysis also shows that cooperation among players can improve the supply chain performance and help with environmental improvement. Research limitations/implications The findings provide important managerial insights for the three-echelon supply chain to achieve sustainable goals where the retailer bears the environmental responsibility. However, this paper also has some limitations with assuming risk-neutral channel members and symmetric information. Originality/value The findings of the study contribute to coordination and collaboration in sustainability of supply chains. The results provide important managerial insights for the three-echelon supply chain to achieve sustainable goals.

TI A goal programming model for a sustainable biomass supply chain network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The design of a biomass supply chain is a problem where multiple stakeholders with often conflicting objectives are involved. To accommodate the aspects stakeholder, the supply chain design should incorporate multiple objectives. In addition to the supply chain design, the management of energy from biomass is a demanding task, as the operation of production of biomass products needs to be aligned with the rest of the operations of the biomass supply chain. The purpose of the paper is to propose a mathematical framework for the optimal design of biomass supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach An integrated mathematical framework that models biomass production, transportation and warehousing throughout the nodes of a biomass supply chain is presented. Owing to conflicting objectives, weights are imposed on each aspect, and a 0-1 weighted goal programming mixed-integer linear programming (WGP MILP) programming model is formulated and used for all possible weight representations under environmental, economic and social criteria.
   Findings The results of the study show that emphasis on the environmental aspect, expressed with high values in the environmental criterion, significantly reduces the level of CO2 emissions derived from the transportation of biomass through the various nodes of the supply chain. Environmental and economic criteria seem to be moving in the same direction for high weight values in the corresponding aspect. From the results, social criterion seems to move to the opposite direction from environmental and economic criteria.
   Originality/value An integrated mathematical framework is presented modeling biomass production, transportation and warehousing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a model that integrates multiple objectives with supply chain design has not yet been published.

TI A Systematic Review on Technologies and Industry 4.0 in the Forest
   Supply Chain: A Framework Identifying Challenges and Opportunities
SO LOGISTICS-BASEL
AB Background: Forestry products and forestry organizations play an essential role in our lives and significantly contribute to the global economy. They are also being impacted by the rapid development of advanced technologies and Industry 4.0. More specifically, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been identified for their potential to optimize traditional forest supply chains. However, to date, there has been limited research that has systematically investigated these technologies and the scientific evidence on their impact on forest supply chains. This research systematically reviews the state-of-the-art technologies applied in the forest supply chain and reports on the current (and/or potential) impacts of technologies on the transformation of the forest supply chain towards 'Forest Industry 4.0 '. Methods: The systematic literature review methodology identified 45 peer-reviewed studies for inclusion that are analyzed, interpreted and discussed in this paper. Results: This study developed a framework on the forest supply chain in Industry 4.0. This framework has three components related to forest supply chains: current supportive technologies, improvements and characteristics of the forest supply chain in Industry 4.0, and the strategic outcomes in economic, environmental and social dimensions. The reported impacts of technologies in different phases of the forest supply chain are interpreted and discussed. Conclusion: The study results confirm that most technologies in Industry 4.0 have real or perceived positive impacts on the forest supply chain and reported obstacles and challenges are identified. The results of this study also contribute insights on the wide range of options in terms of technologies available to decision-makers to optimize the forest supply chain towards 'Forest Industry 4.0 '.

TI Green Supply Chain: a protagonist or a supporting role in Brazil?
SO RAE-REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO DE EMPRESAS
AB Environmental issues began to be introduced more frequently in corporate business. As for the supply chain, Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) emerges as a new approach to corporate responsibility towards the environment. This article aims to analyze the diffusion of the GSCM concept and practices in the Brazilian scenario. To do that, we conducted interviews with experts on the subject of the supply chain in the area of Management in Brazil. The results show that the reasons for the slow development of the concept may relate to characteristics of the domestic market, corporate focus on internal aspects, lack of strict legislation, and low consumer pressure. Experts notice, however, good prospects for the future of discussions on the subject in the Country, due to the National Solid Waste Policy, pressure from the international market, and the search for environmental certification. This study sought to foster further discussions on GSCM in Brazil.

TI A fuzzy approach to analyzing the level of resilience in manufacturing
   supply chains
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Achieving sustainability and resilience in supply chains is a topic of contemporary interest to supply chain practitioners of the decade. Resilience is a technological capability that enables the supply chain to manage and mitigate disruptions. A major challenge lies in the measurement of supply chain resilience. Resilient Fuzzy Index (RFI) is proposed in this research to measure the level of resilience of firms. Also, Performance Fuzzy Index (PFI) is developed in this study that aids in identifying critical attributes affecting resilience in supply chains. Calculation of RFI and PFI could assist top management in evaluating resilience capabilities of the supply chain for taking strategic level decisions. The proposed framework has also been evaluated in an actual electronics manufacturing company in India. Euclidian distances were calculated using the methodology and the status of the resilience of the supply chain of the case electronics manufacturing company is found to be matching with the Extremely Resilient' status. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted and the results of the same show that there is a full possible shift from Extremely Resilient' to Definitely Resilient' level, by improving the performance rating of the attributes to their maximum possible values. And from the results of the case study, managers can measure, compare, and improve the level of resilience of their supply chains. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The EU recently requested all products exporting to the region follow the Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directives. The objective of this study is, therefore, to understand what issues manufacturing firms, at different positions of a green supply chain, must address to comply with environmental regulations. Specifically, how firms deal with requests or requirements from their customers as well as the impositions they attempted to place on their vendors. Five manufacturing companies from the computer industry are included in the case study regarding their green supply chain and compliance practices. The preliminary results indicate that (1) EM strategy affects the regulation compliance practices and effort, (2) EU directives foster green partnership and in turn strengthen international supply chain management, and (3) supply chain position, size, and interdependence could moderate the effort and challenges of regulation compliance.

TI The significance for solar heat gain on the indoor thermal environment
   of passive houses in cold areas in China
SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB In the passive house system in cold regions today, the strategies focus on reducing energy loss by enhancing the thermal insulation performance of the building's envelope. Yet, under the specific background, the application of passive house evaluation system lacks emphasis on the significance of solar heat gain. In this paper, two independent passive houses in cold areas in China were selected as research objects, which had almost the same geographic locations, building shapes, and floor plans, through simulation and on-site measurement to discuss the influence of solar heat gain on non-heating sunny and overcast winter days on the indoor thermal environment. The result shows that the house which had a weaker envelope in thermal insulation performance but more solar heat gain performed better than the one which had a stronger envelope but less solar heat gain. It indicates that in the passive house system in cold areas in China, solar heat gain is of great significance and has equal status with the thermal insulation performance of envelopes, which has significant reference value for the early stages of passive house designing and the evaluation criteria.

TI Digital Technologies for Forest Supply Chain Optimization: Existing
   Solutions and Future Trends
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The role of digital technologies for fostering sustainability and efficiency in forest-based supply chains is well acknowledged and motivated several studies in the scope of precision forestry. Sensor technologies can collect relevant data in forest-based supply chains, comprising all activities from within forests and the production of the woody raw material to its transformation into marketable forest-based products. Advanced planning systems can help to support decisions of the various entities in the supply chain, e.g., forest owners, harvest companies, haulage companies, and forest product processing industry. Such tools can help to deal with the complex interdependencies between different entities, often with opposing objectives and actions-which may increase efficiency of forest-based supply chains. This paper analyzes contemporary literature dealing with digital technologies in forest-based supply chains and summarizes the state-of-the-art digital technologies for real-time data collection on forests, product flows, and forest operations, as well as planning systems and other decision support systems in use by supply chain actors. Higher sustainability and efficiency of forest-based supply chains require a seamless information flow to foster integrated planning of the activities over the supply chainthereby facilitating seamless data exchange between the supply chain entities and foster new forms of collaboration. Therefore, this paper deals with data exchange and multi-entity collaboration aspects in combination with interoperability challenges related with the integration among multiple process data collection tools and advanced planning systems. Finally, this interdisciplinary review leads to the discussion of relevant guidelines that can guide future research and integration projects in this domain.

AB In recent years, with the gradual attention to environmental pollution and the deep understanding of sustainability theory, the supply chain of the real estate industry has begun to change to a green and sustainable development approach. In 2016, Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology and other real estate industry alliance organizations, together with Vanke and other industry leaders, launched the "Green Supply Chain Action" to establish a green procurement whitelist by testing the environmental performance of building materials suppliers in various categories. This paper focuses on the impact of the number of suppliers regulated by the company on the financial performance of the company in the sustainable supply chain. The empirical results show that the number of suppliers under corporate supervision is negatively related to financial performance. In response to the findings, this paper puts forward development suggestions for real estate green supply chain management.

TI The impact of carbon pricing on a closed-loop supply chain: an
   Australian case study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Concerns about industrial and supply chain implications on our natural environment have existed for decades. Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have caused countries to implement various instruments ranging from taxes, permits and voluntary incentives to required regulatory policies. Given this environment, we develop a unified optimization model for a closed-loop supply chain in which the carbon emission is expressed in terms of dollar carbon cost. This study is one of the first to evaluate the forward and reverse supply chain influences on the carbon footprint. A comparative analysis is completed with a decomposition of cost and environmental influences across supply chain functions. We utilize data from a company located in Australia, where the government is currently introducing a carbon pricing scheme. We find that variations in cost and environmental impacts occur over ranges of carbon pricing. Characteristics and patterns of the numerical results over these ranges provide insights for corporate key strategies and potential additional government policies. These results and implications are analyzed along with limitations and directions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Developing a Mathematical Model for a Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain
   with a Multi-Objective Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm
SO FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING AND DECISION SCIENCES
AB Intense competition in today's market and quick change in customer preferences, along with the rapid development of technology and globalization, have forced companies to work as members of a supply chain instead of individual companies. The success of the supply chain depends on the integration and coordination of all its institutions to form an efficient network structure. An efficient network leads to cost savings throughout the supply chain and helps it respond to customer needs faster. Accordingly, and with respect to the importance of the supply chain, in this study a developed mathematical model for the design of a green closed-loop supply chain is presented. In this mathematical model, the economic and environmental objectives are simultaneously optimized. In order to tackle this mathematical model, two methods of epsilon constraint and multi-objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithm have been applied. The results of comparisons between the two mentioned methods show that MOGWO reduce the average solving time from about 1300 seconds to 88 seconds. In the last step of this research, in order to show the application of the proposed mathematical model and the method of solving the research problem, it was implemented in the supply chain of Dalan Kouh diary product and the Pareto optimal solutions were analyzed.

TI Climate adaptive thermal characteristics of envelope of residential
   passive house in China
SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
AB Passive house has been constructed in China on a large-scale over the past couple years for its great energy saving potential. However, research indicates that there is a significant discrepancy in energy performance for heating and cooling between passive houses in different climate zones. Therefore, this research develops a comparative analysis on the energy saving potential of passive houses with the conventional around China. A sensitivity analysis of thermal characteristics of building envelope (insulation of exterior walls and windows, and airtightness) on energy consumption is further carried out to improve the climate adaptability of passive house. Moreover, the variation of energy consumption under different heat gain intensity is also compared, to evaluate the effects of envelope thermal characteristics comprehensively. Results suggest that the decrease of exterior wall insulation leads to the greatest increase in energy consumption, especially in severe cold zone in China. However, the optimal insulation may change with the internal heat gain intensity, for instance, the decrease of insulation (from 0.4 to 1.0 W/(m(2)center dot K)) could reduce the energy consumption by 4.65 kW center dot h/(m(2)center dot a) when the heat gain increases to 20 W/m(2) for buildings in Hot Summer and Cold Winter zone in China.

TI Incentives and Emission Responsibility Allocation in Supply Chains
SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB Because greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the supply chains of just the 2,500 largest global corporations account for more than 20% of global emissions, rationalizing emissions in supply chains could make an important contribution toward meeting the global CO2 emission-reduction targets agreed upon in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider supply chains with joint production of GHG emissions, operating under either a carbon-tax regime, wherein a regulator levies a penalty on the emissions generated by the firms in the supply chain, or an internal carbon pricing scheme. Supply chain leaders, such as Walmart, are assumed to be environmentally motivated to induce their suppliers to abate their emissions. We adopt a cooperative game theory methodology to derive a footprint-balanced scheme for reapportioning the total carbon emissions amongst the firms in the supply chain. This emission responsibility allocation scheme, which is the Shapley value of an associated cooperative game, is shown to have several desirable characteristics. In particular, (i) it is transparent and easy to compute; (ii) when the abatement-cost functions of the firms are private information, it incentivizes suppliers to exert pollution-abatement efforts that, among all footprint balanced allocation schemes, minimize the maximum deviation from the socially optimal pollution level; and (iii) the Shapley value is the unique allocation mechanism satisfying certain contextually desirable properties.

TI Towards a theory of multi-tier sustainable supply chains: a systematic
   literature review
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework that synthesizes approaches and contingency variables to manage the sustainability of multi-tier supply chains and sub-suppliers.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a systematic literature review, the authors analyse 39 studies and relevant theories to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates research efforts so far.
   Findings - The authors build a conceptual framework that incorporates four approaches to manage the sustainability of multi-tier supply chains. They also identify several contingency variables (e. g. power, dependency, distance, industry, knowledge resources) and their effect on the proposed approaches.
   Research limitations/implications - Based on the framework, six research propositions that advance the theories on multi-tier supply chain management, allow lead firms to develop comprehensive sustainable supply chain strategies and set the ground for future research in the area were developed.
   Originality/value - This study provides a novel framework for studying sustainability in multi-tier supply chains that goes beyond the single-tier perspective and incorporates the extended supply chain.

TI International Scope of Operations and the Nature of Supply Chain
   Members' CSR Policy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB Dynamic relations among supply chain members have forced some changes in those members' business philosophy. One such change involves Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which posits an alternative attitude for companies towards business, the natural environment and society. The supply chain structure provides an excellent framework to disseminate the CSR idea among other members. That process is affected by different factors, including the level of internationalization of a given business. The purpose of this paper is to specify relations between the international nature of operations and CSR approach in 150 Polish companies. To better understand these relations a literature review and statistical analysis are conducted. Methods used in the quantitative analysis are a frequency analysis (with usage of One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov and One-Sample Chi-Square tests) and a correlation analysis (Spearman ratio). This research addresses a gap concerning international aspects of supply chain operations and its CSR sensitivity. The results can be used to support supply chain decision makers when applying CSR in their companies as well as can be an outgoing source of data for further, more detailed research.

TI A Soft System Dynamic Approach for Designing Palm Kernel Shell Supply
   Chain
SO OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Palm kernel shell (PKS) is a waste of palm oil processing, that has enormous potential to become a green energy resource for industries with thermal conversion. To realize PKS potential as biomass fuel, it is important to build an effective, efficient, and sustainable supply chain model. As with other biomass, PKS supply chain involves collection processes, storage facilities, and a transportation network, which is dynamic and optimizable. Soft systems dynamics methodology (SSDM) has been implemented in this study, by which its key feature of system dynamics is recognized as one of the most ideal modeling techniques for studying such complex and multivariate system. We demonstrate how to apply SSDM in analyzing and designing a sustainable supply system of PKS through mathematical modeling and simulations, which capture the long-term effect of and the interactions among supply chain design variables and parameters. The simulation results show that the proposed supply chain model would be able to deliver continuous availability of PKS at the end customer side by achieving the goal of minimum 95% customer production level despite decreasing PKS generation rate from the source and increasing other consumption rate. Furthermore, decision makers can identify and implement necessary changes and recommendations to improve the existing supply chain system. The application of soft systems dynamics approach in biomass supply chain will enable greater use of green energy for continuous industrial purposes.

TI Strategic supply chain development by integration of key global
   logistical process linkages
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB As manufacturing firms search relentlessly for sources of competitive advantage, a greater emphasis is developing on supply chain management as a means of achieving differentiation in a firm's strategic position. Currently, some researchers are focusing on effective 'end to end' management of key logistical process linkages within the supply chain, as a means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to emulate. The emphasis presented is on improved delivery performance and customer service. This involves defining optimized balances between supply chain parameters, the achievement of which should result in reduced cost, improved use of working capital, better asset utilization and optimized intra-supply-chain usage. This paper discusses the development of a model and illustrates an application in a major multinational steel producer. Progress has been made in understanding the logistical processes that are used to manage supply chain linkages and, importantly, in understanding the feed-forward and feedback linkages that are necessary to enable supply chain management to be more effective. A generic model for a tiered approach to the planning and scheduling of manufacturing supply chains is thus presented. Ideas for further work are described.

AB The sustainability reporting efforts of MNCs who are members of the Fortune Global 250 (FG250) was investigated. The focus was on sustainability reporting by MNCs of supply chain impacts. The reporting of FG250 MNCs was examined to determine if greenwashing was occurring or whether MNCs had committed to operating a green supply chain. A mixed methodology was used consisting of quantitative analysis of 25 MNC CSR/sustainability reports which were randomly selected from the FG250 listing. Qualitative analysis using content analysis was also conducted on the reports. Both methodologies concentrated on the sustainability reporting of the selected MNCs in regard to their supply chain. Findings were mixed as there were great variations among the MNCs in their level of sustainability reporting about their supply chains. Some MNCs did not report on the activities of their supply chain at all (20 %), the majority of the MNCs reported on their supply chain impacts at the value and goal level (48 %), while the rest reported at the management approach level (32 %). A majority of the sampled MNCs could be accused of greenwashing due to the lack of detailed quantitative information provided by the MNCs on the environmental impacts of their supply chain.

TI Improving Linkages Through a Service-oriented Local Farmers-Hotel Supply
   Chain-An Explanatory Case in Grenada
SO TOURISM PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT
AB Ensuring strong sectorial linkages exist with tourism and other sectors in the economy to retain and distribute tourism benefits to communities is often the goal of destination planners. While agriculture and tourism food linkage is considered, the literature suggests that farmer-hotel supply chain relationships are often weak, resulting in economic leakages due to high food importation to support the tourism sector, particularly in developing tourism destinations. The traditional transactional management of hotel supply chains fails to facilitate consistent and strong trade between the two sectors. Therefore, a service-oriented farmers-hotel supply chain is proposed, which places greater value on local food by making the local food part of the service experience. Research findings indicated that service-oriented approach through value co-creation, valued relationships and leveraging intangible resources embedded in local food although not fully exploited in this case study presents opportunities to improve and strengthen of local food supply chains.

TI Nested Partitions for Large-Scale Optimization in Supply Chain
   Management
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS: INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES AND
   PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS
SE Industrial and Systems Engineering Series
AB In today's global business environment, an effective and reliable supply chain substantially increases a company's competitive advantage. Supply chain management has played a crucial role in a business's success. Optimization has been sought to model and solve many of these supply chain problems. However, as the size of the optimization model grows, the difficulty of finding the optimal or near-optimal solution typically grows exponentially. Nested partitions is one of the algorithms developed to tackle these large-scale optimization problems. In this chapter, the nested partitions method, and its implementation in two critical supply chain problems, are reviewed. One problem is the intermodal hub location problem, a special case of facility location problems, and the other is the multilevel capacitated lot-sizing problem with backlogging, a complex problem in production planning. The computational results show that the hybrid nested partitions approaches are superior to standard mathematical programming and specialized heuristic approaches, and thus provide an effective alternative in enhancing supply chain performance.

TI Green supply chain practices and sustainable performance of mining
   firms: Evidence from a developing country
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB The negative impact of mining activities on mining communities has received increased calls for mining firms to engage in management practices that are deemed to be environmentally friendly. Using the ecological modernisation theory, the study sought to examine which of the environmentally accepted supply chain management practices should be encouraged to ensure that mining firms are able to sustain their performance economically, socially and environmentally. The current study, therefore, used the explanatory study design to gather primary data from 200 respondents. Data were analysed by means of PLS-SEM to model the relationship between green supply chain management practices and sustainable performance. The findings of the study indicated that all the four constructs of sustainable supply chain management practices predict the sustainable performance of mining firms. The study, therefore, recommends the adoption of green supply chain management practices by mining firms in order to sustain their performance. Details of the findings are discussed.

TI Under pressure: Finding organizational legitimacy through the supply
   chain
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT
AB This study analyzes whether firms face a tradeoff in responding to pressures of shareholders versus stakeholders in their quest for supply chain management excellence. Are firms that are recognized and rewarded for their supply chain management practices less likely than other firms to have a strong record in community relations, product qualities, employee relations, environmental sustainability and diversity measures? To answer this question, the study utilizes event study, OLS regression and panel data analyses of firms receiving a Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 ranking and a comparative sample of these same firms in non-ranked years. The findings indicate that shareholders react positively to a Gartner ranking, suggesting that ranked firms receive significant incentives to pursue recognition. Additionally, positive stakeholder practices are significantly stronger for firms ranked versus those not ranked. These findings suggest that firms can successfully navigate the pressures congruent with both shareholder and stakeholder priorities through supply chain excellence.

TI EMERGING DISCOURSE INCUBATOR: The Roles of Institutional Complexity and
   Hybridity in Social Impact Supply Chain Management
SO JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Supply chain research and practice has moved beyond green or environmental issues to include social issues. But much of the focus still remains on attempts of large companies to reduce social harm along their supply chains rather than creating social good. At the same time, research investigating the role of NGOs in supply chains or humanitarian logistics often emphasizes temporary initiatives and overlooks long-term viability. This conceptual paper seeks to expand the playing field by looking at how social enterprises manage their supply chains to generate social benefit while maintaining or improving their financial viability in the long term. Our contribution is to consider those socially motivated organizations that lie on the continuum between purely social and purely commercial enterprises. We consider how these organizations manage their supply chains for social impact and define this area as social impact supply chain management (SISCM). In this work, we view these organizations and managerial issues through the lens of institutional complexity, that is, the presence of multiple and possibly conflicting institutional logics in the focal organization. We propose that, for these organizations, supply chain strategy, stakeholder identification and engagement, and relationship management might differentiate SISCM from traditional supply chain management. And as a result, we offer future research directions that might add clarity to effective SISCM.

TI Analysis of Product Complexity considering Disruption Cost in Fast
   Fashion Supply Chain
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Outsourcing in the textile industry has been playing an important role in the global economy for six decades. Recently, reshoring is an emerging trend due to various complexities involved in supply chain management. As compared with basic textile and apparel products, fast fashion products are complex in their own way. A single assortment contains several new styles, colors, and sizes with unpredictable demand and urgent deadlines. Numerous assortments run simultaneously in the supply chain. For each assortment, the garment manufacturer has to source various types of fabrics and materials from different suppliers and then manufacture the garments to ship within the deadlines. This complexity contributes to supply chain disruption. This paper develops a model to estimate supply chain disruption cost as a function of fast fashion product complexity in the global outsourcing environment. Estimation of disruption cost will help us to increase visibility and eliminate the bottlenecks in supply chain. Model conclusions are used to develop a method to manage the level of product complexity from the global supply chain perspective. Several strategies are proposed to manage the impact of product complexity on supply chain design.

TI Multilayered Distribution System in India: Practice and Issues
SO CASES ON PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT:
   TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION AND MATURITY
AB With the invention of Internet, supply chains have become more comprehensive, global, and faster than ever before. Traditionally, companies used to cut costs through manpower reduction, waste reduction, process automation, and inventory control. However, today those companies that reduce costs in their supply chain are the ones who can remain competitive in the market and provide their customers with a superior quality product. Cost reduction in supply chain is not a new concept. Dell worked with just-in-time systems to make its supply chain both time and cost efficient. Companies have sought to make their supply chains both lean and agile and thus become cost efficient as well as responsive to customer demands. Although there are so many examples of modern global supply chains, most of the supply chains in Indian sub-continent still suffer from a number of inefficiencies.
   The multi-layered market structure, as well as the lack of resilience among supply chain partners, aggravates the issue. Lack of experience and confidence in modern supply chains precludes the supply chain partners to introduce any innovation in the supply chains.
   This chapter presents several case studies of the multilayered system in India and shows how the prevalent distribution system preclude any means of cost reduction and making these supply chains efficient. Supply chains of perishable goods, electronic products, FMCG products and Pharmaceutical products are discussed in this chapter. Each of these supply chains present unique challenges and issues that need attention. The three main objectives in these studies are to understand the distribution systems as well as cost economics of the supply chains, identify potential conflicts and issues in their distribution system, and to study the effect of macro-environment on the distribution system. Apart from these objectives, these cases are also meant to prepare those venturing into such supply chains to come up with efficient solutions for improving these supply chains.

TI ANALYSIS OF SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES ADOPTED WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN UNDER
   THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE
SO RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The understanding that natural resources are finite is leading organizations to redefine their supply chain toward sustainability. In this way, the purpose of this article is to investigate if the sustainable practices applied within the supply chain are following all the dimensions proposed by the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was carried out within the CAPES journal base from 2004 to 2017. From this sample, sustainable practices were segmented into economic, social and environmental, orientated by the sustainability tripod. The result shows that the economic and environmental dimensions have significant relevance regarding the adoption of sustainable practices in the supply chain whereas no significant evidence was found within the social context. New studies will be needed to understand why companies are not including the social issue in their sustainable practices within the supply chain and what can be done to reverse this situation.

TI Effects of Carbon Policy on Carbon Emission Reduction in Supply Chain
   under Uncertain Demand
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Although there are many articles on carbon emission reduction of sustainable supply chain, most of them study the carbon emission reduction efficiency of supply chain in the case of single carbon policy or demand determination. Based on previous studies, this paper considered a supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer in an uncertain demand market. The effects of demand randomness and different carbon policies on carbon emission reduction level and optimal decision in supply chain were studied by constructing mean-variance utility function and Stackelberg game. Due to the difficulty of data acquisition, this paper verified the equalization results by numerical simulation. The results show that: (1) cap-and-trade policy, government subsidy policy and carbon tax policy can promote the carbon emission reduction investment of supply chain, while carbon tax policy will lead to the decline of the overall profit of supply chain; (2) For the manufacturer and the retailer, adopting a strategy with a low degree of risk avoidance will increase its own profits; (3) For the supply chain as a whole, it is more advantageous for manufacturers to adopt higher risk avoidance strategies, while retailers to adopt lower risk avoidance strategies. In addition, in the conclusion, this paper puts forward management implications related to stakeholders, thus providing help for the development of sustainable supply chain.

TI Modeling defaults of companies in multi-stage supply chain networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The interest in supply chain networks and their analysis as complex systems is rapidly growing. The physical approach to the topic draws on the concept of heterogenous interacting agents. The interaction among agents is considered as a repeated process of orders and production. The dynamics of production in the supply chain network which we observe is nonlinear due to the random failures in processes of orders and production. We introduce an agent-based model of a supply chain network which represents in more detail the real economic environment in which firms operate. We focus on the influence of local processes on the global economic behavior of the system and study how the proposed modifications change the general properties of the model. We observe collective bankruptcies of firms, which lead to self-emerging network structures. Our results give insight into the dynamics of default processes in supply chain networks, which have important implications both for risk managers and policy makers. Based on the simulations we show that agent-based modeling is a powerful tool for optimization of supply chain networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Process of innovation knowledge increase in supply chain network from
   the perspective of sustainable development
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend prior supply chain research by describing the process of innovation knowledge increase in supply chain network. More specifically, this study investigates the role of network density, and views the knowledge increase as the process of knowledge diffusion and knowledge innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multi-agent model, which demonstrates the process of knowledge increase in supply chain network, was established, and simulated by using NetLogo simulation platform.
   Findings - The results indicate that the network density will promote the knowledge increase of the supply chain when it is high or low. In the meantime, these results show that the inhibition of knowledge diffusion and knowledge innovation will appear when network density is moderate.
   Originality/value - Although previous research has identified the importance of knowledge increase in promoting sustainable development of supply chain, far less attention was given to the study of the effect of network structure on the knowledge increase in supply chain. This study thus fulfills the research gap by providing a description of the process of knowledge increase with the consideration of network density. The conclusion is of great significance for the choice of network density for sustainable development of supply chain.

TI The effect of supply chain disruptions on shareholder wealth in small
   and mid-cap companies
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose
   Supply chain disruptions can have severe negative consequences on companies. However, studies measuring the financial impacts of supply chain disruptions are largely confined to developed nations and large companies. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the impact of supply chain disruption on small companies in the context of an emerging nation. Further, an attempt has been made to classify supply chain disruptions and measure its impact by its type.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this research, the event study on 335 supply chain disruption events for a 10 year period starting from 2009 to 2019 has been used.
   Findings
   The results state that the Indian small and medium companies lost -4.49% of shareholder wealth in disruption. The findings also indicate that the financial and environmental disruptions can have severe effect on shareholder wealth as compared to other category.
   Research limitations/implications
   The study is confined to a developing country. Considering multiple countries can provide comparative results and therefore a global consensus could be achieved.
   Practical implications
   The outcomes of the results help managers to plan and prioritize supply chain disruptions, regulatory authorities can plug any possible insider trading practices for small companies in the event of supply chain disruptions. Investors can plan and take prudent investing decisions based on the nature of the disruptions.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study measuring the supply chain disruption effects on smaller companies in an emerging nation. The study is also novel in incorporating financial disruptions and measuring source wise impact on shareholder wealth.

TI Virtualization of food supply chains with the internet of things
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB Internet technologies allow supply chains to use virtualizations dynamically in operational management processes. This will improve support for food companies in dealing with perishable products, unpredictable supply variations and stringent food safety and sustainability requirements. Virtualization enables supply chain actors to monitor, control, plan and optimize business processes remotely and in real-time through the Internet, based on virtual objects instead of observation on-site. This paper analyses the concept of virtual food supply chains from an Internet of Things perspective and proposes an architecture to implement enabling information systems. As a proof of concept, the architecture is applied to a case study of a fish supply chain. These developments are expected to establish a basis for virtual supply chain optimization, simulation and decision support based on on-line operational data. In the Internet of Things food supply chains can become self-adaptive systems in which smart objects operate, decide and learn autonomously. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Ergonomics and sustainability - challenges from global supply chains
SO WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
AB The development of globalised supply chains is a major challenge for sustainability. For several years, there has been discussion within the profession whether and how ergonomics and human factors can play a role. Based on our research, we have identified five major challenges from global supply chains especially related to the social aspects of sustainability: (1) criteria for social sustainability, (2) the role of key performance indicators in the management of supply chains, (3) the constant changes in supply chains, (4) the challenge in establishing participation, and (5) the development of agency and regulatory mechanisms. There are obviously no clear and simple solutions to these challenges. One possible avenue for progress might lie in acquiring a greater understanding of the challenges from global supply chains and developing a strategy which combines social and long-term business sustainability. Starting from such a basis, the next step would be to find ways for the ergonomics and human factors community to create international collaboration which can impact specific global supply chains.

TI The relatedness of open- and closed-loop supply chains in the context of
   the circular economy; Framing a continuum
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB The configuration of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to recover and remarket products has been discussed as a crucial pathway in the transition towards the circular economy (CE). However, in the context of the CE, circular supply chains (CSCs) have an extended role to recover materials and minimize waste that goes beyond the particular firm's product recovery and remarketing. Thus, the open-loop supply chains (OLSCs) have an equally important role to play as supply chain configurations where actors other than the OEM engage in product and material recovery. While the literature on CLSC is a mature field, studies that analyze the complementary nature of CLSC and OLSC in addressing the transition to the CE are scant. Based on a systematic literature review (2007-2021), this paper contributes to literature by identifying some of the characteristics of OLSC, providing empirical illustrations, and developing a conceptual framework of the open- and closed-loop supply chain continuum.

AB As environmental protection becomes increasingly important, so does the significance of incorporating the recycling manufacturing model into the supply chain. Meanwhile, addressing supply chain disruption is imperative in the supply chain. To understand the relationship between remanufacturing and supply chain disruption, we studied the effect of supply chain disruption, remanufacturing, blockchain technology, and government subsidies on preventing supply chain disruption in the second period. There have two models in the following discussion. In the local market, a manufacturer M manufactures and recycles products for remanufacture in the second stage. At the same time, retailer R is responsible for the sales of products. We also add government subsidies and blockchain technology, discussing those roles in preventing supply chain disruptions in the second period. Blockchain technology and government subsidies are equally crucial in averting disruptions during the second period, although they may only provide partial protection against supply chain disruption.

AB The uncertain environment because of the COVID-19 pandemic has immensely impacted the global supply chain, as several countries-imposed travel restrictions. In such a situation, the present study aims at investigating impacts of customer relationship management (CRM) competency, information technology (IT) competency, and contingency management on supply chain management (SCM). The present work examines how leadership support affects supply chain sustainability. From theories as well as from literature inputs, we have developed a conceptual model. Validation of the conceptual model was done using the PLS-SEM technique to analyse 311 responses from the different organisations in India. The study found that CRM competency, IT competency, and appropriate contingency management have significant impacts on supply chain sustainability during uncertain environments. The role of the moderator 'leadership support' also impacts sustainability in supply chain during such crisis.

TI Supplier selection using fuzzy AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear
   programming for developing low carbon supply chain
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Environmental sustainability of a supply chain depends on the purchasing strategy of the supply chain members. Most of the earlier models have focused on cost, quality, lead time, etc. issues but not given enough importance to carbon emission for supplier evaluation. Recently, there is a growing pressure on supply chain members for reducing the carbon emission of their supply chain. This study presents an integrated approach for selecting the appropriate supplier in the supply chain, addressing the carbon emission issue, using fuzzy-AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming. Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) is applied first for analyzing the weights of the multiple factors. The considered factors are cost, quality rejection percentage, late delivery percentage, green house gas emission and demand. These weights of the multiple factors are used in fuzzy multi-objective linear programming for supplier selection and quota allocation. An illustration with a data set from a realistic situation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed approach can handle realistic situation when there is information vagueness related to inputs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lean enterprise, six sigma, and other productivity improvement techniques use continuous improvement; however, it appears continuous improvement is haphazardly applied or even lacking in companies, especially across the supply chain. This research identifies key continuous improvement characteristics in regard to leadership, learning, and collaborating that need to be executed more effectively.
   This research was conducted among a population of 174 different automotive companies in nine industries. Only 7.1% of companies with less than 100 to 249 employees used lean or six sigma. Participants using lean or six sigma struggled with extending initiatives to include suppliers (56%), as well as other areas that support building a competitive supply chain. While initial gains from these productivity improvement techniques are beneficial, the long-term impact of continuous improvement across the supply chain will offer these companies sustainable market power.

TI Supply chain network equilibrium considering coordination between
   after-sale service and product quality
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB In a highly integrated supply chain system, the trade-off between after-sale service and product quality becomes an important consideration in establishing and maintaining a sustainable supply chain partnership. To this end, we proposed an underlying decentralized supply chain network (DSCN) equilibrium model for service-quality coordination under capacity constraints and demand uncertainty. The proposed DSCN model is compared with centralized supply chain network (CSCN). Then, the buyback contract is introduced to coordinate the DSCN. After the implementation of supply chain network equilibrium (SCNE) in numerical examples, we obtain the equilibrium solution of the proposed model. The result shows that, compared with DSCN, CSCN does not always provide better service or product quality. Moreover, by introducing the buyback contract, the equilibrium profits of DSCN are improved, so that the Pareto improvement occurs. Our findings can provide useful analytical frameworks and implications for how to coordinate after-sale service, product quality, selling price, and product ordering decisions in the supply chain network simultaneously.

SO OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Courier is a booming industry in today's world. Courier company is one of the most significant 3PLs modules. With the development of globalisation, e-business, shorter product and technology life cycles and higher customer expectations, courier service providers face more supply chain uncertainty and risk than ever before. The supply chain uncertainty and risk has significant impacts on logistics performance in the courier service providers. Uncertainties and risks are interchangeable and inseparable. Moreover, in a real world environment, managers have to face and manage both supply chain uncertainty and risk simultaneously. The purpose of this paper is to present the results for development of an empirically validated measurement of supply chain uncertainty and risk in the Australian courier industry. The empirical data was collected in the Australian courier industry. A measurement model of structural equation modelling is used to identify the underlying factors of supply chain uncertainty and risk in the Australian courier industry. They are (1) company-side uncertainty and risk, (2) customer-side uncertainty and risk, and (3) environment uncertainty and risk. The results indicate high levels of reliability and validity of the measurement. This measurement model contributes to the supply chain uncertainty and risk literature. In addition, it provides an insight into assess supply chain uncertainty and risk in an industry.

TI Research Opportunities in Supply Chain Transparency
SO PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB More firms than ever before are disclosing the provenance of their products, results of product testing, and suppliers' compliance with labor-practice norms in their annual reports, sustainability reports, and press releases, besides making such information available on third-party websites. However, collecting and disclosing such information is not only costly but also does not provide clear benefits. While the terminology is not yet standard in the literature, this study distinguishes supply chain transparency from visibility. Here, visibility refers to managers' efforts to learn more about operations upstream in their supply chains. In contrast, by transparency, we mean a company disclosing information to consumers, investors, and other stakeholders about compliance with consumer-expected norms in its supply chain operations and products. To motivate further research on supply chain transparency, we first report recent examples of companies providing supply chain transparency. Then we present potential benefits of supply chain visibility and supply chain transparency, respectively, for the company. Finally, we propose topics for research on supply chain transparency arranged by stakeholder.

TI Corporate social responsibility and decision analysis in a supply chain
   through government subsidy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With rapid economic development, related social issues have become more prominent than before. How to effectively encourage enterprises to undertake more corporate social responsibility (CSR) and maintain the sustainable development of society has become an urgent task for managers and researchers to resolve. With respect to decision problems of a retailer-dominated supply chain considering CSR under government subsidy, based on game analysis technology, we establish a three-stage Stackelberg game model that consists of the government, a dominant retailer and n suppliers, and exploit it for analyzing the optimal decisions either with or without government subsidy, and explore the impact of the government subsidy on the profits of the members of the supply chain, the CSR effort level and social welfare in the retailer-dominated supply chain, and determine the relationship between the optimal government subsidy rate and CSR level. Our results show that the higher the effort level is, the more positive effect on the profits the whole supply chain experiences. Compared with those situations under non-government subsidies, a certain range of government subsidies can promote the supply-chain members to undertake CSR and improve overall performance of the supply chain and the welfare of the society.

TI Impact of Ecological Factors on Nationwide Supply Chain Performance
SO EKOLOJI
AB Environmental responsibility is an integrated part of responsible supply chain management and involves several steps. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of ecological factors in the supply chain. Therefore, this study examined the role of GDP growth rate, the degree of openess, the rate of exchange and balance of payment effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) and FDI effect on the supply chain. Different national and international frameworks and tools guide companies in their work with sustainability and environmental supply chain management. UN's Global Compact is one of the main international frameworks. In this study, data were collected from Indonesian ecologists. Email addresses of Indonesian ecologists were collected and email was sent to them to get responses. Only one hundred email addresses were found of various ecologists. Therefore, the total sample size was one hundred. From total one hundred, sixty ecologists responded. Outcomes of the study show that increases in GDP growth rate, the degree of openness and balance of payment increases the nationwide supply chain performance. Decreases in GDP growth rate, the degree of openness and balance of payment decreases the nationwide supply chain performance. However, increases in the rate of exchange decrease the FDI growth rate which ultimately decreases the supply chain practices.

CY MAY 14-17, 2018
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB The main objectives of this work is the development, implementation and evaluation of biomass supply chains from"green"agricultural residues for the production of energy products (solid biofuels, energy) through specific field trials, testing of energy exploitation technologies and related techno-economic and environmental assessments. For that purpose, two major categories of biomass were selected, straw and corn residues, as well aspruning, including urban tree's clearing and forest residues. The work will be implemented in three regions in Greece, wherethere are sufficient quantities of residues that concern the action. Furthermore, in these areas there isalready interest from existing biomass units for the management and utilization of agricultural residues. The sustainability assessment and local impacts assessment of potential supply chains through life-cycle and life-cycle-cost analysis as well as socio-economic analysis will ensure the overall assessment of the supply chain performance. The management of "green"agricultural residues for energy exploitation and the development of efficient supply chains will support the higher penetration of biomass in the national energy balance providing also environmental benefits.

TI Closed-loop supply chain system with energy, transportation and waste
   disposal costs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING
AB Energy usage and consumption play important and strategic roles in modern manufacturing, inventory and logistics systems. The literature on inventory models for closed-loop supply chains reveals that, for no clear reasons, energy costs were ignored along with transportation and disposal costs. This paper introduces a closed-loop supply chain model that considers the economic value and energy content of products. It also offers a novel framework for studying lot-sizing policies of production processes in that context. Thus, a mathematical model for a closed-loop supply chain system with energy, transportation and disposal costs is developed. Numerical examples are provided with their results discussed. The developed model was also compared to that of Richter (1996) to stress the importance of accounting for the three noted costs. The numerical results emphasise that accounting for energy, transportation and disposal costs in supply chain modelling increases the sustainability of a production-inventory system due to the strong interdependence of the three costs on one hand, and their relationship to the environment on the other hand.

TI Using Malmquist Productivity Index in a Two-Stage Sustainable Supply
   Chain
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EXTENSION
AB Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used as a tool to evaluate a set of decision-making units (DMUs) forming a sustainable supply chain (SSC). Furthermore, the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is used to determine the level of progress or regression in the DMUs. In this paper, we calculate the MPI in a sustainable supply chain using non-radial DEA models. Therefore, a non-radial Enhanced Russell model in two-stage supply chain is proposed to determine the efficiency of each DMU by considering economic, social and environmental sustainability factors. Thus, in this paper, MPI is calculated in a sustainable supply chain using the non-radial Enhanced Russell Measure (ERM). The proposed model considers the priority of decreasing inputs and increasing outputs by the decision-maker. Moreover, our applied study involves an evaluation of sustainable supply chains in Iranian oil refineries.

TI Sustainable supply chain integration: An exploration of South African
   fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
AB Background: Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are facing new challenges that compel them to outperform their competitors economically, and to consider environmental and social impacts. Customer demands regarding sustainability are channelled upstream to these manufacturers through retailers. This resulted in manufacturers being very conscious of the sustainability of their production processes, as well as their packaging. To that extent, FMCG manufacturers are encouraged to integrate sustainability, with other supply chain partners, to improve sustainability performance across the supply chain. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which FMCG manufacturers in South Africa apply sustainability to their supply chain integration. Setting: The study was conducted among South African FMCG manufacturers. Method: The study applied a generic qualitative research design. Altogether 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with middle to senior supply chain managers. Results: Having a clear sustainability focus, supported by leadership and embedded into the corporate culture, is key to integrating sustainability internally and thus improving the sustainability performance. The findings indicate that customers do not pressure firms to adhere to their sustainability expectations. Instead, sustainability expectations are driven internally. Firms find it difficult to align the three sustainability aspects equally, due to the local variables and context in which they operate. Therefore, economic sustainability is considered most important and firms act on environmental and social sustainability aspects within strict economic constraints. Conclusion: Academically, the study adds to the literature by creating an understanding of sustainable supply chain integration (SSCI) from a South African perspective. For practitioners, the study encourages firms to collaborate with supply chain partners on sustainability, as this opens up opportunities to create shared value through joint sustainability problem-solving.

TI Embedding attributes towards the supply chain performance measurement
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB Dependency on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is inadequate in the context of sustainability, environment, and other multiple factors along with the changes in the market dynamics. As a result, performance evaluation through a holistic approach in the manufacturing industry is not comprehensive. Therefore, a Supply Chain Performance Measurement (SCPM) is required to assess the supply chain's effectiveness. This research formulates Integrated Supply Chain Performance Measurement (ISCPM) model through the supply chain performance attributes in the outlook of input-process-output considering the BSC and the SCOR model at three decisions levels with an application of quantitative techniques to bring synergic effect to all stakeholder issues. A gap analysis was performed through systematic literature reviews. The integrated supply chain performance measurement model incorporates ten supply chain performance measurement attributes supplier relationship management (SRM), internal supply chain management (ISCM), and customer relationship management (CRM). The model was then tested from the various sectors in the manufacturing industry of Bangladesh, through a simple random sampling. The ISCPM model furnishes stakeholders of the manufacturing supply chain with the appropriate strategies to review and appraise their performance toward fulfillment of the ultimate goals. This model is suggested to be implemented in manufacturing industries to improve their operational performance. The study contributes to academia developing the ISCPM model with ten performance measurement attributes that enrich the literature on SCPM. It also contributes to the industry for practitioners by bringing synergy into the framework and performance measurement attributes which eventually upgrade the prosperity of the manufacturing industry and eventually the society.

TI IMPACT OF SUSTAINABILITY ON SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS IN MANUFACTURING
   INDUSTRIES - AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB Today's manufacturing industries are forced to work under dynamic and uncertain environment which makes the supply chain vulnerable to risk. Also, the stake holders are becoming aware of world's environmental problems. So, the supply chain must be made sustainable to protect environment and to reduce the impact of risk. This research aims to empirically investigate the impact of sustainability on supply chain risks in manufacturing industries. A survey instrument was designed to collect the response from 300 manufacturing industries. The collected data was checked for reliability, content validity and convergent validity using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and analysed by Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structure) software. The results obtained shows that sustainability practices in the supply chain have a positive impact on supply chain risk like environmental risks, demand risks, etc. and thus supported the hypothesis.

TI Green supply chain contracts with eco-labels issued by the sales
   platform: profitability and environmental implications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Considering environmentally conscious consumers, a manufacturer, and a sales platform which provides eco-labels for qualified manufacturers, this paper develops a supply chain model to study how eco-labels affect green supply chain operations, from the profitability and environmental perspectives. The results show that the sales platform prefers the agency contract, but the manufacturer prefers the wholesale price contract. Considering the performance of the supply chain, the agency contract brings a higher profit while the wholesale price contract results in a bigger environmental improvement. An unexpected but interesting result is that when the agency contract is used and consumer green awareness increases, the sale price declines rather than increasing as it does under the wholesale price contract. This decline happens because the required marketing effort of the sales platform will be lower, which incentivises the platform to reduce the commission rate. Consequently, the manufacturer faces a lower commission rate and a higher margin when consumers display greater green awareness. Moreover, as the core and more powerful player of the supply chain, the sales platform can propose a platform-led revenue sharing contract to fully coordinate the supply chain, which improves the performance of the supply chain both in profitability and environmental perspectives.

TI Balancing gas supply and demand with a sustainable gas supply chain - A
   study based on field data
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The possibilities of balancing gas supply and demand with a green gas supply chain were analyzed. The considered supply chain is based on co-digestion of cow manure and maize, the produced biogas is upgraded to (Dutch) natural gas standards. The applicability of modeling yearly gas demand data in a geographical region by Fourier analysis was investigated. For a sine shape gas demand, three scenarios were further investigated: varying biogas production in time, adding gas storage to a supply chain, and adding a second digester to the supply chain which is assumed to be switched off during the summer months. A regional gas demand modeled by a sine function is reasonable for household type of users as well as for business areas, or a mixture of those. Of the considered scenarios, gas storage is by far the most expensive. When gas demand has to be met by a green gas supply chain, flexible biogas production is an interesting option. Further research in this direction might open interesting pathways to sustainable gas supply chains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Green Product Supply Chain Coordination Under Demand Uncertainty
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The problem of coordinating a two-echelon green product supply chain with environmentally conscious consumers under demand uncertainty is studied in this paper. In the green product supply chain, a manufacturer produces green product through developing green technology and a retailer promotes the green product through green marketing. The demand of the green product is uncertain with the mean and the variance as the only known information. After analyzing the utility that a consumer gained from the green product, the problem is then formulated as a distribution-free-based Stackelberg game for a decentralized system under three contracts, i.e., wholesale price-only (WPO), revenue and green marketing cost-sharing (RGMS), and two-part tariff (TPTF) contracts. The analytical results are also proposed to show the effects of the system parameters on supply chain optimal decisions. By comparing with the centralized system, the coordination level for each contract is investigated. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis with respect to several system parameters are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the contracts under demand uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both RGMS and TPTF contracts are superior to WPO contract. Especially, TPTF contract can always coordinate the supply chain, while RGMS contract can improve the supply chain coordination level only if the revenue and cost sharing coefficients satisfy certain conditions.

TI Offsite construction supply chain strategies for matching affordable
   rental housing demand: A system dynamics approach
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Australian housing affordability is influenced by both housing supply and demand factors. These factors include lengthy construction and planning process. The affordability crisis affects the housing rental sector, which accommodates more than 20 % of Australian household. This research developed a system dynamics model to simulate demography-linked affordable rental housing demand and supply in South East Queensland (SEQ). A Prefabricated Offsite Construction (OSC) housing supply strategy is compared with a traditional building approach (BAU) to investigate the effectiveness of OSC techniques to reduce informational asymmetries during development planning stages to deliver better affordable rental housing is linked to housing needs in SEQ. The model focuses on demographic groups housing demand of one, two- and three-bedroom apartment units and examines how reductions in the development process, through OSC methods, influence the efficiency of Government supported affordable rental housing supply schemes. Overall, the study finds that reduced planning and construction timeframes through OSC methods may improve demography-linked rental housing supply by approximately 6.6 % overall compared to BAU in SEQ. For 1,2- and 3-bedroom apartment demand, OSC strategies are expected to improve supply efficiency by 8.7 %, 8.4 % and 9.2 %, respectively. Optimal OSC strategies were assessed and found that flexibility in development sizes have an outsized positive effect. The study has implications for Government supported affordable rental housing strategies, including the build to rent sector.

TI Quantitative Model for Supply Chain Visibility: Process Capability
   Perspective
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Currently, the intensity of enterprise competition has increased as a result of a greater diversity of customer needs as well as the persistence of a long-term recession. The results of competition are becoming severe enough to determine the survival of company. To survive global competition, each firm must focus on achieving innovation excellence and operational excellence as core competency for sustainable competitive advantage. Supply chain management is now regarded as one of the most effective innovation initiatives to achieve operational excellence, and its importance has become ever more apparent. However, few companies effectively manage their supply chains, and the greatest difficulty is in achieving supply chain visibility. Many companies still suffer from a lack of visibility, and in spite of extensive research and the availability of modern technologies, the concepts and quantification methods to increase supply chain visibility are still ambiguous. Based on the extant researches in supply chain visibility, this study proposes an extended visibility concept focusing on a process capability perspective and suggests a more quantitative model using Z score in Six Sigma methodology to evaluate and improve the level of supply chain visibility.

TI A DEMATEL based approach for investigating barriers in green supply
   chain management in Canadian manufacturing firms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) involves consideration of environmental impacts of all the processes involved in a typical supply chain to minimise their negative consequences. In this paper, we present a DEMATEL-based approach for investigating barriers in GSCM in Canadian context. Seven manufacturing firms from electronic goods sector are involved. The results of our study yield three main categories of barriers. These barriers are knowledge-related (lack of awareness of the environmental impacts on business, lack of training courses/consultancy/institutions to train, monitor/mentor progress specific to each industry, lack of technical expertise and difficulty in identifying environmental opportunities), commitment-related (lack of corporate social responsibility) and product design-related (complexity of design to reuse/recycle used products). The proposed study is one of the first few to be conducted in the Canadian context for green supply chain barrier analysis for electronic goods sector. Secondly, the barriers are investigated through causality and prominence relations which can help decision-makers, policy planners and managers of organisations in addressing those critical few for making green supply chain practices a success.

AB Recent supply chain accidents due to epidemics, terrorist attacks, and severe earthquake in Haiti killing thousands of people, as well as typhoon over Manila causing flood to wash out millions worth of property, indicate that firms are vulnerable in today's highly integrated supply chains. Global financial crisis started in the mid 2007 has also brought further implications on supply chain problems. As economic recession reached the bottom line, manufacturing managers experienced a different kind of risks exposing supply chain vulnerability. The effectiveness of supply chain mitigation strategy, which provide a greater ability to respond volatile circumstances is an immediate important. This study explores the perspectives of managers in the manufacturing firms on supply chain vulnerability and mitigation measures within Indonesian environment. The result reveals that supply chain vulnerability is a relatively new concept for them. However, their firms have implemented certain mitigation actions to avoid fatality in the supply chain network.

AB This paper will enlighten the problem of illegal housing in unconventional way - by trying to understand the illegal settlements as areas of social/affordable housing and social integration. It will also discuss the possibilities of urban upgrading and regeneration of illegal settlements making them liveable places and areas which can be integrated into the Belgrade development. On one hand, Serbia is, like some other developing countries, facing the problems of socially and spatially incoherent urban development and of integration of special socio-economic groups, while on the other there is an issue of tackling the untamed urban growth in the form of illegal settlements in suburb areas. These problems are closely related to the lack of adequate affordable housing and its capacity. Having this in mind, it is understandable that Serbia is coping with even bigger problem of affordable and social housing than it is the case with developed EU countries. The pressure of these problems is more visible in Belgrade, Serbian capital since it deals with the demographic pressure and immigrants more than any other Serbian city over past four decades. As a consequence of this pressure many previously agriculture areas at the fringes of the city have become illegal urban sprawls. As the time has proven, the country did not manage to limit the informal growth in the acceptable manner, neither through restrictive policy and plans, nor through the legalization process. At the same time, being a severely hit by economic crisis in past few years, Serbia will not easily reform its housing policy and enable growth of the typical affordable housing which will meet demands. Having all in mind, this paper will try to present a different prospective which relies upon the integrative approach to these problems and which is based on the idea of new form of social housing and transformed and upgraded informal settlements. Furthermore, it will offer the directions and measures for the planning actions that would meet the objectives of social integration and cohesion and would contribute to the solving of social housing problem within the social sustainability development framework.(1)

TI Sustainable Supply Chain Management: A Comprehensive Systematic Review
   of Industrial Practices
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable business practices are those that allow companies to increase their profit while still considering the triple bottom line of sustainability, which involves economic, environmental, and social aspects. There are a lot of studies exploring various aspects of supply chain practices. However, there remains a gap for the proposal of a complete framework concerning various industries. This research fills this gap by studying existing empirical and review studies. Based on a content analysis of 86 studies, 789 practices are derived and categorized, leading to a comprehensive classification of sustainable practices in supply chains. Moreover, the employed methods to analyze the data are investigated. The practices are cross-checked versus the studied industries showing the current sustainable industries. The details of the studied papers are presented in a comprehensive table. The sustainable framework showing the industrial solutions toward sustainable supply chains is divided into 38 minor practices classified into 11 main categories. This paper provides a novel interpretation of the sustainable solutions addressed by different industries and presents a new and updated classification of the literature identifying future directions. This offers many advantages for practitioners and researchers to transform a supply chain into an improved version in the bigger picture.

AB Renewed global developmental priorities set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 provide a new impetus for businesses and organisations to improve sustainability practice. However, applying the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to managerial practice remains a challenge. There is a need for strategies, tools and models which would make the SDGs actionable by organisations. This book examines the advancement of management approaches towards embedding sustainability in supply chain relations from conceptual and practical aspects in both developed and emerging economies. Despite the improvements in sustainable supply chain management theory and practice, global supply chains and production networks still face mounting environmental, social and economic problems and result in negative impacts worldwide. Additionally, existing approaches in sustainable supply chain management are contested in the climate of post-global economy, where national policies and technological development may prioritise regional and national economic interests, presenting a new challenge for supply chain integration. The chapters in this book question how businesses and organisations can re-evaluate their practices and depart from a narrow view of mitigating negative social and environmental impacts towards actively contributing to sustainable development priorities in regional and organisational contexts.

TI Modern slavery in supply chains: a systematic literature review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Modern slavery is a complex and challenging phenomenon that may hinder the sustainable development of the global supply chain. However, there is no existing academic review on modern slavery in supply chains. This study conducts a systematic literature review to synthesise this body of literature. We searched keywords in the Scopus database and identified 44 articles published between 2013 and 2022 to identify critical themes and propose a conceptual framework capturing the relationships among the identified themes. Through our analysis, three themes of modern slavery in supply chains were identified: antecedents (analyzed from regulatory, organisational, and social perspectives); practices (e.g. practices to mitigate modern slavery in supply chains); and outcomes (e.g. business compliance). We conclude by proposing a research agenda to inform future research.

SO JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw upon the resource-based view of the firm to explore how a firm's resources (assets and capabilities) such as culture of competitiveness (CC) and knowledge development (KD) relate to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and organizational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 242 supply chain and logistics managers in Pakistan and a structured equation modeling approach was used. Findings The results of the study provide support for the proposed hypotheses and indicate that CC and KD are positively related to SSCM and OP. This points out that the organizations in Pakistan are likely to emphasize CC and KD to achieve OP. However, the positive but weak association of CC and KD with SSCM highlights that the organizations in Pakistan show less concern for SSCM. Originality/value The literature did not reveal any study which examined the relationships of the CC and KD to SSCM and OP in developing countries. The present study aims to address this gap in the literature.

SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM
AB Purpose: Outsourcing transactions have been arisen and evolved in the last years and purchase managers want to know if a Failure Mode Effects and Analysis (FMEA) is an effective qualitative technique to analyze supply chain risks (SCR) in a proper way. The aim of this study is to address this question developing a practicable risk management process based on the guidelines of the ISO 31000 for upstream Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) linking risk assessment, risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment and validate the process empirically through a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach: After a review of the literature on Sustainable Supply Chain Risk Management (SSCR1VI), a case study based on a leading manufacturer of electrical products, collects evidences of SSCRM implementation.
   Findings: Supply chain disruptions are one of the most critical issues which can negatively influence on firm's performance. Avoiding and mitigating disruptions in the supply chain is one of the main challenges for supply chain managers.
   Originality/value: This paper identifies the ISO 31000, the ISO 9001 and the use of an FMEA to analyze supply chain risks in a structured manner and to outline future research opportunities in the field of SCRM.

AB Supply chains of modern products are often characterized by globally dispersed activities that have ecological, economic, and social impacts. Life cycle-oriented sustainability assessment methods usually aim at compiling the total impacts of a product without explicitly considering their spatial distribution. This may be problematic because regional characteristics of technology and environment are ignored and opportunities for tradeoffs between local and global sustainability measures are hidden. This paper proposes a framework for spatially differentiated sustainability assessment to support the design of global supply chains. The framework comprises a resource flow model that links production processes to specific locations, multi-scale impact assessment to derive regional and global sustainability indicators, and multi-criteria evaluation balancing the preferences of different stakeholders. An illustrative example shows that the application of this framework to a simplified supply chain of beer production leads to different results when alternative supply chain structures are compared.

AB In palm oil supply chain, when the productivity and export market are being increased, usually the negative impacts to sustainability issues (economic, social, and environmental aspects) will arise. It also has direct impacts to supply chain itself, so it required to recognize the supply chain performance position. The objectives of this research were to evaluate performance, added value, and develop sustainability improvement strategies to increase performance of palm oil supply chain at X Co. Palm oil supply chain's performance measurement was obtained by SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) approach. It showed the performance level of plantation was above average (91.24%) and manufacture was at average (86.19%). Added value ratio was measured by using modified Hayami method. It showedthat the added valued of plantation and manufacture were 21.86% and 37.55% respectively. ANP (Analytical Network Process) method with BOCR (benefit, opportunity, cost, and risk) analysis was used in selecting sustainability improvement strategies to increase performance of palm oil supply chain, the weighting results showed that production plan's improvement was the highest.

SE International Series in Operations Research & Management Science
AB Over the last decade, the global chemical industry has experienced one of its worst economic storms in recent history. In their bids to get through the unprecedented long economic downturn and to survive in the new economic era, many chemical companies have turned to reconfiguring their supply chains and revamping their operations. Inevitably, these structural and operational transformations and recent developments in the sociopolitical environment have brought several supply chain operational issues to the fore. This paper focuses on three primary issues. First, it identifies the key characteristics of supply chains in the chemical industry, which warrant management approaches that differ from those of other industries. Second, it discusses extensively the latest trends in chemical supply chains and the key supply chain operational issues that have unfolded over recent years in the chemical industry. The highlights of latest supply chain trends and issues enable readers to gain a good insight of current status as well as short term future of chemical supply chains. Third, this paper gives a brief overview of research work that has been done to address supply chain operation problems. Besides identifying gaps in the field of supply chain operation research, industrially relevant research opportunities that are gaining researchers' interests are also distinguished in this work.

TI Prediction of Supply Chain Financial Credit Risk Based on PCA-GA-SVM
   Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Supply Chain Finance (SCF) is a new type of financing business carried out by commercial banks on the basis of supply chain management, which effectively promotes the healthy development of the supply chain. As the most typical mode of SCF, accounts receivable financing mode can use the part of accounts receivable occupying working capital for financing, which is widely used. In order to effectively manage the credit risk in the Supply Chain Finance and maintain the healthy operation of the supply chain, this paper proposes a supply chain financial credit risk prediction model based on PCA-GA-SVM. First, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the original index system, and then genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the principal components selected by PCA are input into the GA-SVM model for training, and the final prediction model is established. The running results show that the prediction performance of PCA-GA-SVM model is better than that of SVM and GA-SVM models. It has a good generalization ability, which can be used as a reference for commercial banks to improve the credit risk management ability of Supply Chain Finance and is conducive to the sustainable development of supply chain finance business.

AB Nowadays, sustainability has gained much attention from economists, environmentalists, consumers, industrialists, government and the academia. The regulatory policies for carbon emissions force the firms to redesign its supply chain. In this paper, different production-distribution and inventory problems in multi-echelon supply chain were critically investigated with three carbon policies (carbon tax, strict carbon capping and carbon cap-and-trade) and lead-time considerations. Then, a non-linear mixed-integer programming based mathematical model has been developed and tested with the proposed heuristic. The obtained results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed algorithm that can further help the policy makers and experts for designing and evaluation of sustainable supply chain.

TI Does bad press help or hinder sustainable supply chain management? An
   empirical investigation of US-based corporations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB This study explores the effect of negative news about an organization on its sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. We focus on how public reports about controversial business practices motivate a company to make adjustments so that environmental and social concerns are better included in its supply chain management practices. Using agenda-setting theory, we identify managerial commitment as an important factor in transmitting external media pressure. We analyse longitudinal data, ranging from 2002 through 2014 and collected for more than 700 US-based corporations. Our findings reveal that companies significantly increase SSCM after being the subject of negative news, particularly when management commitment to environmental sustainability and social welfare is high. Our findings should encourage supply chain decision makers to consider more broadly how external stakeholders view their global supply chain operations. Our research sheds light on negative news as an external factor; previous literature used media attention as anecdotal evidence and focused more on internal company factors. We contribute to research in SSCM by studying the mediation effect. It is essential that supply chain decision makers better apprehend the importance of negative news, management commitment, and SSCM and understand their role in influencing public opinion.

TI The Effects of Innovation Adoption and Social Factors between
   Sustainable Supply Chain Management Practices and Sustainable Firm
   Performance: A Moderated Mediation Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The aim of this study was to develop higher-order scales for assessing sustainable supply chain management practices, innovation adoption, and sustainable firm performance in the restaurant sector. Three different higher-order scales were developed for assessing the SSCM, SFP and innovation adoption. The first scale for SSCM higher-order construct consisted of service-product supply chain management practices (SPSSCM), service-setting supply chain management practices (SSSSCM), and service-delivery supply chain management practices (SDSSCM). The second higher-order scale for sustainable firm performance (SFP) consisted of economic, operational, environmental, and socio-cultural performance. The third higher-order scale for innovation adoption (INNO) consisted of "product- and process-based innovation", "marketing-based innovation", "technology-based innovation" and "organizational innovation". The face, content, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity was tested using pilot study, expert opinion, EFA, and CFA. With 178 responses collected from restaurateurs, managers, and supervisors of casual restaurants in Prachuap Khiri Khan province in Thailand, this study evaluates the direct effects of SSCM on SFP. It further evaluates the mediating role of innovation adoption between sustainable supply chain management practices and firm performance and the moderated mediation effects of socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, education, and experience. The results reveal that sustainable supply chain management practices can positively lead to sustainable firm performance. However, irrespective of the indirect effects of socio-demographic factors, adopting innovation completely mediates the relationship between sustainable supply chain management practices and firm performance.

AB Fast Moving Electrical Goods (FMEG) industries are among the most dynamic industry these days. Short product life cycle, intricate supply chain, unpredictable demand, tight profit margins are major challenges for FMEG industries. Scarcity of rawmaterial, unpredictable delay in transportation from foreign suppliers, non-availability of affordable skilled labor, changing customer demand have completely transformed the electric goods industries. Increasing demand for good-quality low-cost products is giving abundant opportunities of growth to FMEG industries if they manage issues and challenges of supply chain management (SCM). In this research paper, authors have studied the issues and challenges of FMEG supply chain using situation actor process-learning action performance (SAP-LAP) methodology. Authors have observed that Indian FMEG are facing challenges like supply chain collaboration (outsourcing of non-core operations, vertically integrating core competencies), retail integration, supply risk management (natural, terrorism, demand and supply), supply chain planning (demand-driven supply chains), reverse logistic, sustainability, and green supply chain and digital supply chain.

TI The mediating role of supply chain collaboration on the relationship
   between information technology and innovation
SO JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The high level of competition in the globalized business environment forces companies to innovate to remain competitive. Previous literature often cites information technology (IT) and supply chain collaboration as direct contributors to product innovation and IT as a direct enabler of supply chain collaboration. This suggests that IT could have an indirect effect on product innovation through supply chain collaboration, although this relationship has not been addressed yet. This paper aims to analyze empirically the direct impacts of IT and supply chain collaboration on incremental and radical product innovation and the indirect effect of IT on both types of product innovation through supply chain collaboration by using data collected from a sample of 200 manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling was used to check the research hypotheses with a sample of 200 manufacturing companies. Findings The results show supply chain collaboration has a positive effect on technological innovation, showing that the collaboration with external agents foster both incremental and radical innovations. Furthermore, results show that IT directly enhances both types of product innovation (incremental and radical) indirectly through supply chain collaboration.
   Originality/value This paper focus on the indirect effect of IT on product innovation through the creation of the collaborations with external agents. In spite of the importance of this relation, it has been poorly studied by previous literature. The paper's greatest interest lies in the fact that ITs not only facilitate the transmission of knowledge but also facilitate other types of behavior among supply chain agents that invite collaboration and generate innovations.

TI MANAGING A SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN - STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF NATURAL
   RESOURCES IN THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY
SO MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN PRODUCTION ENGINEERING
AB Managing a sustainable supply chain is a concept related to many areas of the economy. Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.

TI Selected sustainability aspects for supply chain data exchange: Towards
   a supply chain-wide sustainability assessment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In a context of growing complexity of supply chains and pressure from multiple stakeholders for more transparency, there is a trend in research and practice towards building methods for supply chain sustainability assessment. This trend represents a core issue in research but rarely takes a multiple stakeholder perspective. Based on a literature review, a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of sustainability reports, a survey, and interviews with various stakeholders, this paper suggests a set of sustainability aspects to exchange data to support the sustainability assessment of supply chains. The focus is set on the inter-related automotive and electronics industries which are representative sectors of this growing need for transparency and assessment and reflect the complexity of the issue. The outcome and main differences between companies and other stakeholders (e.g., Non-Governmental Organisations, researchers) is highlighted as well as the overall result of this work: a suggestion for 36 sustain ability aspects to exchange sustainability data along the supply chain. By integrating empirical information, this paper emphasises the need to define precisely which sustainability aspects can be found in the different dimensions of sustainability and shows the importance of the governance dimension in sustainability research. It also aims at encouraging a standardised data exchange by taking into account company demographics and data exchange accessibility to allow comparability between companies and supply chains and support decision-makers. The results are meant for companies to improve and monitor the sustainability performance of their organisation and supply chain, improve communication through corporate sustainability reports, and provide more transparent information to customers and final consumers. The results also aim at supporting researchers in the field in developing indicators for a supply chain-wide sustainability assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show the main benefits of collaboration in sustainable supply chain. Our approach is hierarchical and based on simulation. In order to show the benefits of collaboration we simulate and then we compare three scenarios modeling the spring mix supply chain. The first one is without collaboration; the second is with vertical collaboration and the third is with horizontal collaboration. Numerical results show the impact of collaboration on three bottom lines.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainability and environmental concerns have been important topics of discussion in recent decades. Green supply chain management assures the effectiveness of public and company policies in greening their operations, increasing the market share, improving the company image and reputation, and increasing profits. The objective of this article is to propose a conceptual framework that considers dimensions, categories, and practices in green supply chain management. After an extensive review of the literature, we identified models and a set of green dimensions, categories, and practices used for green supply chain management. From the analysis of the findings, we propose a conceptual framework that is organized into 3 environmental dimensions, 21 categories, and 64 green practices. The framework can contribute to the literature, given that empirical studies mostly select a limited set of dimensions to evaluate supply chain green practices. Finally, this study offers directions for future research.

TI Exploring the utilization of a CONWIP system for supply chain
   management. A comparison with fully integrated supply chains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Some authors have developed important advances in order to integrate and improve the performance of the supply chain (SC), by sharing information through communication technologies with a decentralized approach. An alternative to improve the performance in an SC may be to introduce a CONWIP supply chain (CONWIP SC) policy with a centralized approach in the supply chain management. In this paper we review the literature to present the benefits of the CONWIP system in different production environments and discuss the possible utilization of this system to manage the entire supply chain. A characterization of the CONWIP-based approach to supply chain management is presented, and a simulation model to explore and evaluate the advantages of this strategy, in comparison with a fully integrated supply chain (FI SC) is developed. We carry on this analysis for different levels of demand volatility and material flow constraints along the chain, and we optimize parameters to ensure the best performance of each control supply chain policy in each scenario. Our research shows that CONWIP SC policy may offer advantages and improved performances in global metrics while both policies offer similar service levels. Main advantages are smaller average of orders placed, less impact of demand variability on the ordering policy, shorter average finished goods inventory and work in process levels and potential inventory cost, substantial comparative funds savings to run the business model, and easier control of inventories.

TI Shareholding operation of product remanufacturing - from a sustainable
   production perspective
SO RAIRO-OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB We consider a supply chain in which an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) authorizes the remanufacturing business to a third-party remanufacturer (TPR). The OEM may make an investment to hold equity in TPR. This operation not only enables OEM to share the profit of the TPR as a forward shareholding supply chain, but also improve the production efficiency of the TPR and consequently benefits the whole supply chain. We characterize the equilibrium production decisions of all members by using Stackelberg game in such a supply chain. We find that shareholding operation by OEM helps increase the production quantity of remanufactured products and total market volume. From the economic perspective, our results show both sides in the forward shareholding supply chain prefer the shareholding operation if the equity holding cost and remanufactured cost is relatively small. Additionally, from an environmental perspective, our results show under certain relative pollution ratio of remanufactured products, shareholding operation can reduce environmental impact. Finally, we check the key results by stimulating numerical examples and obtain some useful management insights.

AB This paper established a three-level supply chain composed of plants, distribution centers, and retailers, and studied the location of distribution centers in the supply chain network and the carbon emissions during processing and transportation. In a random and fuzzy environment, the research objective is to minimize the supply chain's cost and carbon emission. The multi-objective uncertain equilibrium model of the green supply chain network is established by introducing opportunity constraints, and the stability of the model can be enhanced by using variance function and risk function. Then this research integrated the theory of stochastic programming and fuzzy mathematical programming and employed Monte Carlo simulation; the sample mean approximation, chance-constrained programming and fuzzy expectation to deal with the random parameters and fuzzy parameters in the model so that the uncertain model is clarified. Further, the authors used the hierarchical method, the weighted ideal point method, restriction method, and weighted ideal point method to solve the multi-objective model. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the model.

Transportation and logistics can improve the economic growth of nations and profitability in businesses, and if efficiently designed and managed their carbon footprints will be reduced. Important progresses have been made to enhance the efficiency of logistics supply chain using mathematical optimisation techniques. However, recent needs in collaborative supply chain on one hand, and advancements in data science have heightened the need for optimisation techniques based on big data analytics. This paper studies and evaluates models for European freight transport logistics actions utilising advanced data analytics solutions. Three new supply chain algorithms of horizontal collaboration, pooling, and physical internet have been developed using historical data of European road freight transport. Then, two indicators of sustainability and efficiency were used to evaluate each developed strategy. The results have shown that there is substantial potential in pursuing these strategies and encourages future research into logistic supply chain and data analytic methods for designing sustainable transport systems.

AB Traditionally, supply chains have been evaluated according to economic criteria only. On this basis, supply chain best practices like outsourcing, offshoring and centralization of production or warehousing facilities have been developed. These best practices have usually led to an improvement of the economic performance measures but they often go hand in hand with an increase in transportation activity and the related carbon emissions. As such a development is not sustainable the traditional evaluation of supply chain strategies based on the two criteria costs and customer service has to be complemented by a third dimension that measures the environmental sustainability of a supply chain design. We present the results of a project funded by the European Commission which aims at developing sustainable logistics and manufacturing systems considering the there dimensions cost, customer service and carbon emissions. The results are derived from different research approaches, such as literature review, model-based analysis, case studies and expert interviews. Based on the scenarios and recommendations for policy-making will be derived.

TI Multi-tier sustainable supply chain management: The role of supply chain
   leadership
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) has been considered increasingly important by both industry and academia in recent years. Among the main streams of SSCM research, little is known on how multi-national corporations (MNCs), assuming leadership in their supply chain, have been able to facilitate their supply chain members to learn sustainability practice in an emerging economy context. To answer this research question, a multiple-case study was designed. Multi-tier supply chains of three MNCs were selected to investigate their proactive sustainability projects in China. A framework was proposed based on the constructs of supply chain leadership, multi-tier supply chain governance, multi-tier supply chain structure and supply chain learning. We found that the combined effect of supply chain leadership and governance mechanisms affects both supply chain structure and supply chain learning and MNCs change their supply chain structure to facilitate supply chain learning. Three sets of propositions are advanced and implications for future research are elucidated.

TI Local, Mixed and Global Organic Tomato Supply Chains: Some Lessons
   Learned from a Real-World Case Study
SO SOCIO-METABOLIC PERSPECTIVES ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF LOCAL FOOD
   SYSTEMS: INSIGHTS FOR SCIENCE, POLICY AND PRACTICE
SE Human-Environment Interactions
AB This chapter presents the evaluation of three organic tomato supply chains in Catalonia ( Spain): the Local and Global supply chains, and a Mixed supply chain. The evaluation is based on a set of multidimensional indicators derived from different narratives: Commodity, Environmental and Livelihoods. In so doing, we identified the main challenges when implementing the supply chain approach, and propose some recommendations for its application. The supply chain approach proves to be very useful in identifying the critical points at which to intervene and/or improve the performance of food supply chains, but presents some disadvantages when it is used to compare the sustainability of food supply chains. Finally, we show that organic production is not enough to achieve a sustainable food provision system, and the context and the food supply chain in which organic food is commercialised also determine the sustainability of organic food production.

TI Identifying viewpoints on innovation in low-input and organic dairy
   supply chains: A Q-methodological study
SO FOOD POLICY
AB In a rapidly changing ecological, economic and political environment, environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient farming systems are required (SCAR, 2008). The development and adoption of innovation are critical to improve the competitiveness of organic and low-input dairy systems. Understanding the viewpoints of dairy supply-chain members on acceptable innovation is important to be able to improve organic and low-input dairy supply chains. This study uses Stephenson's Q methodology to investigate the opinions of organic and low-input dairy supply-chain members in relation to innovation in the dairy sector. A sample of dairy supply-chain members (consumers, farmers, retailers, processors) was recruited from each European country involved in the study (Belgium, Italy, Finland, the United Kingdom). On the one hand, the data show a high degree of consensus across all of the participants within the supply chain, for whom innovations were deemed not to be acceptable in organic (from an ethical and/or regulatory perspective) and low-input dairy systems. On the other hand, the consumer views of acceptable dairy innovations were centred around animal welfare, while the farmers and processors/retailers preferred innovations related to feed quality, feed efficiency, and soil management. This study illustrates the value of Q methodology in eliciting subjectivities about food-policy-related issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLOTHING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose This paper studies the textile supply chain tactical planning under demand fuzziness through considering environmentally friendly and social responsibility. Hence, carbon emission in textile production and transportation is considered along with supply chain profitability. Design/methodology/approach The authors present a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical optimization model with credibilistic chance constraints to determine the fabric procurement quantities and production plan under uncertainty. The solution procedure makes use of credibility measure and fuzzy aggregation operator to attain compromise solutions. Findings A trade-off among carbon emissions, social performance and supply chain total profit is conducted. The analyses indicate the importance of transportation costs and carbon emission while determining the supply chain's tactical plan. Originality/value The textile supply chain's social sustainability alongside carbon emissions of textile operations is contemplated to provide apparel production and distribution logistics planning under uncertainty. In doing so, the authors propose a hybrid credibility-possibility mathematical optimization model to determine a compromise solution for textile managers.

TI Competitive Green Supply Chain Transformation with Dynamic
   Capabilities-An Exploratory Case Study of Chinese Electronics Industry
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Extant studies identify different strategic approaches for businesses to integrate environment management (EM) into corporate supply chain management (SCM) to create different competitive market advantages. With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industry-one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified.

AB Solar energy gains are among the most important aspects in the design of very low energy buildings like passive houses. An optimization of solar gains reduces the required heating demand, however too high solar gains can lead to overheating issues.
   Most methods for building energy ratings and building energy certificates use a monthly balance based calculation procedure. Also the current methodology for passive house assessment and certification is a monthly balance based one. To incorporate shading by fixed elements as an influence on solar gains into those methods, some simplifications are necessary.
   This paper discusses the current implementation of the shading calculation in the passive house verification method. Based on comparison tests of the current method with an advanced shading calculation method shortcomings of the existing method are discussed. It is shown that the current algorithms for static calculation sometimes give erroneous and unreliable results. The impact on the different assessment criteria, energy demand and loads as well as overheating, exceeds acceptable margins of error. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Assessment of risk in the management of Halal supply chain using fuzzy
   BWM method
SO SUPPLY CHAIN FORUM
AB In the volatile globalised market, risk management of the supply chain is essential, but it becomes vital to the management of faith-based supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to identify and prioritise risk dimensions and their associated risk elements as required for managing a Halal supply chain. Initially, 42 risk elements of the Halal supply chain are identified through literature review and categorised into seven dimensions with the opinion of an expert team. Further, fuzzy BWM is applied to prioritise these risk dimensions and associated risk elements. The finding suggests that the production-related risks are highly significant, while sustainability-related risks are least significant among the identified risk dimensions in the Halal supply chain management. The mitigation of the production- and planning-related risks is to be addressed on priority. This study's significant contribution is to provide a comprehensive list of risks related to the Halal supply chain management and their prioritisation towards effective management of the same.

TI A Framework of Sustainable Service Supply Chain Management: A Literature
   Review and Research Agenda
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, the interdisciplinary research of supply chains and sustainability has received extensive, yet gradual, attention; when compared to the rapid economic growth of the service industry, however, sustainable supply chain management has not been systematically explored yet. It has not only great theoretical significance, but also positive practical significance to provide a framework for the operation of a sustainable service supply chain from a sustainable development point of view. Based on the triple bottom line (TBL), we have analyzed related sustainable supply chain management research between 2006 and 2015, reviewed papers involving two or three bottom lines as well, and then introduced some classical frameworks for manufacturing supply chain management and service supply chain management. Afterward, by analyzing the differences between the manufacturing and service industries, we propose a framework of sustainable service supply chain management (SSSCM). Based on the impacts of sustainable development TBL on service supply chain participants, we have finally made a framework for sustainable operation facing triads service supply chain and proposed a future research agenda.

TI Experiences from nine passive houses in Sweden - Indoor thermal
   environment and energy use
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper presents experiences from a recently built area with passive houses in Linkoping, Sweden and compares them with conventional buildings, mainly from an indoor environment perspective, but also based on energy use. The built area consists of 39 recently constructed terraced houses, of which nine are built according to the passive house standard. The aspects of thermal comfort as well as local discomfort are studied. The methodology is based on on-site measurements and two types of simulations - CFD and Building Energy Simulation. In addition a post-occupancy evaluation was made using a standardized questionnaire to relate the occupant's perception of the indoor environment one year after the buildings were completed.
   The thermal comfort for these newly built passive houses is well within the limits in the local building code. However, some interesting findings related to local comfort such as cold floors are found in the post-occupancy evaluation as well as in the predictions. The occupants of the passive houses experience cold floors to a higher degree than in the conventional buildings. It was also shown that there are a higher number of complaints related to high temperatures during summer in the passive houses. It is worth noting that the buildings do not have external shading installed by default. The effect of varying temperatures was also observed in the passive houses to a higher degree than in the more conventional buildings, especially related to cooking and other heat-generating activities, which is normal in a more well insulated and airtight building.

SO RAIRO-OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Strategies such as price, CSR, and service have an important impact on enterprises and supply chains. This paper proposes a two-echelon dual-channel supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Considering the product pricing, CSR level, and service level in the supply chain, this paper employs the Stackelberg game to depict supply chain participants' optimal decisions and analyze the influence of explanatory variables on the optimal decision with retailer's payment methods. The results state that market share, service level, CSR, and financing interest rate significantly impact the pricing decision of all participants in the supply chain. In addition, strategies of CSR level and service level are also affected by the discount rate of advance payment, financing interest rate, return on investment, and opportunity cost rate. This paper incorporates CSR and service level into the objective function, considers a variety of retailers' payment methods, enriches the supply chain's pricing model, and is of great value to scientific decision-making of enterprises and sustainable development of supply chains.

TI Green Co-Creation Strategies among Supply Chain Partners: A Value
   Co-Creation Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In response to the global fight against environmental deterioration and resource shortage, many governments call on firms to implement green innovation strategies. However, for most small and medium-sized firms, the high cost of green innovation makes it difficult to achieve green goals, causing the need for a growing number of firms to cooperate with their supply chain partners on green innovations. Thus, this study explores, from a value co-creation perspective, how supply chain partners share the investment in, and benefits of, green innovation, assuring their long-term cooperation. Based on a three-level manufacturing supply chain, this paper proposes three different types of green co-creation strategies (i.e., the manufacturer and its supplier, the manufacturer and its competitor, the manufacturer and its retailer). We set the mechanism of co-creation to share the cost of green investment and consider the impact of co-creation on the sales of supply chain partners. Then, by constructing the value functions of three co-creation strategies and proving the concavity of these functions, the findings indicate that different co-creation strategies can indeed improve the firm's profit in a certain range and achieve a different maximum value in a certain green investment sharing point. This study enriches the literature on green co-creation in supply chains by combing green investment sharing strategies among supply chain partners with value co-creation. In addition, this study provides manufacturers with guidelines on how to share green costs and choose a green co-creation strategy in different operational environments.

TI Middlemen: good for resources and fishermen?
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB This paper studies the role of middlemen in open-access fisheries and how the organization of the supply chains affects resource exploitation and the level and distribution of economic rent. Imperfect competition among middlemen can help ensure that fish stocks are not depleted, which is typically the case in open-access fisheries with competitive markets. Middlemen with market power can also induce higher economic rent for the supply chain in total, but these rents mainly benefit the middlemen. The supply chains of inshore anchovy and offshore skipjack tuna fisheries in Vietnam are used as empirical examples. The analysis shows that in the anchovy supply chain, the middlemen have insignificant market power and the stock is being overexploited. In the skipjack tuna supply chain, the middlemen have oligopsony power and the stock is higher than the level that produces maximum sustainable yield.

TI The Economic Feasibility of Passive Houses in Korea
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The number of passive houses and zero-energy buildings being developed is increasing, as measures to reduce the rapidly increasing building energy consumption. While government building policies focus on energy savings, investors and the building market emphasize the initial investment cost. These conflicting perspectives obstruct the development of passive houses in the building market. In this study, a series of building energy analyses, including the effect of energy saving measures and economic information considering long-term economic benefit and incentives policy, will be presented. Analyses were performed on the energy-saving measures needed to improve the performance of single-family houses in Korea to that of the passive house standard, as well as the energy saving effect and increased cost. The application of energy saving measures for passive house implementation resulted in an additional cost of 1.85-4.20% compared to the conventional reference house. In addition, the proposed passive house alternative shows a short payback period and life cycle cost (LCC) result, compared to a conventional building's life cycle period. The possibility of passive house implementation is high, and developing the passive house is affordable for the investor or end user in Korea.

As a multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem, choosing a strategic green supplier is important to renewable supply chains. However, how to choose a strategic green supplier for supply chains is a great effort. Hence, In the present work, evaluating a set of strategic suppliers is primarily based on green capabilities by using an integrated fuzzy Best Worst Method (FBWM) with the other two techniques, namely COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives) and WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment). Initially, nine strategic supplier selection criteria have been identified through literature review and a real-world case study of Iran's renewable energy supply chain is deliberated to exhibit the proposed framework's applicability. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to decisionmakers of strategic supplier selection. It may aid decision-makers and the procurement department in differentiating the significant strategic green supplier selection criteria and assess the strategic green supplier in the local and global market supply chain. Finally, the strengths and limitation of the framework are discussed by using comparative analysis with other methods.

AB The influence of ethics in business has been widely researched for decades, albeit from an end-consumer perspective. This research employs a systematic review of literature and a case study methodology to analyse the influence of ethical business on supply chain relationships within the fresh organic produce industry in the state of Victoria, Australia. By exploring the different ethical antecedents of inter organizational trust within supply chain relationships, such as purchase characteristics, reputation, ethos and fairness, the paper demonstrates the impact of responsibility in supply chain relationships. The conceptual framework was validated by examining four case studies of small retail organizations in the organic fresh produce supply chain in Australia. This research contributes to existing literature by elucidating the influence of ethics in all facets of supply chain relationship management.

AB Production and transportation processes along a supply chain are dynamic In particular they are subject to perturbations (e.g. breakdown of a resource) that can destabilise the network. Stability is a major property of a supply chain that is essential for a sustainable relationship to its customers. In order to verify the stability of a given supply chain different criteria have been developed. This paper addresses the problem of choosing a proper mathematical modelling approach for a real world network in order to investigate stability. For this reason we discuss four different modelling approaches. Each of these approaches can model different characteristics of a supply chain and features a specific stability criterion. By comparing these approaches the paper supports choosing a proper modelling approach for a real world supply chain.

SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB With attempts being made by both governments and organizations to reduce environmental hazards, blockchain technology is becoming a crucial tool for attaining supply chain sustainability in small and medium enterprises (SME). Recognizing this fact, this study investigates the effect of blockchain technology on sustainable supply chain practices to improve organizational performance. In this investigation, data was gathered from 364 respondents, including middle and upper-level managers from SME manufacturing companies in China and Pakistan. The relationships among the endogenous and exogenous variables were tested by employing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The primary results suggest that blockchain technology and green information systems positively influence sustainable supply chain practices. Moreover, green information systems and sustainable supply chain practices possess a significant positive association. Sustainable supply chain practices have a positive and significant relationship with sustainability; i.e., operational, environmental, and economic performance. The findings also reveal that three dimensions of organizational sustainability-i.e., operational, environmental, and economic performance-have a significant effect on organizational performance. Additionally, the results of this study provide valuable insights into blockchain technology and offer policy implications for manufacturers and legislators regarding the implementation and promotion of green supply chain practices.

TI Virtual organization for supply chain integration: Two cases in the
   textile and fashion retailing industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB A supply chain is an alternative form with competitive entity consisting of a group of companies in the business environment. Some supply chain projects are initiated by associated firms while some are started by the head office of multinational enterprises in order to integrate the diversified subordinates. This study focuses on the investigation on the supply chain structures within the boundaries of two multinational textile enterprises, respectively. One enterprise tries to integrate the market side by merging a brand owner. The other seeks an integration solution to compensate from its loss of control of sub-manufacturing sites which during corporate expansion were registered as independent firms. Both enterprises have initiated their global logistics management projects in order to balance the demand and supply. By participating in the two projects, our research indicates the different barriers of integrating toward the upstream and downstream supply chains and provides a mutual solution by building up the e-Fashion global supply chains. Similarities and dissimilarities of both cases towards the virtual organization approach are also addressed in this paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Supply Chain Transparency as a Consumer or Corporate Tool: The Case of
   Nudie Jeans Co
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY
AB Outsourcing has led both to the embedding of questionable sustainability practices in opaque supply chains and to anti-sweatshop challenges demanding more transparent supply chains. Previous research has argued that supply chain transparency can be both a consumer tool empowering consumers to pressure disclosing firms to improve sustainability conditions and a corporate tool for increasing revenues. Based on a study of the transparency project of Swedish company Nudie Jeans, the authors demonstrate that consumers do not leverage transparency but that transparency improves consumer willingness to buy. In doing this, the authors contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, the authors provide one of the first, if not the first, studies of whether consumers in practice leverage increased supply chain transparency, challenging the previous research claim that supply chain transparency is a useful consumer tool. Second, the authors move beyond studies of purchasing intentions and willingness to buy in experimental settings and confirm that supply chain transparency is a useful corporate tool in practice. The authors conclude by discussing the policy implications of companies being able to use transparency to increase sales without subjecting themselves to increased consumer pressure.

SO INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB This study analyzed the applicability of the Passive House standard to office buildings in northern China from an indoor environment perspective. The case building has been auto-monitored continuously since 2017 and a survey for instantaneous and retrospective appraisal of indoor environmental conditions was administered in 2021 during the summer, winter and months in between, referred to as 'transition months'. The results show that indoor environment quality was good, with high satisfaction levels and ultra-low energy consumption; overheating and the need for window opening were observed. The prevalence of sick building syndrome was reduced compared to conventional buildings. This work further determined how comfort parameters such as perceived thermal comfort, indoor air quality and acoustics could affect end-users' appraisal. Findings show that indoor thermal comfort design parameters, particularly in summer, are critical factors affecting users' satisfaction in Passive Houses. We further examined the feasibility of the PMV-PPD index for predicting occupants' perceived comfort and suggested deriving the preferred thermal comfort design parameters for the Chinese market, using long-term data and measurements. These findings provide insights into the localization of Passive Houses in China, thereby improving the acceptance of Passive Houses in what is expected to be a fast growing market.

TI Analysis of supply chain complexity drivers for Indian mining equipment
   manufacturing companies combining SAP-LAP and AHP
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB In today's world supply chain has become more complex due to the multiplicity of drivers created by globalization, global geopolitical risk, technological disruption, market uncertainty, mass-customization and changing laws and regulations. Supply Chain Complexity (SCC) is one of the most difficult problems in today's global supply chains and assumed as the key impediment to business performance. SCC has the significant adverse impact on competitiveness, cost efficiency, customer satisfaction, product innovation and market share. It is imperative for the focal firm and its supply chain managers to know SCC drivers causing supply chain complexity. Identification and prioritizing of SCC drivers are required for effective monitoring and controlling of supply chain management. SCC drivers can be categorized based on the origin of their generation as upstream, operational, downstream and external. This paper presents the study conducted in leading earthmoving and mining equipment manufacturing firms in India, to understand the supply chain complexities for off-road & mining equipment industries. Qualitative situation-actors-process (SAP) and learning-action-performance (LAP) model has been applied to understand and analyze the concept of supply chain complexity drivers and its dynamic behavior. Quantitatively multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) is used in prioritizing SCC drivers due to the subjectivity of drivers. An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) study has also been done to quantify and prioritize SCC drivers for managerial decision making. This study contributes towards developing a priority ranking of SCC drivers based on its impact on overall SCC which have significant importance in supply chain strategic planning. The current research investigates evolving SCC drivers like supplier resourcing risk, supplier competence, regional strategies, shortening product life-cycle, changing customer service expectation which were not adequately addressed in existing literature. Our research findings provides practical insights to managers in understanding the role of SCC drivers like market uncertainty and risk, changing laws and regulations, constant change in customer requirement, multiplicity of customers, forecast inaccuracy, sustainable supply chain practices in the overall outcome of ranking. The outcome of this study also enriches the existing literature of SCC with practitioners' insight from manufacturing industry.

TI Sustainable Decision-Making in a Low-Carbon Supply Chain: Fairness
   Preferences and Green Investment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study investigates optimal decisions in a low-carbon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a leading retailer considering the green investment and fairness preferences of member firms. Four Stackelberg game decision models are constructed, in which the manufacturer and the retailer engage in green investment separately when the manufacturer has and does not have fairness preferences. The impacts of fairness preferences and green investment on the optimal decision in the low-carbon supply chain are comparatively analysed. The results show that member firms engage in green investment regardless of the presence or absence of fairness preferences and that this behaviour increases the wholesale price, retail price, and market demand of low-carbon products as well as the profits of member firms and the supply chain. A more interesting finding is that the profit growth of member firms and the supply chain due to the manufacturer's green manufacturing practices is more pronounced than that due to the retailer's green marketing practices. When the retailer and the manufacturer engage in green investment, the manufacturer's fairness preferences have different effects on the wholesale price, retail price, market demand, level of green marketing efforts, member enterprises and profits of the supply chain. Therefore, firms should consider the impact of green investment and fairness preferences when making pricing and performance decisions to achieve efficient operation of the whole supply chain and prevent double marginal effects. Finally, the above conclusions are verified through numerical simulation, providing a reference for the decision-making of member firms in a low-carbon supply chain.

TI Modelling the drivers of responsiveness of automotive supply chain using
   an integrated fuzzy DEMATEL-ISM approach
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB Purpose The automotive industry appears to overcome much of its obstacles, despite the constant struggle facing COVID-19. The pandemic has resulted in significant improvements in the habits and conduct of consumers. There is an increased preference for personal mobility. In this dynamic environment with unexpected changes and high market rivalry, automotive supply chains focus more on executing responsive strategies with minimum costs. This paper aims to identify and model the drivers to the responsiveness of automotive supply chain. Design/methodology/approach Seventeen drivers for supply chain responsiveness have been identified from the extensive literature, expert interview. An integrated methodology of fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-interpretive structural modelling (DEMATEL-ISM) is developed to establish the interrelationship between the drivers. The cause-effect relationship between the drivers was obtained through fuzzy DEMATEL technique, and a hierarchical structure of the drivers was developed using the ISM technique. Findings The result of the integrated methodology revealed that strategic decision-making of management, accurate forecasting of demand, advanced manufacturing system in the organisation and data integration tools are the critical drivers. Research limitations/implications This study has conceptual and analytical limitations. In this study, a limited number of drivers are examined for supply chain responsiveness. Further research may examine the role of other key performance indicators in the broad field of responsiveness in the automotive supply chain or other industry sectors. Future study can uncover the interrelationships and relative relevance of indicators using advanced multi-criteria decision-making methodologies. Originality/value The authors proposed an integrated methodology that will be benefitted to the supply chain practitioners and automotive manufacturers to develop management strategies to improve responsiveness. This study further helps to compare the responsiveness of the supply chain between various automotive manufacturers.

TI Passive House at the crossroads: The past and the present of a voluntary
   standard that managed to bridge the energy efficiency gap
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Improving energy efficiency in dwellings is generally seen as the low-hanging fruit of climate change mitigation. In particular decreased heat loss through better insulation is suggested as one of the most cost-effective means to achieve the ambitious national and international goals of climate gas reduction. However, the literature shows that a profitable technological solution is not sufficient to reach the energy goals. Aspects such as a lack of information, unobserved costs, and heterogeneity among users can compromise the success of technical innovation. Still, there are successful concepts that drive the technological development in the construction sector. The Passive House is an example for such innovations that manage to bridge the energy efficiency gap. This paper addresses the Passive House concept and standard as a success story of technological innovation. With Bruno Latour's Science in Action (1987) as a starting point, we describe the conditions under which the standard was created, the role of the network built around the Passive House Institute, and the consequences of exporting the standard. We identify success factors that have supported the diffusion of the Passive House standard and concept and discuss its possible development in the current situation which is characterized by its wide-spread adoption.

TI A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature on Food Industry Supply Chain
   Resilience: Investigating Key Contributors and Global Trends
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Purpose: In light of ongoing challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and globalization, it is critical to have resilient food industry supply chains that can operate effectively in uncertain conditions. This study aims to contribute to this effort by investigating current trends and developments in the area of food industry supply chain resilience and identifying potential areas for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 122 articles published between 2008 and 2023, utilizing multiple quantitative measures such as bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Findings: Our study identifies five distinct clusters of research on food industry supply chain resilience. We found that food systems resilience and public health is the most extensively studied aspect, indicating the importance of ensuring that our food supply chains are capable of withstanding disruptions to maintain public health. The other four clusters-seafood supply chain resilience and risk management; digital and sustainable food systems; agri-food Industry 4.0 and sustainability; and meat production and the food industry-each represent important areas for future research and development. Originality: To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a bibliometric approach to analyze the resilience of food supply chain systems. By doing so, we provide a unique and original contribution to the existing literature on food supply chain systems, as prior bibliometric analyses have not specifically focused on the resilience aspect. Practical implications: Our findings highlight the need for continued research and development in the area of food industry supply chain resilience. By identifying the most pressing areas for improvement and future research, our study can help inform policy decisions and guide industry efforts to create more resilient food supply chains that can adapt to changing conditions.

TI Mixed-income green housing in St George, Staten Island
SO LOCAL ECONOMY
AB This proposal sets out to find which policy measure pertaining to affordable housing would be most successful in revitalizing the St George neighborhood on Staten Island. St George has dealt with issues such as a lagging commercial district, difficulty drawing people to the neighborhood, homelessness, and a stagnant housing market. The emergence of affordable green housing units, mixed-income housing developments, and community-based initiatives focused on urban neighborhoods have become increasingly successful pieces in economic and infrastructural development throughout major urban areas. This paper will use scholarly research focusing on the role sustainably built affordable housing, mixed-income housing units, and community-based housing initiatives have in revitalizing urban neighborhoods. Findings from this study reveal that the introduction of mixed-income green housing units in urban areas can be successful in raising the socioeconomic standard of living within designated neighborhoods. It is suggested that a community-based housing initiative be established to introduce affordable mixed-income green housing units to the St George neighborhood of Staten Island.

TI Water Footprints and Virtual Water Flows Embodied in the Power Supply
   Chain
SO WATER
AB Water use within power supply chains has been frequently investigated. A unified framework to quantify the water use of power supply chains deserves more development. This article provides an overview of the water footprint and virtual water incorporated into power supply chains. A water-use mapping model of the power supply chain is proposed in order to map the analysed research works according to the considered aspects. The distribution of water footprint per power generation technology per region is illustrated, in which Asia is characterised by the largest variation of the water footprint in hydro-, solar, and wind power. A broader consensus on the system boundary for the water footprint evaluation is needed. The review also concludes that the water footprint of power estimated by a top-down approach is usually higher and more accurate. A consistent virtual water accounting framework for power supply chains is still lacking. Water scarcity risks could increase through domestic and global power trade. This review provides policymakers with insights on integrating water and energy resources in order to achieve sustainable development for power supply chains. For future work, it is essential to identify the responsibilities of both the supply and demand sides to alleviate the water stress.

TI Circular Economy indicators for supply chains: A systematic literature
   review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB Recently, the Circular Economy paradigm has emerged as an alternative to linear and unsustainable production and consumption systems. However, no established indicator exists to assist the transition of supply chains to a higher degree of circularity; also, most of the literature on Circular Economy indicators has focused on the firm rather than on the supply chain as the level of analysis. Through a Systematic Literature Review, this paper examines decision support tools, and related indicators, employed for assessing the performance of Circular Supply Chains in the academic literature. In parallel, a content analysis and a template technique are employed to evaluate how Multi National Enterprises measure the effect of the adoption of Circular Economy practices in their reports. Results are synthesised in two composite indicators, which aggregate the most commonly employed metrics. Findings show that both academic literature and industrial practice show a scarce consideration of social and circularity measurements, rather focusing on classical environmental impacts and economic ones. In the academic literature, the economic dimension is prevalent; practitioners seem to evaluate and communicate more often the environmental impacts of already adopted Circular Economy practices. This article also recognises the different and sometimes hidden worldview assumptions in current Circular Economy indicators, highlighting that different paths toward Circular Supply Chains are possible depending on value and methodological choices. Future contributions should explicetly state these assumptions and their idea of a Circular Economy.

TI Sustainable Digitalization in Pharmaceutical Supply Chains Using Theory
   of Constraints: A Qualitative Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable digitalized supply chain management in a pharmaceutical company can help reduce operation costs, improve assets, enhance shareholders' value, positively respond to customer demand, and generate profits. Guided by the theory of constraints, this qualitative multiple-case study aimed to explore strategies pharmaceutical managers use to digitalize integrated supply chain systems to increase sustainability and profitability. The participants were senior supply chain managers from various pharmaceutical companies in the US with strategies to digitalize their integrated supply chain systems. Data collection included semistructured interviews and publicly available company documents analysis. Data were analyzed using the six-step thematic process, and three themes emerged: (a) constraints in the current supply chain system, (b) digital technology enablers, and (c) sustainable, resilient, and agile supply chain systems. A system model was developed as an outcome of the research. The primary recommendation for pharmaceutical supply chain managers is to identify constraints in the current supply chain system, follow a digital road map using digital enablers and maintain a sustainable, resilient, and agile supply chain system. Implications for positive social change include the potential to improve the delivery and quality of pharmaceutical products needed for patients by not compromising environmental, social, and economic sustainability.

TI Developing Fair Investment Plans to Enhance Supply Chain Visibility
   Using Cooperative Games
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As supply chains become more complex and globalized, the individual participants of the supply chains should invest in systems based on information communication technologies (ICT) such as the remote frequency identification device (RFID) with tags that secure the visibility of the entire supply chain. In addition, the level of visibility, such as the container, pallet, carton, and box, should be determined for each participant to optimize its own profit function. By using a collaborative game scheme, the present study illustrates the relationships among participants who invest to a certain level of visibility, and then how much value each participant gets. To find feasible solutions, a genetic algorithm-based mechanism is devised for modeling various fitness functions considering the total profit and benefit to cost (B/C) ratio. The proposed framework considers the relationship among participants, as well as the impact from the enhanced visibility, and it may be possible to make fair and rational decisions for all participants based on the quantitative metrics such as the B/C ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the game-theoretic approach where the enhanced visibility prevents a certain participant from taking most of the benefit. It seems possible to establish a long-term sustainable supply chain visibility by distributing profit fairly to all participants in the supply chain.

TI A Collaborative Cloud Service Platform for Realizing Sustainable
   Make-To-Order Apparel Supply Chain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As fashion mass customization has been developing rapidly in the recent decade, supply chain in apparel industry was required to be more flexible for meeting the need of quick response toward the dynamic changes in the fashion market. Forecast-based make-to-stock production strategy was not suitable anymore. Make-to-order strategy was employed by more and more apparel companies. However, there were still many defects in traditional make-to-order apparel supply chain, e.g., sustainability is still at a low level. In this study, we proposed a collaborative cloud service platform to develop a novel model of sustainable make-to-order apparel supply chain. A service provider selection heuristic was designed for this platform to optimally select suppliers corresponding to each received demand. Multi-agent-based simulation technology was utilized to build the proposed platform and to evaluate the new sustainable supply chain model. Experiment was conducted in the simulation to compare our new model to traditional apparel make-to-order model and model with outsourcing mechanism. Based on simulation results, the remarkable improvement in terms of sustainability of the proposed platform and corresponding supply chain model was demonstrated.

TI Redesigning the Municipal Solid Waste Supply Chain Considering the
   Classified Collection and Disposal: A Case Study of Incinerable Waste in
   Beijing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The output of municipal solid waste is growing rapidly, which has brought tremendous pressure to urban development. The supply chain of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China mainly contains three processes: collection, transportation, and disposal. The waste is sorted at the collection and disposed of according to the classification. However, it is mixed at the transportation stage. Mixed transportation remixes the separately collected waste, which seriously affects the disposal effect. The supply chain of MSW urgently needs to be redesigned to improve the MSW disposal effect. First of all, on the ground of the waste treatment situation, we redesigned the supply chain of MSW in China. Secondly, combined with the redesign of the MSW supply chain, this paper established the function allocation model for collection stations, making a collection station only gather one type of waste, and built the transportation path planning model for vehicles, reducing the impact of waste storage on residents. Finally, based on the data of Xuanwu District in Beijing, the supply chain redesigning practical example of incinerable waste was given. The supply chain redesigning model in this paper not only makes full use of the existing infrastructure but also improves the disposal effect of waste. The supply chain redesigning model has practical application value.

TI Multiple network embedding, green knowledge integration and green supply
   chain performance-Investigation based on agglomeration scenario
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The performance of a green supply chain shows particularity and complexity due to its multiple network features. This study aiming at digging out the logical relationship between network embedding and green supply chain performance in the context of agglomeration scenarios. In this study, taking Chinese eco-industrial park as the sample, the logic and mechanism of multiple network embedding on the performance of the green supply chain under the agglomeration scenario are empirically investigated by mediation and moderation as well as simulation method. As a result, the three dimensions of network embedding: relationship embedding, structure embedding and knowledge embedding, all significantly promote the integration of green knowledge, and green knowledge integration plays a mediating effect between multiple network embedding and green supply chain performance. As a whole, the agglomeration scenario plays a positive moderation role in logic chain of "multiple network embedding-knowledge integration-green performance" in green supply chain; to be specific, the economic performance of the green supply chain shows a trend of first improving and then stabilizing, while the environmental performance shows a "U" pattern. In conclusion, it is crucial to embed platform for knowledge integration and interaction into the industrial agglomeration and explore cooperation network of the green supply chain. By integrating the internal and external knowledge resources of the agglomeration through multiple network embedding, we can effectively and efficiently realize sustainable development and cleaner production in a green supply chain.

TI Creating integrated business and environmental value within the context
   of China's circular economy and ecological modernization
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper investigates the challenges and opportunities of how firms and organizations can and will be able to strike a better balance between economic growth and environmental stewardship in the context of China's emerging 'circular economy' policy paradigm and based on ecological modernization theoretic approaches.
   Based on three company case studies in the information technology and electronic industries in China, we identify and demonstrate how a blended business and environmental value can be created from adopting a sustainable supply chain management approach. The adoption of a sustainable supply chain management approach is rapidly becoming a key business challenge and opportunity in China and other large emerging economies around the world, where our greatest environmental management challenges currently reside and will continue to exist for many years to come. The value creation framework proposed in research focuses on evaluating three case study companies who appear in various stages of an electronic industry supply chain. Value creation within a supply chain can provide the impetus for organizations to adopt circular economy, sustainable supply chain practices, for competitive reasons.
   In addition, we describe how a value proposition can be evaluated at two levels of analysis, a more specific micro-level and a more general meso-level of analysis. The four major business value dimensions include cost reduction, revenue generation, resiliency, and legitimacy and image.
   The initial findings are that a variety of opportunities exist for electronic firms in emerging and developing countries, while results from this study provide an important scholarly foundation to develop and refine sustainable supply chain management practices in emerging and developing economies.

AB Suppliers are a potential source of innovation through knowledge sharing and creation. By making full use of knowledge sharing and creation organizations can generate sustainable advantage through innovation. This research studies the role of procurement management in enabling innovation throughout the supply chain, identifying best knowledge practices and possibilities. The primary question asks: What knowledge based practices successfully facilitate innovation in supply chains. The secondary question asks: Are there regional differences in the use of these knowledge based practices between Europe, North America and Asia? This research addresses the use of knowledge based practices to successfully facilitate innovation from in the supply chain, identifying and capturing these practices, and investigates regional differences in the use of these knowledge based practices. The overlap between knowledge processes facilitating knowledge sharing and knowledge based practices enabling innovation is also explored. The importance of knowledge based innovation on cost optimization (research shows businesses spend two thirds of revenue on non-labour costs), risk management (floods, tsunamis and horsemeat scandals have all recently demonstrated supply chain risk), and new product and service offerings development to the organization, are also explored. This study is important to any organization that has a need to acquire goods and services, or outsources operations. It is important for those involved in procurement and supply chain management to have insights into the knowledge based practices that help an organization share and create knowledge with suppliers that can generate value both for the organization, its suppliers and customers.

TI Supply chain management and environmental technologies: the role of
   integration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB As corporations attempt to move toward environmental sustainability, management must extend their efforts to improve environmental practices across their supply chain. To date, the literature characterising environmental management within the supply chain has been slowly building, but remains sparse. Moreover, investment by plants in environmental technologies cannot be made independently of other organisations in the supply chain. The linkage between supply chain characteristics, such as the degree of integration with primary suppliers and major customers, and the resources invested in different environmental technologies is assessed with plant-level survey data. The results indicate that resources were increasingly allocated toward pollution prevention when plants developed extensive strategic-level integration with suppliers, including such aspects as product development and knowledge sharing. However, these effects were not mirrored with customers. Instead, greater supply chain integration with customers was significantly related to pollution control. Collectively, these findings suggested that downstream supply chain members tend to favour prevention while simultaneously shifting the burden for control to upstream members.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This research explores the mediating effects of product returns on the relationship between a firm's green capabilities and its adoption of closed-loop supply chain. Green capability is characterized in terms of product recovery, supply chain integration, and environmentally friendly manufacturing. A structural equation model using survey data drawn from ISO 14001 certified manufacturers in Malaysia is used to test the research hypotheses. The results reveal that recovery and integration capabilities positively influence product returns, while manufacturing and integration capabilities and product returns influence closed loop supply chain adoption. The results also indicate that the volume, type, timing, and quality of product returns partially mediate relationships between recovery and integration capabilities and closed-loop supply chain adoption. The findings highlight the importance of taking into account the complexities of product returns as part of efforts to increase the effects of green capabilities on closed-loop supply chain adoption.

TI Social Preferences and Supply Chain Performance: An Experimental Study
SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB Supply chain contracting literature has traditionally focused on aligning incentives for economically rational players. Recent work has hypothesized that social preferences, as distinct from economic incentives, may influence behavior in supply chain transactions. Social preferences refer to intrinsic concerns for the other party's welfare, reciprocating a history of a positive relationship, and intrinsic desires for a higher relative payoff compared with the other party's when status is salient. This article provides experimental evidence that social preferences systematically affect economic decision making in supply chain transactions. Specifically, supply chain parties deviate from the predictions provided by self-interested profit-maximization models, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation, individual performance, and high system efficiency, sustainable over time; whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both system efficiency and individual performance.

TI Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Sustainable Supply Chain Financing
   Decision Based on Triple Bottom Line Theory
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, sustainable supply chains that balance economic development and the environment have become an inevitable focus for many businesses and industries. Supply chain finance as the core driving force for supply chain development, plays a vital role in resolving any financing difficulties that exist in many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the upstream and downstream of the supply chain. However, most SME supply chain financing assessments currently use economic indicators as the sole measure of the evaluation system and rarely consider sustainability. While existing supply chain financing decision-making systems can resolve SME financing problems to some extent, the one-sided pursuit of maximum economic benefits is contrary to sustainable development and does not assist financial institutions in avoiding finance risks. Therefore, this paper, based on the theory of the triple bottom line (economy, environment, and society) from a sustainable development perspective, innovatively proposes an SME financing evaluation model for supply chain finance that applies a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method combined with Topsis. Additionally, at the end, an example is given to demonstrate model validity and evaluate the best possible SME financing model for financial institutions.

AB To ensure the continuity of their activities, companies implement supply chain risk management (SCRM) approaches to reduce their vulnerability towards risks and secure their supply chain. However, implementing SCRM approaches and the effectiveness of risk mitigation depends greatly on the types of risks considered. In this paper, we focus on a specific source of risk linked to critical materials, i.e., the availability and accessibility of raw materials in relation to geopolitical, economic, environmental and/or technical contexts. Critical materials are a significant source of vulnerability for supply chains, and their identification via criticality assessment methodologies is a topic of growing concern. Based on a literature review, we elaborate a conceptual model integrating material criticality assessment into SCRM. This model can be considered as the first step in building a global framework positioning critical materials as a key factor for supply chain risk management.

TI The role of capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility
   and enhancing circular economy-target performance: an empirical study
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose A circular economy is a popular approach considered by many firms to address sustainable development goals strategically. Literature indicates that collaborative relationships among supply chain partners facilitate circular economy practices. However, there is a dearth of studies in lower-middle-income countries indicating the unique challenges industries face whilst practising circular economy principles and how the challenges can be overcome. To address the calls of previous researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships: engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular economy-target performance. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760 employees of Indian firms. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to perform the path analysis to determine a firm's capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and enhancing circular economy target performance. Findings Drawing upon dynamic capability theory, it was first established that engagement capability has a positive and significant influence on alliance capability, whilst data analytics capability played a partial mediating role. Second, it was established that alliance capability and data analytics capability significantly affect sustainable supply chain flexibility, whilst industry dynamism played a moderating role. Finally, it was clear that sustainable supply chain flexibility had a significant and positive effect on circular economy target performance, ultimately enhancing sustainability. Originality/value This study advances the circular economy literature by recommending that firms must consider some critical operational level capabilities to develop their dynamic capability, i.e. sustainable supply chain flexibility, to better meet the competitive market conditions in turbulent business environments.

AB Electric vehicles are important technologies to reduce adverse environmental impacts stemming from transportation. In this paper, we investigated the environmental, social, and economic impacts of electric vehicles in Qatar, where the electricity generation is currently 100% natural gas. As electric vehicles is expected replace the internal combustion engine vehicles and each vehicle type has different supply chain for the fuel, the sustainability impacts in the upstream of fuel supply-chain can be significantly different. Hence, a supply-chain based approach is developed to capture impact shift from petroleum sector to electricity generation sector in the supply chain of electricity and petroleum. Results revealed that electric vehicles can save up to 28% of life cycle cost, 71% of Greenhouse gas emissions, 51% of photochemical oxidant formation, and 63% of human health impacts.

AB The interest in desalination has been growing steadily for the recent decades due to the increased demand for fresh water worldwide. The expansion of global population, increasing water demand, along with recent climate changes and scarceness of natural water sources, have caused the increment of desalination plants' establishment globally Viewing the desalination network as a supply chain allows decision makers to evaluate the performance of desalination processes end to end. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop key performance measures to evaluate the efficiency of water desalination supply chain. Different desalination supply chain performance measures have been reviewed and distributed into economic, social, operational and environmental perspective. The performance measures and metrics have been further refined by a panel of experts using Delphi technique. The performance measurement framework is validated through in-depth interviews with two companies operating in Saudi's water desalination supply chain. The collected data were analyzed, interpreted, and a weight factor has been assigned to each criterion and sub-criteria based on its significant in desalination supply chain using analysis hierarchy process method. This research benefits both academics and decision makers through developing a holistic performance framework for water desalination supply chain.

In this paper we strive to study at the concept of "passive house" in the Romania. Using the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software 2007, we calculate the heating requirements for such a House, depending on the latitude and climate conditions in the locality. For the study were selected a city from Romania placed to 47,47 latitude and 22,52 longitude. To determine the possibility of implementing the concept of the "passive House" must be determined: required heating, cooling demand and primary energy demand. In order to implement this concept should not exceed maximum limits.

TI Project Implementation Constraints with Examples from Affordable Housing
   and Infrastructure Efforts
SO CASES ON THE DIFFUSION AND ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
AB Comprehensive approaches to sustainable, affordable housing and infrastructure development often prove challenging in developing countries. Several ideas for low cost housing and infrastructure in urban Sub-Saharan Africa appear to have nearly perfect technical characteristics responding to current urban planning and development experience, but yet the project execution of these concepts reveals significant shortcomings. Additionally, the long-term effects of a project often have unintended side effects, and still, similar projects continue to be repeated. To consider these numerous aspects simultaneously is crucial for success. This chapter details three projects with potentially successful concepts for sustainable infrastructure, but which did not succeed fully due to the project framework and imperfections therein. Described are responses to common problems in Sub-Saharan Africa from Rwanda and Malawi in low cost housing, domestic infrastructure, and communal, decentral infrastructure, respectively. Besides describing their realistic solutions and their integration of environmental and social concerns, and despite being based on the principle of multi-level networking and support, the chapter goes beyond the technical description to analyze shortcomings and constraints of implementation. For the discussion of success factors when implementing a project, two additional best practice examples are used.

AB There is a need to understand food supply chain management (FSCM) with the help of a process-oriented comprehensive definition and consider complex tasks involved therein. The study identifies FSCM and supply chain management's basic definitions and focuses on a systematic literature review. None of the identified previously proposed definitions of FSCM has comprehensively covered all the significant operational issues in FSCM. Thus, the study further undertook the mapping of identified definitions with six key focusses in FSCM identified through the literature survey. This study systematically proposes a comprehensive definition of FSCM. Findings suggested that "Quality management" includes safety and traceability of the food product and "Sustainable Management," including proper waste management as the most critical focus in FSCM. This study proposes a comprehensive FSCM definition comprising key managerial that focuses on the food supply chain (FSC). The literature survey is done with 160 selected papers and has subjectivity in mapping and analysis. This definition seems essential for theory building, as none of the available definitions has included all the dominant characteristics of FSCM. A comprehensive definition of FSCM would act as a reference point for supply chain-based research on the food sector.

TI Measuring congestion in sustainable supply chain based on data
   envelopment analysis
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) involves the integrating of environmental, social and economic concerns into supply chain management activities with emphasis on the managers' efforts in the context of reducing the negative social and environmental impacts. Evaluating sustainable supply chain performance and efficiency is a significant topic for many researchers and scholars. Presence of input and intermediate product congestion is one of the key issues that results in lower efficiency and performance in a sustainable supply chain. Therefore, determination of congestion is of prime importance and removing it improves performance of the sustainable supply chain. One of the most appropriate methods for detecting congestion is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Some studies have been conducted to detect the intermediate product congestion via solving Network DEA (NDEA) models without considering the role of intermediate products. In this study, a sustainable supply chain with two-stage structure was considered. Then, the congestion status according to the role of intermediate products was found out for the first time. Towards this aim, different scenarios which congestion can occur in intermediate products were identified. Then, in each scenario, the dominant cone definition was developed in network structure and NDEA models were proposed. Finally 20 Iranian sustainable supply chains of Resin manufacturing companies have been used to demonstrate applicability of the proposed models.

TI Evaluation of Humanitarian Supply Chain Resilience in Flood Disaster
SO WATER
AB Frequent natural hazards such as flooding and the devastating consequences of severe events make the humanitarian supply chain particularly important in alleviating the suffering of those communities impacted by such events. However, the ambiguity of information and the different goals of stakeholders demand that the humanitarian supply chain must be resilient. This research adopts the use of literature review and expert opinions to identify the indicators that affect the resilience of the humanitarian supply chain using the flood event in Hechuan District, China in 2020 as an example. Based on the combination of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and formulate forward-looking strategic plans. At the same time, these key decision makers should also be aware of the need to adjust their strategies at different stages of the flooding event in order to achieve a flexible humanitarian supply chain that responds to the varying demands over the course of a flooding event. The results of this study will help professionals involved in humanitarian supply chains to develop strategies and plans to become more resilient thus helping to reduce losses from natural hazards such as floods.

AB Today's globalized, leaner and just-in-time supply chains are more vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters. The business environment is continuously varying which produces risk and to manage this risk, it requires resilience. This paper proposes a new framework for supply chain resilience that leverages existing knowledge and offers a better understanding of the available notion in literature. It incorporates flexibility, adaptability, collaboration, visibility and sustainability as the major pillars for resilient supply chains. This framework provides a new means to evaluate 'supply chain fitness' and also provides critical insights for decision making by minimizing the negative impact of unavoidable risk events. Thus it incorporates event readiness and provides an efficient response.

TI Action Mechanism and Model of Cross-Border E-Commerce Green Supply Chain
   Based on Customer Behavior
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB In recent years, China's cross-border e-commerce has flourished, and the transaction volume has increased year by year. Cross-border e-commerce has become a favorable breakthrough point for China's foreign trade. This article mainly studies the action mechanism and model of cross-border e-commerce green supply chain based on customer behavior. Green supply chain partners select 24 secondary indicators of the evaluation system as the input vector. The historical data of each index is collected by field investigation as sample data and brought into the neural network for training. The output vector of the only output layer of the network is used as the evaluation result of the supplier. This paper divides the operation mode of green supply chain into four stages and puts forward improvement tools for the functional modules in each stage. Enterprises can use the tools in the modules to improve the operation efficiency of green supply chain. According to the green level evaluation demand of green supply chain, this paper uses the hierarchical method to evaluate it. According to the survey results, this paper uses arithmetic average method to deal with the operation and establishes a secondary index after decomposition. Finally, this paper uses confirmatory factor analysis to test the measurement model and further uses analysis of variance to test the relationship between the two types of social cues and behavioral willingness. The data shows that the orderly fluctuation range of the east, middle, and west cross-border logistics subsystems basically remains at around 0.2 to 0.6. The results show that the establishment of the green supply chain model has a very positive significance for the implementation and development of the green supply chain in China's manufacturing industry. Through the research of profit and profit distribution in the green supply chain, it provides guidance for the green supply chain to effectively select the supply chain members to cooperate and calculate and distribute the profit reasonably, so that the green supply chain management can be widely used in reality.

AB The article draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and global value chain (GVC) frameworks to analyse the drivers and trajectories of foreign private investment in biofuel production in Ghana. It is based on a narrative of the evolution of a niche for Jatropha production in Ghana in the period 1995-2016 including company case studies. The factors analysed relating to MLP are alignment of expectations, network formation, and learning and knowledge sharing, and those relating to GVC are chain structure, governance, ownership, and access to land and capital. High entry barriers for creating a new agriculture-based value chain for global biofuel markets, i.e. high volume requirements, high capital needs, and market risks contributed to the collapse of the jatropha sector in Ghana. A low level of learning and knowledge sharing between jatropha actors in Ghana, alongside weak public R & D support, reduced access to technical and managerial information. Confirming previous GVC research on bioffiels, policy and NGOs had a stronger influence on the jatropha value chain than in typical agricultural chains. Moreover, global drivers and the strategies and capabilities of foreign investors can strongly influence the development of a new biofuel value chain in a developing country. The latter points complement previous research on Jatropha, which highlights politico- economic factors such as land tenure, regional and local power relations, and the interests of donors and NGOs. The study exemplifies a non-evolutionary niche development that goes beyond the European experiences of industrial niche development on which the MLP framework was first established. The Importance of investors and policy at different levels of the value chain illustrate the synergies in combining the MLP and GVC frameworks in research on energy transitions in developing countries.

AB Recent growing interest in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires the application of effective energy solutions, such as the utilization of renewable resources. Biomass represents a promising renewable resource for bioenergy, since it has the potential to reduce GHG emissions from various industry sectors. In spite of the potential benefits, biomass is limited due to logistical challenges of collection and transport to bio-refineries. This study proposes a forest biomass-to-bio-oil mixed supply chain network to reduce the GHG emissions compared to a conventional bioenergy supply chain. The mixed supply chain includes mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation. Life cycle assessment is conducted for a case study in the Pacific Northwest with the assistance of available life cycle inventory data for biomass-to-bio-oil supply chain. Impact assessment, on a global warming potential (GWP) basis, is conducted with the assistance of databases within SimaPro 8 software. Sensitivity analysis for the case investigated indicates that using the mixed supply chain can reduce GHG emissions by 2-5% compared to the traditional supply chain.

TI Supply-chain uncertainty: a review and theoretical foundation for future
   research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Supply-chain uncertainty is an issue with which every practising manager wrestles, deriving from the increasing complexity of global supply networks. Taking a broad view of supply-chain uncertainty (incorporating supply-chain risk), this paper seeks to review the literature in this area and develop a theoretical foundation for future research. The literature review identifies a comprehensive list of 14 sources of uncertainty, including those that have received much research attention, such as the bullwhip effect, and those more recently described, such as parallel interaction. Approaches to managing these sources of uncertainty are classified into: 10 approaches that seek to reduce uncertainty at its source; and, 11 approaches that seek to cope with it, thereby minimising its impact on performance. Manufacturing strategy theory, including the concepts of alignment and contingency, is then used to develop a model of supply-chain uncertainty, which is populated using the literature review to show alignment between uncertainty sources and management strategies. Future research proposed includes more empirical research in order to further investigate: which uncertainties occur in particular industrial contexts; the impact of appropriate sources/management strategy alignment on performance; and the complex interplay between management strategies and multiple sources of uncertainty (positive or negative).

TI Antiretroviral procurement and supply chain management
SO ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
AB Procurement, the country-level process of ordering antiretrovirals (ARVs), and supply chain management, the mechanism by which they are delivered to healthcare facilities, are critical processes required to move ARVs from manufacturers to patients. To provide a glimpse into the ARV procurement and supply chain, the following pages provide an overview of the primary stakeholders, principal operating models, and policies and regulations involved in ARV procurement. Also presented are key challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that the supply chain is not a barrier to the goal of universal coverage. This article will cover the steps necessary to order and distribute ARVs, including different models of delivery, key stakeholders involved, strategic considerations that vary depending on context and policies affecting them. The single drug examples given illustrate the complications inherent in fragmented supply and demand-driven models of procurement and supply chain management, and suggest tools for navigating these hurdles that will ultimately result in more secure and reliable ARV provision. Understanding the dynamics of ARV supply chain is important for the global health community, both to ensure full and efficient treatment of persons living with HIV as well as to inform the supply chain decisions for other public health products.

SO ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Today, supply chain operations have entered the Industry 4.0 era. Technologies, such as blockchain, big-data, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing and cloud-computing, are all hot topics. Motivated by their importance, in this paper, we conduct a review of the closely related literature in the well-established mainstream operational research (OR) journals. From our research, we first examine the OR literature on Industry 4.0 related studies. Then we classify the technology-operations-related literature into three major categories, namely, information technologies for supply chain operations, technologies for sustainable operations, and technologies for production operations. Various less popular areas on technology-driven operations in supply chains, namely, technology licensing and outsourcing (TLO), online data, and risk, finance and security (RFS), are also examined. From the reviews, we identify the major research gaps. After that, we establish a future research agenda. We believed that this paper lays the foundation for further OR studies on technology-driven supply chain management in the Industry 4.0 era.

TI Support of Advanced Technologies in Supply Chain Processes and

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper aims to present a study of the type of advanced technologies used across manufacturing supply chains in supporting the main processes of the supply chain operations reference model (SCOR). It also intends to identify a set of sustainable performance indicators (environmental, economic, and social) suitable to evaluate a supply chain 4.0 (SC4.0). To attain this objective, based on the literature review, a conceptual model is proposed. The multiple case study is used with a cross-case comparison to identify the type of advanced technologies more commonly used in SC4.0, and the performance indicators more suitable for assessing a SC4.0 sustainability performance. A sample of ten case studies was considered with companies belonging to different manufacturing SCs, from different countries, and belonging to different echelons. Main findings revealed that the level of adoption of advanced technologies in the Supply Chain SCOR processes varies amongst the case studies. Some technologies are quite commonly used among the several SCOR processes and companies while others are seldom applied. Some indicators were also identified that are regarded as very or extremely suitable to evaluate the sustainability performance of a SC4.0. The main contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the empirical insights on the SC4.0 field and on Supply Chain Sustainability performance measurement. The results provide guidelines for the selection of advanced technologies to support SC processes and for the design of sustainable SC4.0 performance measurement systems.

TI 2D Multilayer solution for an electrified road with a built-in charging
   box
SO ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN
AB Charging electric vehicles inductively as they are being driven on the road is a conceivable option through a prefabricated charging box placed underneath the top asphalt layer of existing flexible pavements. Such a box inclusion however generates a material discontinuity in the pavement layer and points of singularities, inducing failure in the materials involved under heavy moving loads. To design such an electrified road, the specific model proposed here yields parametric calculations of multilayered structures embedded in a crack. By separating the problem into multiple zones across different material layers in a cross-sectional geometry, the multilayered solution presented provides all the mechanical fields and interface stresses between layers. On an electrified road case study from the literature, a vertical crack between box and material layer extends applicability of this mechanical solution to predicting failures like layer debonding. An alternative top pavement layer material is suggested for future developments.

Furthermore, this study finds that this moderating relationship is partially mediated by ICB.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is among the first to empirically test the effect of supply chain ambidexterity on sustainability performance by explicitly considering how leadership characteristics can both directly and indirectly affect the efficacy of this relationship. The findings complement existing literature by providing novel insights into the ability of firm supply chain strategy to affect sustainability performance.

TI PROMOTING HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN
   OPERATIONS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF KEY SUCCESS FACTORS USING THE
   ISM-MICMAC APPROACH
SO LOGFORUM
AB This study analyses key successful factors (KSFs) affecting health supply chains using a novel ISM-MICMAC methodology. Initially, KSFs were collected from past articles, which were later analyzed through the ISM-MICMAC methodology. Healthcare technologies (HCTs) are regarded as innovative and fastest-growing technologies and have seen advancement in the last few decades. Successful and sustainable delivery of health services is only possible through an effective supply chain and logistics network. However, HCTs confront pressure in healthcare supply chains due to different issues. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate KSFs affecting the successful delivery of HCTs supply chains. After obtaining data from experts, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) results indicated that initial capital, top management commitment, training & experience, new technology and information, information quality, and strategic partnership with suppliers are the most crucial KSFs HCTs supply chain in the Pakistani context. Furthermore, MICMAC analysis categorized KSFs with the help of their driving and dependence power. These results support health strategists and policymakers to understand the severity of the identified top five KSFs and act as a moderator to take care of these KSFs, which would ultimately contribute to the successful delivery of the health care supply chain and improvement of critical health services. This study's results would also be helpful for the supply chain managers of the manufacturing industry in the Pakistani context. This research is one of the initial studies to precisely explore KSFs affecting health supply chains using a novel ISM-MICMAC and categorize KSFs with the help of their driving and dependence power by applying MICMAC analysis in the Pakistani SCM context.

TI Location Allocation of Biorefineries for a Switchgrass-Based Bioethanol
   Supply Chain Using Energy Consumption and Emissions
SO LOGISTICS-BASEL
AB Background: Due to the growing demand for energy and environmental issues related to using fossil fuels, it is becoming tremendously important to find alternative energy sources. Bioethanol produced from switchgrass is considered as one of the best alternatives to fossil fuels. Methods: This study develops a two-stage supply chain modeling approach that first determines feasible locations for constructing switchgrass-based biorefineries in the state of North Dakota by using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis. In the second stage, the profit of the corresponding switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain is maximized by developing a mixed-integer linear program that aims to commercialize the bioethanol production while impacts of energy use and carbon emission costs on the supply chain decisions and siting of biorefineries are included. Results: The numerical results show that carbon emissions and energy consumption penalties affect optimal biorefinery selections and supply chain decisions. Conclusions: We conclude that there is no need to penalize both emissions and energy use simultaneously to achieve desirable environmental benefits, otherwise, the supply chain becomes non-profitable. Moreover, imposing emissions or energy consumption penalties makes the optimization model closer to supply sources while having higher land rental costs. Such policies would promote sustainable second-generation biomass production, thus decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.

   chain planning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Sustainable supply chains are the need of modern times. In order to make them successful, listening to voice of the customer and integrating them in the design and development phases of supply chains are very important. In this paper, we propose a technique called sustainability function deployment (SFD) developed on the concept of quality function deployment (QFD) to model customer and technical requirements, establish relationship between them and prioritise them for developing sustainable supply chains. SFD gathers customer and technical requirements for sustainable supply chain planning using C-REQ and T-REQ surveys, generates priority of customer requirements using Priority Matrix, performs screening of technical requirements using gap analysis, and generates requirements weights using QFD, thereby providing a structured approach to the decision-makers to select the right areas of improvement. Both the customer and technical requirements are captured from a socio-economic-environmental perspective. Results of application of the proposed technique are provided. The strength of the proposed approach is its novelty in integration of priority matrix and gap analysis in prioritising requirements based on their importance and performance in SFD. Besides, SFD facilitates modelling of complex, interrelated requirements in sustainable supply chain planning.

TI Sustainable Product and Supply Chain Design Decisions under
   Uncertainties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB Nowadays enterprises are forced to consider broader aspects while designing and manufacturing products. The scarcity of natural resources as well as stern environmental regulations have obliged enterprises to develop new products that can satisfy profit, people, and planet during its life cycle. In the last decade, many research efforts have incorporated supply chain and sustainability into product design. However, most of the studies provided deterministic based methodologies. Enterprises who intend to improve sustainability under various uncertainties couldn't find an appropriate method. The method based on fuzzy set theory is proposed in this study to tackle the uncertainty of supply chain and highlight the sustainable design concepts considering product disassemblability, closed loop supply chain performance, and carbon footprint. A scooter company case study is presented to demonstrate the advantage of this methodology. Because the risk of impreciseness of data could be reduced, decision-makers only have to provide suitable regions to express the costs and lead-time instead of exact numbers. This method can support decision-makers to make the most sustainable decisions which contain both product and the closed loop supply chain design based on the concern of lead-time, cost, and carbon footprint. As a result, sustainable product and supply chain design under uncertainties can be addressed at the product design stage.

TI Creating sustainable fresh food supply chains through waste reduction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The aim of this empirical paper is to study information sharing in fresh food supply chains, with a specific goal of reducing waste and facilitating sustainable performance. The study focuses on material and information flow issues, specifically on sharing demand and shelf-life data.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work has been designed as an exploratory case study in three fresh food supply chains, milk, fresh fish, and fresh poultry, in the Nordic countries. The cases are based on interviews and data from the databases of the companies involved. Each case focuses on analyzing information flow, particularly the current order patterns and forecasting and planning process, and material flow, focusing on the supply chain structure. In two cases significant changes have been made to forecasting processes and material flow, while the third case intends to identify the most beneficial uses of shared information to create a sustainable fresh food supply chain.
   Findings - The performance of the perishable food chain can be improved by more efficient information sharing. The key to improved operations is how and for which purposes the shared data should be used. In addition, changes in the supply chain structure were needed to speed up the deliveries and ensure shelf availability. The cross-case analysis revealed that improved performance was obtained with parallel changes in information sharing and usage and in material flow.
   Originality/value - Few studies approach the problem of waste and sustainability from an integrated supply chain perspective. This paper links data sharing with the sustainability performance of the supply chain as a whole.

AB The aim of this research is to conduct a review on the approaches used to assess different criteria on sustainability used by supply chains and to suggest a framework for a methodical approach that would be easy and practical in making complex sustainable assessments. A review was conducted on the present models that are used to examine sustainability within supply chains. A sample of 332 companies mainly from the manufacturing area was examined to determine what criteria they require for assessing sustainable issues amongst their supply chains. A quantitative study using factor analysis and multiple regression were used to analyse the data to determine the statistical significance of the attempted prediction. It was identified that corporate commitment to sustainability, corporate reporting and management systems are significant predictors for green procurement in supply chain management. This framework can be beneficial in implementing environmental sustainable assessments for supply chains. Much of the empirical research on supply chains has focused on business performance, while there is very little empirical work undertaken in the literature on sustainable supply chains. Sustainability within supply chains implies that businesses need to consider the economic, environmental and social impacts of their activities.

TI Collaboration for Sustainability in the Food Supply Chain: A Multi-Stage
   Study in Italy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, to analyze sustainability practices adopted in collaboration, including vertical collaboration i.e., with other actors or stages upstream or downstream in the supply chain, and horizontal collaboration i.e., with actors such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Secondly, to identify the sustainability performance expected from sustainability practices implemented in different supply chain stages. The study reports on a set of case studies representing four different food supply chain (FSC) stages: breeding/growing, processing, distribution and retail. The findings indicate that each stage selects different collaboration schemes for sustainability practices' implementation, prioritizing relations with upstream actors, namely grower/breeder, as these are key actors responsible for ensuring product quality and safety. In addition, the type of collaborative relationship is shown to be predominantly transactional for environmental and community practices, especially for solving specific short-term issues. Finally, varied areas of environmental and social sustainability performance are recognized, upstream and downstream, as a result of collaborative practices applied in different FSC stages, showing the diverse sustainability objectives pursued along the chain.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The vast majority of supply-chain literature has focused on supply chain management, innovation and sustainability, separately. However, little supply-chain research focuses on innovation under the supply chain context, which is expected to deliver a sustainable outcome. Is it a great research opportunity to explore or a subject unworthy of studying? This paper offers a systematic literature review considering 107 related papers published from 1996 to 2014. In this review, both descriptive and thematic analyses demonstrate it to be a great research opportunity worthy of exploring. A conceptual framework containing the definition of sustainable supply chain innovation (SSCI) and its distinctive characteristics are proposed and identified. Furthermore, some opportunities for the research in future, such as antecedents to SSCI, are suggested and discussed in this paper. Both academics and practitioners in companies might find this review useful as it stimulates further research and guides sustainable supply chain innovation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Resilience and cleaner production in industry 4.0: Role of supply chain
   mapping and visibility
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Industry 4.0 makes the business processes more autonomous, automated, and intelligent. Supply chain mapping can be a steppingstone to adopt the developments of Industry 4.0. Despite its profound significance in Industry 4.0 driven supply chain management, it has been hardly discussed in the research literature. Against this backdrop, the objective of this study is to test the impact of supply chain mapping on a firm's supply chain visibility and resilience. Data were collected from 154 Electrical & Electronics sector Malaysian firms through a close-ended questionnaire. The study employed structural equation modeling to analyze the hypothesized relationships. A significant momentous effect of supply chain mapping was found on the supply chain visibility and supply chain resilience. Further, the study also found a significant mediating role of supply chain visibility in the association between SC mapping and supply chain resilience. The findings of the study strongly suggest firms adopt a supply chain mapping strategy to improve supply chain visibility and supply chain resilience. Findings also suggest maintaining closer ties with key suppliers in order to increase SC visibility.

AB The aim of a sustainable supply chain is the strategic integration of all social, environmental and economic goals within an organization, through a systematic coordination of key business processes in order to improve the long-term economic performance of a company and its value chain. This paper describes a new methodological approach to support the strategy formulation process in sustainable supply chains. The proposed methodology combines three analytical tools (analytic hierarchical process, fuzzy multi-objective optimization, and clustering methods) within a strategy formulation process, integrating the competitive and corporative strategies with the supply chain strategy on the basis of sustainability. A case study in the Mexican Federal Commission of Electricity Gulf-Center Distribution Division shows the capability of our proposed framework. This company is large and complex enough to encompass the whole issue of the supply chain Results indicate that our methodology is a valid decision support tool to formulate a set of sustainable supply chain strategies, and it is able to generate a coordinated strategy for the management of a sustainable supply chain.

A viable supply chain is often characterized by resiliency, sustainability, and agility in its network design. Resiliency is essential because disruption and demand fluctuations are forced upon SCs, and the effects of these for many managerial supply chains are unknown. In addition, applying novel technology in the supply chain, such as blockchain, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) as agility tools can assist and enable the transition to lean production. This special issue of the Foundations of Computing and Decision Sciences is dedicated to advancements in this fields. Besides, the special issue covers instructional information about OR techniques which are useful for addressing real-world applications on such challenges.

TI Analysis of supply chain sustainability with supply chain complexity,
   inter-relationship study using delphi and interpretive structural
   modeling for Indian mining and earthmoving machinery industry
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB The context of the sustainable supply chain (SSC) is progressively getting attention among supply chain (SC) managers due to its competitive advantage in firms' performance. Increasing supply chain complexity (SCC) is argued as one of the biggest risks in achieving the organisational goal with an adverse impact on operational efficiency, cost, profitability, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. Though drivers of SSC and SCC have seemingly demonstrated mutual relationship in a practical scenario, supply chain managers tend to address respective drivers independently for managing and controlling. Limited availability of literature investigating interactions among drivers of SSC and SCC with its overall impact on the supply chain motivates deeper research. To address the gap, current research aims to study the mutual relationship between SSC and SCC drivers. To achieve this, a combination of sequential exploratory two-phased research methodology is adopted. The Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SSC and SCC drivers followed by using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to decipher the mutual relationship among the SSC and SCC drivers. The interactions between SSC and SCC drivers explored in this work will provide supply chain managers a framework for informed decision making. The driving and dependence power of drivers can guide SC practitioners to prioritize and focus on key drivers with a high impact on the overall outcome. The organization can also be benefitted by managing SSC and SCC drivers in synergy against the silo approach. The research finding suggests that market uncertainty, institutional regulations, strategic supplier collaboration, customer pressure, and new technologies are key five drivers in decision-making.

AB Today, the food industries are transforming towards interconnected global networks. Food safety scandals and globalization of food production has sparked heightened public attention to the risks in the supply chain from farms to consumers. In response, it is of great importance that food supply chains consistently provide high quality foods, safety guarantees and transparency.
   The assessment of the entire food supply chains should now be integrated with risks assessment, food quality and safety management, sustainability and traceability. For inventory management, the focus shifts from merely minimizing inventory costs, to carefully balancing with wastage and risks exposed.
   Consequently, this paper proposes a model to determine inventory and sourcing decisions in food supply chains. The model aims to minimize total costs and reduce wastes from unqualified items, while achieving necessary robustness in coping with risks generated. Food quality degradation is integrated in the final model for the purpose of product quality control throughout the food supply chain.

TI Sustainable supply chain Finance:Towards a research agenda
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Supply chain finance (SCF) as an effective method for improving supply chain (SC) financial performance has attracted attention from both academics and industries in recent years. In the development of SCF research and practice, there is growing interest in how SCF solutions help to promote SC sustainability performance. However, the research on sustainable SCF (SSCF) remains scant; both scholars and managers have not fully realized the significant economic, environmental, and social value behind this concept. This study, based on a systematic literature review of 47 articles related to SCF and sustainability, summarizes SSCF motives, practices and outcomes. In addition, to further investigate this emerging topic, this review discusses how SSCF solutions may help to drive sustainable SC enablers as well as mitigate sustainable SC barriers, which, in turn, improves sustainable SC performance. Based on the descriptive and thematic findings, this review then develops a conceptual framework that facilitates the conceptual development of SSCF. Finally, it identifies gaps in the existing literature and provides recommendations for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mitigating Environmental Impact of Perishable Food Supply Chain by a
   Novel Configuration: Simulating Banana Supply Chain in Sri Lanka
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As the world is moving into a sustainable era, achieving zero hunger has become one of the top three Sustainable Development Goals, applying a considerable amount of pressure on the agri-food systems to make decisions contemplating the sustainability dimensions. Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model.

Using a multi-case study of a sample of eight firms and relying on the foundations of complexity theory, this research recognises the complex operating environment of global multi-tier supply chains and reveals various mechanisms to effectively manage and facilitate the relationships with first- and lower-tier suppliers. Although institutional controls are important to manage the sustainability of first-tier suppliers, the findings posit that due to the inherent complexities of global multi-tier supply chains, duplicating institutional controls to lower-tier suppliers might not be effective. Therefore, firms should attempt to foster modest mechanisms that reinforce adaptation and self-organisation, for example, collaboration and guiding mechanisms, to effectively manage the sustainability of lower-tier suppliers. The research contributes to multi-tier sustainable supply chain management literature by exploring the different mechanisms to manage multi-tier supply chains and the inherent complexities that may impact on firms' endeavours in achieving their sustainability goals. Managers can utilise different contingent mechanisms to effectively manage the relationships with suppliers that are beyond their immediate visibility.

TI Risk Management of Supply Chain Green Finance Based on Sustainable
   Ecological Environment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green supply chain finance is a new financing method that focuses on corporate restructuring and promotes corporate capital flow and the development of environmental protection. This paper used BP neural network technology to study the green financing of the supply chain under the sustainable ecological environment. The method played an important role in the trial. Due to the more uncertain factors faced and the more complex environment, the risks of green supply chain finance are more hidden, diverse, and complex. The BP neural network is relatively mature in both network theory and performance. Its outstanding advantages are its strong nonlinear mapping ability and flexible network structure. The positive effect of BP neural network on green financial risk management is verified by experiments. Green supply chain finance is an innovative model of green finance. This experiment studies the risk management of green finance in supply chain and the evaluation index of green finance risk management through BP neural network method, and shows that the evaluation results are highly scientific. In addition, based on the green supply chain model, the historical data of different regions provide a scientific basis for the sustainable ecological development of the region. This paper provides guidance for the sustainable development of green finance in the supply chain and makes contributions to promoting the development of green economy. In order to control the risks of supply chain financing business, the risks of supply chain financing business are classified and analyzed, and specific project risk levels and points are determined to propose control measures to ensure effective control of the business risks.

TI How assessment and cooperation practices influence suppliers? adoption
   of sustainable supply chain practices: An inter-organizational learning
   perspective
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A lack of transparency and the relative invisibility of social and environmental issues in supply chains render the implementation of sustainability without the involvement of suppliers difficult. For this, buying companies apply different sustainable supply chain management practices. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether buying companies' assessment and cooperation practices enable suppliers to adopt similar practices and thereby further cascade social sustainability requirements to sub-suppliers. While both practices' effects on suppliers' sustainability performance have been investigated, this question has not yet been adequately addressed. To ensure social sustainability along the entire supply chain, we need a deeper understanding of the relationships between the sustainable supply chain management practices of buyers and suppliers. We respond to calls to further investigate the role of inter-organizational learning in the context of sustainability in supply chains. As the supplier perspective remains under-researched in the literature, we conducted a survey among manufacturing sector suppliers in Germany. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between buying companies' assessment and cooperation practices and suppliers' adoption of sustainable supply chain management practices. Our findings reveal that there is a trickle-down effect of sustainable supply chain practices from buying companies to suppliers, and from suppliers to sub -suppliers. Only cooperation practices prove to be effective for the development of suppliers' sustainability ca-pabilities, in contrast to assessment practices. Our findings contribute to the literature on sustainable supply chain management by providing a key building block for understanding the effects of assessment and cooper-ation practices. We are among the first to provide insights on the mechanism of cascading sustainable supply chain management practices in supply chains.

AB Sustainability is a necessity in the design and operation of supply chains. The triple bottom line (TBL) accounting of sustainability needs to incorporate economic, environmental and social pillars simultaneously in the decision making process. The business strategy can be developed to promote sustained growth, also incorporating in the supply chain management issues as a business strategy rather than philanthropy. Deciding on the location of business facilities, supplier-manufacturer network, manufacturer-demand location network and the supplier- manufacturer relation strategy are among the important decisions in business strategy and supply chain management. However, there is a lack of theoretical work which analyzes the business strategy together with TBL concept of sustainability for the supply chain network design problem. In this paper, a methodological approach based on mathematical programming is proposed that conforms to the TBL accounting for supply chain network design problem from suppliers to customers embedded with business strategy and green energy usage option. A realistic case study is applied to the model. The results show that working with inclusive suppliers and using green energy are preferred with highest profit value.

TI Stakeholders integration in higher education: supply chain approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB Supply chain management principles have emerged in the last decade as a strategic option to meet new challenges in global business environment. Viewing business environment as part of a chain, starting from raw material suppliers to end customers passing by producers, is at the heart of supply-chain management. Many management principles have emerged for better planning and controlling this chain to the benefit of all parties involved. This paper explores the implications of supply-chain management principles on higher education. First, a supply-chain view of higher education is described and its environment is analysed for the possibility of adopting supply-chain principles. Features that might be catalysts or hurdles towards these principles are identified. Second, a framework for supply-chain coordination and integration in higher education that takes into consideration these features are developed. Finally, existing practices that address supply-chain in higher education are identified and some new practices representing a natural extension of supply-chain management practices are suggested. A potential case study for implementing these concepts is presented.

AB Food safety is related to people's health and the sustainable development of the food supply chain, so it is of crucial practical significance to study food supply chain quality management. This paper employs the evolutionary game method to develop a tripartite evolutionary game model that reflects the interaction of interests among food raw material suppliers, food manufacturers, and consumers. It identifies the key factors that influence the decision-making of each game participant and attempts to use these factors to guide the behavior of the food supply chain members scientifically. The study results demonstrate that sustainable management of food supply chains can be improved by strengthening the intensity of government supervision, narrowing the production cost gap between high-quality and poor-quality food raw materials, improving the inspection ability of the food manufacturer, increasing complaint incentives of consumers, etc. Finally, this paper puts forward suggestions and countermeasures for the government to improve the supervision mechanism of food safety, thereby achieving sustainable management of the food supply chain.

TI Peripherization of Indemnificatory Housing Community under Land-Centered
   Urban Transformation: The Case of Nanjing, China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Indemnificatory housing programs-a kind of state-backed urban low-end and nonmarket housing programs which used to be welfare-have now increasingly evolved to be the vehicle to promote capital accumulation. Most of these housing communities show peripherization with high rates of unemployment, low income, poverty, and social exclusion, which violates their sustainability. This paper examines the impacts of land-centered urban transformation on indemnificatory housing communities, and analyzes the causes of unsustainable outcomes in political economy discourse. To achieve this, the social and economic conditions of a longstanding suburban indemnificatory housing community in Nanjing were analyzed. Survey data collected from March to April 2016 was evaluated to determine the peripherization of the residents within it. We found that for many residents, high rates of unemployment, low income, and poverty were mainly caused by their individual demographic and socioeconomic disadvantages, with the peripheral physical and social location contributing by exacerbating their vulnerabilities. It is concluded that local governments' land-centered urban transformation and the central government's affordable housing policies aimed at social and economic crisis mitigation combine to produce suburban indemnificatory housing communities, driving low-income relocated residents into more disadvantaged situations. This finding creates important lessons for the sustainable development of Chinese indemnificatory housing communities.

SO SCIENTIA IRANICA
AB Rice is a strategic commodity in the food chain for the people and governments. It is a fundamental food for many societies. Moreover, producing rice can provide a reliable source of revenue if proper supply chain management is coordinated by farmer countries. The rice supply chain includes diverse elements such as farms, rice mills, distribution centers, and markets. This study examines the important factors that play a significant role in the rice supply chain. A bi-objective mathematical model is formulated to minimize total costs as an economic goal and minimize soil erosion and its destruction due to the consumed water for rice cultivation as an environmental goal. To verify the viability of the proposed model, a case study of the rice supply chain with limited producer farms has been investigated. Moreover, some parameters such as annual precipitation in production areas along with other factors are presented under several scenarios. Furthermore, an extended goal programming approach and stochastic programming are utilized to solve the proposed model. Finally, the sensitivity analyses of the important parameters have been performed.

TI Inventory Transshipment Considering Greenhouse Gas Emissions for
   Sustainable Cross-Filling in Cold Supply Chains
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, sustainable supply chain management has gained increasing attention, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout supply chains have been identified as one of the most important sustainability issues. This paper presents an investigation of the problem of transshipment among distribution centers (DCs) in a cold supply chain to achieve sustainable inventory cross-filling. Although transshipment is an effective tool for supply chain pooling, the possibility of increased GHG emissions raises environmental concerns. This study establishes a sustainable cold-chain logistics model that considers GHG emissions from DC storage and transshipment trucks. The new sustainable cold-chain model also reflects laden status and cargo weights of trucks for accurate emission assessment. An optimization model is also developed to minimize both GHG emissions and costs in the cold chain. Numerical simulations are conducted for diverse problem cases to examine important problem characteristics. The result analysis identifies that inventory service levels and demand variability have a strong impact on GHG emissions in transshipment; small p-values in the statistical analysis verify the significance of this effect. The different effects of demand variability and service levels on each emission source are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that transshipment among DCs can effectively reduce both GHG emissions and costs in cold supply chains. This study provides useful models and tools to assess GHG emissions and optimize decisions for the design and operation of transshipment. The proposed models will enable the assessment of sustainable alternatives and achieve sustainability objectives effectively for cold supply chains.

AB This paper addresses a coordination problem of production and green transportation and the effects of production and transportation coordination on supply chain sustainability in a global supply chain environment with the consideration of important realistic characteristics, including parallel machines, different order processing complexities, fixed delivery departure times, green transportation and multiple transportation modes. We formulate the measurements for carbon emissions of different transportation modes, including air, sea and land transportation. A hybrid genetic algorithm-based optimization approach is developed to handle this problem, in which a hybrid genetic algorithm and heuristic procedures are combined. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by means of various problem instances. We observe that the coordination of production and green transportation has a large effect on the overall supply chain sustainability, which can reduce the total supply chain cost by 9.60% to 21.90%.

AB Supply chain plays a key role for the success of an enterprise in gaining competitive edge, markets demanding agility and quick market responsiveness, which represent complex phenomena in global competition. To discover the behavior and mechanism of organization, nowadays, more and more people have paid attention to the complexity theory such as self-organization, dissipative structure theory, synergetic theory, etc. The paper introduces the concept of self-organization theories and supply chain firstly. Then enlightened by the systematical methodology, the paper puts forward the concept of sustainability of organization on the basis of analyzing the characteristics of self-organized supply chain. A thorough analysis of the mechanism of supply chain sustainability has been made accordingly. Finally, the paper adopts the supply chain system of TCL Group as an example, indicating that the success of TCL Group is mostly due to its effective and efficient self-organized supply chain.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Despite the benefits resulting from the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in the agri-food sector, the adoption of digital technologies for preventing and/or reducing food loss and waste (FLW) across the agri-food supply chain is still under investigation. In fact, enhancing and optimizing agri-food supply chain operations through digital technologies would just represent a partial effort if FLW prevention and reduction are not effectively addressed. Although companies are starting to adopt digital technologies for eliminating FLW from their operations, the implementation process and the achieved results are generally presented at a superficial level and practical guidance is still missing. This systematic literature review contributes to theory by developing a framework analyzing the state-of-the-art of adoption of each Industry 4.0 technology across the agri-food supply chain, and providing a research agenda structured around the main themes of research design, digital technologies, contextual differences, governance, and sustainability. Eventually, the study also informs managers in the agri-food industry about the potential implementation of digital technologies for preventing and reducing FLW in across the agri-food supply chain.

AB This paper presents the results of one-year period in situ experiment designed to monitor the temperatures beneath a real ground floor slab in a passive house. Experimental measurements of the subsoil temperatures were performed outside and under the foundation (at various depths and locations) of a timber frame passive house. The results of the experimental measurements of the subsoil temperatures under the foundation of the passive house showed higher temperatures than predicted in standard calculating procedures and moreover they are not included in the calculations at all. This paper also reports the results of the calculation procedures proposed by the standards for slab-on-ground heat transfer. In the following paragraphs, the analytical detailed calculation procedure of CSN EN ISO 13370:2009, the analytical simplified method of CSN EN 12831:2004 and the numerical simulation methods of CSN EN ISO 10211:2009 are described and compared. Different boundary conditions (external design temperatures and external measured temperatures) were used. The ground temperatures were not included in the calculation procedures; only the thermal conductivity of the ground was respected. In particular, a two-dimensional finite element model, was used to simulate the heat transfer beneath a ground floor slab into the soil. The results showed that this model is more suitable tools to predict the thermal performance of the slab-on-ground floor than simplified analytical methods.

AB In spite of the growth in the body of green supply chain management, it is still difficult to understand the environmental sustainability practices involved in supply chain management (SCM) activities. This is an interdisciplinary field and the scope of GSCM practices is broad covering from green purchasing to integrated life-cycle management. This paper focuses on upstream supply chain management activities, which are usually responsible for diffusing environmental sustainability practices across the supply base. Therefore, peer-reviewed papers focused on the diffusion of environmental sustainability practices across manufacturing supply chain base are examined. It is found that this diffusion is sharply related to the purchasing, performance assessment and collaboration. These upstream activities are affected by internal functions and the maturity level of environmental and culture of organisation. In addition, upstream SCM activities are better designed taking into account the characteristics of products and processes, mainly in terms of the inputs and outputs environmental aspects. This research can help manufactures to access example of environmental sustainability practices commonly reported in supply chain management field. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Supply chain finance combines logistics, information flow and capital flow, which can effectively solve the shortage of funds and reduce the cost of the entire supply chain. Based on the development background of Fujian province's free trade zone and supply chain finance, this paper analyzes the current situation of SME financing in China and Fujian province, and focuses on the insufficient industrial chain of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone. Supply chain financial intermediaries are unbalanced development, inadequate laws and regulations, and relatively weak technology. The paper proposes a comprehensive model of supply chain financing based on free trade zone, carries out QFLP financing for the real economy, develops supply chain financial services for shipping centers, and encourages intermediaries to develop supply chain financial services, improve credit system and legal system, and utilize blockchain technology to improve the informationization degree of supply chain finance and other proposals, promote the rapid development of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone, and solve the financing difficulties of SMEs.

TI Supply chain management: exploring the intellectual structure
SO SCIENTOMETRICS
AB The purpose of this article is to explore the intellectual structure of supply chain management area by employing a co-citation method. Data was collected (4652 articles and 145,242 references) from the Web of Science online database. Author productivity and 41 frequently cited articles were identified through citation and document co-citation analysis. The result of this study identified four core topics to supply chain management research: sustainable supply chain management, strategic competition, value of information, and development of supply chain management. This study illustrates the shift in the intellectual structure of SCM, indicating research priorities, such as sustainability in supply chain management, relationships among organisations, the bullwhip effect within the supply chain, and performance measurement in supply chain management. This study implies that managers should expend effort formulating effective performance measurements in supply chain management and share information within the supply chain to mitigate the bullwhip effect.

TI An optimization model for a sustainable and socially beneficial
   four-stage supply chain
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Embedding a culture of working with social benefits within an organization is at an all-time high these days. This paper assists in better understanding and articulating the economic, environmental, and social aspects of the sustainable four-stage supply chain. The proposed research incorporates input from all four phases of the supply chain (supplying raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing of finished goods, and selling them to customers). Three conflicting objective functions have been developed: cost minimization, emission minimization, and social benefit maximization. A multi-objective optimization model has been formulated subject to the usual supply and demand constraints, balancing constraints, capacity constraints, and many more. The weighted sum approach has been used to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Finally, two real-life case studies to validate the proposed model have been presented: the lead-acid battery supply chain and the disposable syringe supply chain. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Crossing the chasm: investigating the relationship between
   sustainability and resilience in supply chain management
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB In recent years, several studies have been conducted on the joint investigation of sustainability and supply chain resilience. However, they revealed the presence of divergent viewpoints in discussing the sustainability-resilience relationship. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Network Analysis that combines the traditional systematic literature review with bibliometric techniques to analyse how the relationship between supply chain sustainability and supply chain resilience has been addressed by previous literature in the main research thematic areas of the field. The analysis revealed the presence of four perspectives for organizing the concepts of supply chain sustainability and supply chain resilience, sustainability and resilience are considered to be two different concepts that rely on separate and distinguishable goals, resilience is considered a component of sustainability, sustainability is considered a component of resilience, and they are considered as synonyms. The rationale for the presence of different perspectives can be identified in the level of detail with which sustain-ability and resilience objectives are considered. As a result, an original framework is developed to explain the different perspectives and link them with the emerging research streams of the literature. Research allows for providing conceptual clarity on definitions and the combination of resilience and sustainability to build a solid theoretical background for academics and to help effectively drive managerial decisions.

AB Hydrophilic mineral wool panels can be used in extensive vegetation green roof systems as a soil replacement. They are lightweight (also with full water saturation), have certified thermal insulation properties in wet conditions and beyond all, they have laboratory approval of vertical and horizontal drainage ability, similar as a special drainage NEP composites.
   Low weight of panels is further more advantageous in the intensive green roof systems and passive houses- static demands on roof and wall constructions can be dramatically decreased. Special water-accumulation panels can be used in retention roofs. Multiple-layered panels can help with thermal properties of building envelope of passive houses.

TI RESEARCH ON ECOLOGICAL GREEN BUILDING SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MODEL
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB In recent years, the construction industry is facing a series of problems such as severe resource waste, environmental pollution, and high energy consumption. This article takes ecological green buildings as the starting point and fully considers the coordination of ecological green building raw material suppliers, construction enterprises, government departments and other units. In the operational relationship, the ecological green building supply chain management model and the multi-level recycling management model of the internal ecological green building supply chain were constructed. In addition, the ecological green building level of 10 construction enterprises in M area was studied by SPSS cluster analysis. The results show that: 1) Eco-green building supply chain management model covers building developers, construction contracting enterprises, materials, equipment suppliers, government departments and other participating units, fully considering the coordination and interaction between each participating unit. Therefore, the operation of the entire building supply chain is smoother. 2) The multi-level recycling management model of the internal eco-green building supply chain can realize the diversification of recovery and construction work from the bottom level, to the restoration, warehousing and treatment of high-level multi-level recycling, and achieve the goal of sustainable development. 3) The results of cluster analysis show that the C2, C9 and C6 construction companies in M region have leading indicators such as resource integration capability, green building material capability and green construction technology capability, which is a high-level green building supply chain management level enterprise in the region.

TI Transforming chemical supply chains toward sustainability-A
   practice-based view
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In today's business, it is largely acknowledged that sustainability has to be considered in managerial decision making and corporate strategy development. However, many firms still face substantial operational and organizational challenges when striving for a transformation toward sustainability, especially when expanding their efforts toward their supplier base. Framed by the recently emerging theoretical lens of the practice-based view and its extension toward the supply chain practice view, and grounded in recent conceptualizations of sustainable supply chain management, the study at hand elaborates on management practices by which firms can improve the sustainability of their supply chains. Due to its high economic relevance and its exposure to increasing sustainability requirements, the chemical process industry is chosen as the empirical research field. Qualitative case study research identifies intra- and inter-organizational practices that are important to achieve and improve supply chain sustainability. A framework that conceptualizes sustainability practices and their implementation prerequisites and performance impacts is derived from interviews with key informants from German chemical manufacturers. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art of sustainability diffusion in particular through its distinct focus on imitable practices that are easily transferable between companies and hence may help in transforming entire industry sectors toward sustainability.

TI A value chain analysis for sustainable development of olive oil
   agro-industry: The case of Algeria
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This study analyzes the performance of the olive oil value chain in Algeria and identifies the bottlenecks that must be overcome to achieve sustainable development. Surveys were carried out and interviews conducted during a five-year period. Value chain approach was used as a tool to analyze the entire chain. The results showed that despite the value chain was found to be profitable for all chain actors, significant shortcomings and bottlenecks continue to undermine the overall development of the value chain. Major bottlenecks to improve productivity and value added were the poor agricultural practice and institutional environment; issues related to natural, structural, technology and economic environment; lack of market transparency; market uncertainties; lack of quality control; absence of traceability monitoring system throughout the chain; lack of certification and labelling; almost total absences of organized structures exist around the product; and limited effectiveness of agricultural extension services with low involvement of farmers and millers in professional organization related to olive oil industry. However, Algeria's olive oil value chain has great potential for future development and currently, the country has an important advantage in terms of current development policies, the use of technology, and the extension of olive tree acreage. Nevertheless, the following upgrading strategies are recommended to enhance sustainability: improvement in product and process; changing in functional position; access to market; supply; cross distribution chain; and intra-chain linkage.

TI Social Sustainability Strategy across the Supply Chain: A Conceptual
   Approach from the Organisational Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Much of the existing literature on the social aspects of sustainability in the supply chain has focused on dyadic buyer-supplier relationships. However, supply chains are much more extensive, featuring multi-tiered systems consisting of many interconnected sequential and parallel dyadic relationships; therefore, a more expansive and holistic approach to exploring the management and integration of social sustainability standards across the extended supply chain is desirable. This research attempts to help fill this void and considers the extent to which a series of sequential upstream and downstream supply chain partners, rather than only a focal organization's immediate suppliers and buyers, influence the formulation process of the social aspects of a sustainability strategy and the deployment of associated practices across the extended supply chain. Findings in the literature indicate that, inter alia, sustainability efforts in the supply chain are likely to be guided by stakeholders' sustainability desires/requirements, the geographical location of buyers and suppliers and the associated sustainability enforcement regulations and cultural norms, and the volume of trade between the buyer and supplier. This paper uses the results gleaned from a review of the literature to propose a conceptual framework for selection of sustainability strategy across the multi-tiered supply chain. Finally, we introduce a conceptual approach to the process of implementing and deploying the social aspects of sustainability strategies and practices across the supply chain using an integrated social-sustainability information management system (ISIMS).

TI The socio-economic force field of the creation of short food supply
   chains in Europe
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AND NUTRITION RESEARCH
AB It is a clear contradiction that while, on a verbal level, there is a mushrooming of declarations on the importance of a specific form of circular economy and short supply chains in sustainable rural development, these systems hardly exist in the new member states of the European Union (EU). The current article offers a possible explanation for this paradox and suggests some policy measures to enhance the role of these systems. Applying the approach of institutional economics and force field theory, and based on expert estimations from ten EU member states using the MACTOR method, the authors determined the influence-dependence relations between relevant actors and the actor-goal connections in the socio-economic systems relevant to short supply chains in EU member states. It was proven that in the new member states of the EU the considerable cost-efficiency advantages of global supply chains paired with the high level of influence of multinational trading companies are, in most cases, more important factors than sustainable development. The relatively low propensity to pay for local products on the part of the population of new EU member states further decreases possibilities for short supply chain development. The concluding remarks also include suggestions for policy makers.

TI A roadmap for sustainability assessment in the food supply chain
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB Purpose To develop a roadmap of sustainability practices and assessment mechanisms to advance in the sustainable supply chain (SSC) performance assessment in the food supply chain. The analysis is grounded on the contingency and stakeholder theories. Design/methodology/approach The study follows a multiple case study approach analyzing the sustainability practices implementation and assessment across different supply chain stages in the food industry in Italy. The set of cases comprises 12 companies in the fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV), and seven companies in the "Balsamic Vinegar of Modena" (BVM) supply chains. Findings The sustainability practices and assessment in each company in both supply chains according to their objectives are identified. Different stakeholder pressures for sustainability implementation and assessment are analyzed. The contingency factors that foster sustainability assessment are outlined as well. Finally, the study develops a roadmap with five levels of progress considering the groups of practices implemented and the type of assessment applied. Practical implications The roadmap is a decision-making tool for planning and monitoring progress on SSC performance along five possible levels of progress. While identifying the assessment mechanisms implemented for different kind of sustainability practices, companies can develop a strategy according to their aims and capabilities and stakeholder's expectations. Originality/value The novelties in this study are threefold. First, the roadmap with five levels of progress. Second, investigating two different food supply chains that allowed for a broader view regarding sustainability practices and assessment. Third, the adoption of stakeholder and contingency theories in SSC studies.

TI Big data analytics as an operational excellence approach to enhance
   sustainable supply chain performance
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Operations management is a core organizational function involved in the management of activities to produce and deliver products and services. Appropriate operations decisions rely on assessing and using information; a task made more challenging in the Big Data era. Effective management of data (big data analytics; BDA), along with staff capabilities (the talent capability in the use of big data) support firms to leverage big data analytics and organizational learning in support of sustainable supply chain management outcomes. The current study uses dynamic capability theory as a foundation for evaluating the role of BDA capability as an operational excellence approach in improving sustainable supply chain performance. We surveyed mining executives in the emerging economy of South Africa and received 520 valid responses (47% response rate). We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data. The findings show that big data analytics management capabilities have a strong and significant effect on innovative green product development and sustainable supply chain outcomes. Big data analytics talent capabilities have a weaker but still significant effect on employee development and sustainable supply chain outcomes. Innovation and learning performance affect sustainable supply chain performance, and supply chain innovativeness has an important moderating role. A contribution of the study is identifying two pathways that managers can use to improve sustainable supply chain outcomes in the mining industry, based on big data analytics capabilities.

TI Upstream complex power relationships and firm's reputation in global
   value chains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Previous research into the upstream supply chain governance mechanisms that focal firms use with suppliers to improve their ethical performance and reputation is incipient. The original contribution includes the development of empirical model using global value chain and transaction cost perspective by exploring the complex power relationship between upstream supply chain governance mechanisms (Modular, relational and captive), value co-creation efforts, sustainable ethical performance and reputation through an original survey of companies from an emerging economy - India. The results indicate that, supplier modular and relational governance mechanisms have an impact on suppliers' ethical performance, supply chain performance and reputation. Additionally, suppliers' ethical performance plays a mediating role between governance mechanisms in upstream supply chain networks and the supply chain performance and reputation of focal companies. In agreement with the literature, focal firms' sustainability-related value co-creation activities were found to positively influences the ethical performance of both suppliers' and focal firms' reputation. This provides implications for practitioners which was previously unknown with respect to food supply chains.

   global supply chains
SO GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY
AB Violations of fundamental labour rights have been a problem in global supply chains for decades. Recently, public procurement is increasingly used to regulate labour standards in global chains. Based on previous research on private actors, which distinguished between compliance-focused and commitment-focused enforcement strategies, this article discusses the problems and means of enforcing respect for labour rights in global supply chains. By applying this distinction to public procurement, this article develops a concept of enforcement styles for public procurement as a tool to regulate labour in global supply chains.

TI Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chain Network Design under Disruption
   Risks
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable supply chain network design is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has potential to affect supply chain performance. Increasing regulations for carbon and waste management are forcing firms to consider their supply chains from ecological and social objectives, but in reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them are disrupted from time to time, due to poor weather, natural or manmade disasters or a combination of any other factors. Supply chain systems drop their sustainability objectives while coping with these unexpected disruptions. Hence, the new challenges for supply chain managers are to design an efficient and effective supply chain network that will be resilient enough to bounce back from any disruption and that also should have sufficient vigilance to offer same sustainability under a disruption state. This paper focuses on ecological sustainability, because an environmental focus in a supply chain system is more important and also links with other pillars of sustainability, as the products need to be produced, packed and transported in an ethical way, which should not harm social balance and the environment. Owing to importance of the considered issue, this paper attempts to introduce a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by incorporating (1) sustainability via carbon emissions and embodied carbon footprints and (2) resilience by incorporating location-specific risks. The proposed goal programming (GP) model optimizes the total cost, while considering the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain network.

TI Going Green Through Green Supply Chain Initiatives Towards Environmental
   Sustainability
SO OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB In recent years the natural environment becomes a major global issue. Due to increasing human and industrial impacts on the environment, environmental issues become more intense and widespread. In this regard, businesses need to place equal footing both on the environment and on their business objectives. This paper is an attempt to clarify the path towards that end and highlight steps to be taken by business organizations through green supply chain to make sustainable development a reality. Specifically the paper is interested to investigate the adoption of green supply chain initiatives. Three green supply chain initiatives e.g. green purchasing, eco-design, and reverse logistics were studied. The survey data was obtained from ISO 14001 certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The survey was conducted using structured mail questionnaire directed to the environmental management representative (EMR) in each firm. The results showed that ecodesign is the most adopted green supply chain initiative followed by green purchasing, while reverse logistics showed the lowest level of adoption. The result of the t-test revealed that there are no significant differences in green supply chain initiatives between firm ages and type of product. However, firms with large supplier base (more than 10 suppliers) are found to be significantly higher in green purchasing and eco-design than firms with lower supplier base. The result of the t-test disclosed also that firms that participate in green interested associations have significantly higher level of adoptions of green supply chain initiatives than firms that do not participate. Green supply chain initiatives can play significant role in achieving the "triple bottom line" of social, environmental, and economic benefits and, therefore, contributing to sustainable development of the society.

TI Optimal pricing policy in a three-layer dual-channel supply chain under
   government subsidy in green manufacturing
SO MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
AB As global governments pay more attention to environmental issues, the idea of environmental protection has now been incorporated into the supply chain, and green supply chain management has become particularly significant. As such, this paper proposes a three-layer green supply chain model with a dual-channel structure consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer. The manufacturer sells the product through a (a) traditional retail-channel or (b) direct online-channel. The manufacturer sets a green product standard, while the government offers a subsidy to the manufacturer for green investment. We analyze the optimal decision under government subsidy and no government subsidy to maintain the profit maximization criteria of the supply chain. In addition, both the centralized and decentralized marketing strategies are evaluated using the Stackelberg game approach. To achieve the best pricing decisions for supply chain members, we compare the optimal pricing under consistent and inconsistent sales prices in both online and offline channels. The prime objective of the paper is to explore and compare the optimal pricing strategy with and without government subsidy pertaining to maximizing the overall profit of the supply chain. The numerical illustration and sensitivity analysis indicate that government subsidy can reduce the cost of green items and is beneficial to both manufacturer and supplier. Our research findings can lead to better decisions with and without government subsidy for members of the dual-channel green supply chain as well as enhance green product market competitiveness.(c) 2022 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).

SE Advances in E-Business Research (AEBR) Book Series
AB The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most innovative and research-intensive industries in the world. For example, five out of the top global Research and Development (R&D) companies were pharmaceutical companies. However, the industry is lagging behind other industries in adopting Business-to-Business (B2B) and supply chain technologies. With supply chain costs constituting around 25-40% of an organization's operating expenses, it is imperative for senior pharmaceutical executives to minimize this cost. Hence, the main objective of this chapter is to identify key B2B e-commerce management, evaluation, and benefits realization factors and challenges within the Australian pharmaceutical supply chain. The results of this study suggest that pharmaceutical companies not only need to carefully examine their B2B investment management and evaluation practices but also must invest in using appropriate evaluation methodologies for identifying and managing benefits, risks, and costs associated with their investments in B2B and supply chains.

TI Developing a model for supply chain agility and innovativeness to
   enhance firms' competitive advantage
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose Developing agility and innovativeness as dynamic capabilities are important for firms to sustain their competitive advantage in today's global economy. The purpose of this paper is to develop and empirically test a framework to investigate how the supply chain agility and innovativeness are achieved through IT integration and trust in members of supply chain and how these, in turn, can enhance firms' competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach This research employs a survey method and data are collected from senior managers working in the supply chain or IT area. The model and hypotheses are tested utilizing data from 204 usable Taiwan manufacturing firms via structural equations modeling methodology. Findings The study demonstrates that both IT integration and trust in supply chain members significantly enhance supply chain agility and innovativeness, which in turn positively affect firm's competitive advantage. The results indicate that IT integration and trust are antecedents and major joint partnership resources for improving supply chain agility and innovativeness. Research limitations/implications - Data are collected from manufacturing industry in Taiwan and single respondent from each firm, the generalizability of current findings to other industries or countries should require additional investigation. Practical implications - The study suggests that a firm should focus on IT integration and trust in supply chain members to achieve supply chain agility and innovativeness. To take advantage of supply chain agility and innovativeness, through maximizing firm's competitive advantage, firms should continually adapt to the fast changing business environment and search for creative ways to satisfy new market needs. Originality/value Given the attention paid to supply chain agility and innovativeness in terms of importance to responding to business uncertainty and competitiveness, and more recently, as important capabilities in managing supply chain management, this paper investigates how IT integration and trust can contribute to supply chain agility and innovativeness. Provide evidence regarding the impact of IT integration and trust on agility of supply chains, innovativeness and competitive advantage.

TI Optimisation of a social housing for south of Brazil: From basic
   performance standard to passive house concept
SO ENERGY
AB The paper aims to discuss the adaptation of a brazilian social housing project to the Passive House standard, by defining the thermal envelope construction fabric for different climates of southern Brazil, from a base line according to the Brazilian performance standard. The study was developed in 4 steps, where a numerical model was set up and runned in a transient regime, using EnergyPlus (R) software. In the first step, the thermal and energy performance of the reference base model was assessed. In the second step, a sensitivity analysis was performed, varying the thermal envelope parameters of the building case study, in order to satisfy the minimum performance of the classification level A, according to the Brazilian Energy Efficiency Regulation (RTQ-R). In a third step, the external envelope of the building was optimised, through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In a last step, the numerical model defined according to the Passive House standard was optimised, in order to obtain optimal solutions. Thermal and energy performance and economic viability of the solutions were analysed. Solutions attending to RTQ-R presented additional investment between 26% and 27% and solutions attending to Passive House standard presented additional costs of 39% and 42% for the three bioclimatic zones.

TI Learning from Early Adopters of Blockchain Technology: A Systematic
   Review of Supply Chain Case Studies
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Blockchain technology is widely seen as a promising technology for global supply chains, though early adoption of the technology is both costly and risky. Along with many other discouraging factors, large investments required to enter or develop a blockchain raise barriers to entry. Concerns about potential benefits, on the other hand, have led to companies questioning whether it is worth it. Consequently, many players in the global arena are still preferring to wait by observing current practices before making investments, while trying to figure out what the technology might bring them. Hence, the main purpose of this paper is to research various implementations of blockchain technology in supply chains, in order to learn from its early adopters. For this purpose, we chose case studies as the research method, which we used in a systematic way. We focused on multiple relevant case studies from previous research concerning the use of blockchain technology in supply chain practices. Through a systematic analysis of case studies, the paper aims at bringing forward different views, approaches, and results about blockchain adoption, as a way to show the pros and cons of adopting the technology under certain circumstances. The research was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. This paper contributes to the literature by showcasing the use of blockchain in supply chains via multiple cases to learn from early blockchain adopters in supply chain practices.

TI Benchmarking global supply chains: the power of the 'ethical audit'
   regime
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB This article critically investigates the growing power and effectiveness of the ethical' compliance audit regime. Over the last decade, audits have evolved from a tool for companies to track internal organisational performance into a transnational governing mechanism to measure and strengthen corporate accountability globally and shape corporate responsibility norms. Drawing on original interviews, we assess the effectiveness of supply chain benchmarks and audits in promoting environmental and social improvements in global retail supply chains. Two principal arguments emerge from our analysis. First, that audits can be best understood as a productive form of power, which codifies and legitimates retail corporations' poor social and environmental records, and shapes state approaches to supply chain governance. Second, that growing public and government trust in audit metrics ends up concealing real problems in global supply chains. Retailers are, in fact, auditing only small portions of supply chains, omitting the portions of supply chains where labour and environmental abuse are most likely to take place. Furthermore, the audit regime tends to address labour and environmental issues very unevenly, since people' are more difficult to classify and verify through numbers than capital and product quality.

AB The Circular Economy approach has gained attention recently. Supply Chains have an important role in the transition to a more circular economy. Thus, being able to assess structurally the circularity of multi-activity Supply Chains is essential to help Supply Chain managers to decide in this transition. An important number of Supply Chains' indicators are proposed in the literature in the context of sustainability. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no tool, which specifically classifies those indicators according to Circular Supply Chain structures, involving circular activities such as reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing. The aim of this work is to develop such a classification tool for indicators in order to assess the circularity of Supply Chains at the strategic level. This classification tool relies on the three main principles of circular value creation of Ellen MacArthur Foundation. These principles are converted into different dimensions that could be applied to the structures of Circular Supply Chains. These dimensions constitute classification criteria for our tool. In this work, new potential Circular Supply Chain indicators are also proposed and classified by the tool. This tool allows and facilitates academics and Supply Chain managers categorizing and choosing appropriate indicators to assess circularity within Circular Supply Chains.

AB Under the environment of economic globalization, there has seen a global transfer of manufacturing into China and China's automotive industry engage in global trade. China faces unprecedented opportunities for development although there are many challenges that it must face. It has become a strategic choice for all automotive enterprises to implement supply chain management, in order to achieve competitive advantages.
   At present, most research on supply chain partnerships and their competitive advantage have been carried out based on enterprises in developed countries. Very few theoretical and empirical studies have been based on developing countries, and in particular only a few scholars have examined supply chain partnerships in China (Yeung et al., 2009).

AB In recent years, growing environmental awareness of consumers, increase the demand for green products. Restaurants see the need to improve their green performance to achieve competitive advantage and sustainability goals. However, Restaurants' environmental performance not only stems from their internal green practices, but also depends on the cooperation among supply chain members. Thus, this study proposed a cost-sharing contract to coordinate a green supply chain (GSC) between a restaurant and a supplier through developing a Stackelberg game model. Two kinds of uncertainties are considered in this model, namely, the green level of products by restaurants and the supplier's green level of materials. The research results show that a cost-sharing contract can increase profit for the whole GSC and successfully coordinate the restaurant supply chain.

TI Challenges in supply chain redesign for the Circular Economy: a
   literature review and a multiple case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Despite companies face several challenges when redesigning their supply chain for the Circular Economy, the literature lacks a systematisation of such challenges and of the ways to overcome them. Through a systematic literature review, this paper identifies and systematises 24 challenges that may hamper a supply chain redesign for the Circular Economy. Sixteen among these challenges are well known from research in related topics. On the contrary, the remaining eight are relatively new or take a different relevance within the Circular Economy context. A multiple case study in the household appliance supply chain is carried out, to explore how these challenges appear in practice and how companies may tackle them. The cases analysed involve actors at different supply chain levels, and findings suggest that a great degree of vertical integration by one actor in the supply chain is not a necessary condition for Circular Economy implementation. The empirical study, in conjunction with the literature analysis, leads to the development of a framework linking the challenges to specific levers that companies may pursue to overcome them. The framework can be seen as a reference for managers undertaking the path towards Circular Economy.

TI Social Sustainability in Apparel Supply Chains-The Role of the Sourcing
   Intermediary in a Developing Country
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB After considering significant literature on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), it is evident that research has neglected the social dimension and still lacks in highlighting the role of sourcing intermediaries in supply chains. The apparel supply chain has increased enormously in length and complexity, driving apparel retailers to employ sourcing intermediaries who manage their sourcing activities with suppliers from developing countries overseas. Thus, the purpose of this study is to enrich existing findings on SSCM by exploring the management of social sustainability when sourcing intermediaries are in between the focal company and the respective developing country factories. More specifically, this study aims to understand the role of apparel sourcing intermediaries for the implementation of social management strategies based on the perception of multiple supply chain actors. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews conducted in Vietnam and Europe. Ultimately ten propositions are presented, all explicitly concentrating on the apparel intermediary's role as a significant enabler for social sustainability in apparel supply chains. The roles are social sustainability, supplier developer and coordinator, gatekeeper and safeguard, cultural broker, and social risk manager. The social sustainability roles assumed by the apparel sourcing intermediary offer great opportunities to both apparel retailers and developing country factories.

AB Traditional food supply chains are often centralised and global in nature. Moreover they require a large amount of resource which is an issue in a time with increasing need for more sustainable food supply chains. A solution is to use localised food supply chains, an option theorised to be more sustainable, yet not proven. Therefore, this paper compares the two systems to investigate which one is more environmentally friendly, cost efficient and resilient to disruption risks. This comparison between the two types of supply chains, is performed using MILP models for an ice cream supply chain for the whole of England over the period of a year. The results obtained from the models show that the localised model performs best environmentally and economically, whilst the traditional, centralised supply chain performs best for resilience.

TI Assessing the Performance-based Logistics Service Model for Taiwan's
   Heavy Vehicle Supply Chains
SO TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL
AB This article investigates the performance-based logistics (PBL) theory and explores the potential of introducing the PBL service model to Taiwan's heavy vehicle supply chains. A multiple case study approach is used to explore this research question. Four case firms are selected for this study. The analyses have identified several major risks and influencing factors that hinder the application of the PBL model to Taiwan's heavy vehicle supply chains. However, with PBL's strength to bring sustainability benefits, an extended assessment analysis of the risks and influencing factors is conducted, and the counter-risk strategies are explored. This study has shown there is a high opportunity for PBL development in Taiwan if the obstacles can be dealt collaboratively in the heavy vehicle supply chains. The research findings provide valuable insights into Taiwan's heavy vehicle supply chains and similar emerging Asian economies relying mainly on international heavy vehicle suppliers.

AB In recent years, there have been many problems in information integration among key pharmaceutical supply chain players in Saudi Arabia. This issue has resulted in problems such as medication shortage, lack of coordination among healthcare stakeholders, product wastage, and lack of demand information. However, blockchain, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability, and security, is showing promise for easing some supply chain management problems. Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and promote supply chain sustainability. This study aims to explore the impact of blockchain technology implementation on the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The objectives of this study are to identify the current information system infrastructure in the pharmaceutical supply chain of Saudi Arabia; to examine the barriers and challenges of blockchain adoption; and to examine the barriers and challenges of blockchain implementation. The result of this research is expected to contribute to the explore the role of blockchain in sustainability efforts. In addition, it will help managers, practitioners, consultants and decision makers who are interested in a deeper understanding of blockchain and its implementation and will evaluate its influence on sustainable supply chain management.

TI Critical influencing factors of supply chain management for modular
   integrated construction
SO AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB Modular integrated construction (MiC) is evoking interest as a sustainable construction method leading towards industry 4.0. However, its complex supply chain and fragile logistic operations impede project performance. This paper, therefore, explores the critical influencing factors of MiC supply chain operations and studies their in-terrelationships. A systematic review is conducted across multiple supply chain research domains to identify relevant factors. These factors are evaluated using eigenvector and MICMAC analysis. Four themes of critical factors are determined using factor's interrelationships: dominating, symbiotic, external, and potential influ-encing factors. These themes demonstrate the influencing nature and mechanism of factors. As a result, most of the assembling-related factors are found to dominate and dynamically control the MiC supply chain performance. This paper also highlights potential factors that need further research attention, studies prevalent factors affecting the MiC supply chain and offers future research directions.

AB Around the world, consumers and retailers of fresh produce are becoming more and more discerning about factors such as food safety and traceability, health, convenience and the sustainability of production systems, and in doing so they are changing the way in which fresh produce supply chains are configured and managed. When consumers demand fresh, safe, convenient, value-for-money produce, retailers in an increasingly competitive environment are attracted to those business models most capable of meeting these demands profitably. Traditional models are proving less and less able to deliver competitive advantage in such an environment. As a result, opportunistic, adversarial, price-based approaches to doing business between chain members are being replaced by approaches that are more strategic, collaborative and value-based. The shaping force behind this change is the need for producers, wholesalers, category managers, retailers and consumers to have more certainty about the performance of the supply chains upon which they rely. Certainty is generated through the supply chain's ability to create, deliver and share value. How to build supply chains that create, deliver and share value is arguably the single biggest challenge to the competitiveness of fresh produce firms, and therefore to the industries to which they belong.

SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The monitored performance of the first new London dwelling certified to the Passive House standard is presented. The first detailed analysis of the energy consumption of the heating, ventilation and domestic hot water systems are given. The annual space heating demand of the 2 bedroom, 101 m(2) dwelling was 12.1 kWh/m(2), achieving the 15 kWh/m(2) Passive House target. The annual primary energy demand was 125 kWh/m(2), marginally above the 120 kWh/m(2) target. The measured internal heat gains of 3.65 W/m(2) are much greater than the 2.1 W/m(2) suggested as standard for dwellings. The Passive House Planning Package, PHPP, is found to be a good predictor of space heating demand and the risk of summer time over heating. Winter space heating demand is sensitive to occupant blind use. With a total metered energy consumption of 65 kWh/m(2), the Camden Passive House is one of the lowest energy, small family dwellings, monitored in the UK. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A practical method to measure sustainability performance of supply
   chains with incomplete information
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Measuring and managing supply chain sustainability is essential for achieving sustainable development goals. Existing methods fail to assess all three sustainability aspects across supply chain partners when measuring sustainability performance. Hence, this paper aims to develop a new method that evaluates environmental, social, and economic sustainability aspects across the entire supply chain, from raw material providers to consumers to reverse logistics providers. By combining content analysis, expert's evaluation, fuzzy Shannon's Entropy, and fuzzy TOPSIS, we develop a novel approach to measure the end-to-end supply chain sustainability performance. Utilizing data from six sustainability reports published by large pharmaceutical companies we demonstrate the practicality and ease of application of the proposed solution. Results show that the developed method can be used by managers and policymakers to benchmark supply chains and evaluate the effectiveness of adopted sustainable supply chain initiatives. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the results obtained from the proposed method are promising and robust. Researchers and practitioners can use the proposed approach to measure sustainability, increase their value chain transparency, and identify potential environmental and social issues across their supply chains, leading to more informed decision-making about the implementation of sustainability practices across inter-organizational processes.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Managing a tourism supply chain is predominantly focused on managing a tourism-specific product that can be perceived as all kinds of goods and services utilized by tourists during their trips. The predominant goal of this article is to empirically identify the level of engagement of entities operating in the tourism-oriented branch of industry concerning the satisfaction of end-customers with the offered tourism-related services and products. Within the scope of this study, the statistical relevance of elements of active cooperation within a tourism-specific supply chain was analyzed. Empirical examinations covered the assessment of the cooperation within the framework of the tourism-oriented supply chain and its impact on consumer satisfaction. A research questionnaire was utilized to meet examination-specific goals. Theoretical considerations and the analysis of branches of industry in relation to the available statistical data showed that tourist-oriented supply chain covers various entities, the engagement of which may have a factual impact on the efficiency of managing the entire chain, as well as on the overall client satisfaction, improving tourism sustainability. The obtained results clearly showed that the examined entities considered the analyzed cooperation aspects to be very important with regard to the supply chain management. Said aspects included the total length of cooperation within the framework of a particular supply chain, which, according to the examined entities, directly translated into the quality of cooperation-to either significant or very significant extent, as well as making it much easier to solve certain problems that were strictly connected with the provision of tourism-oriented services. Yet another aspect of cooperation that was touched upon was the transfer of the so-called know-how between the entities engaged in a given supply chain. As proven by the examination, 70% of the surveyed entities claimed that it was of significant or very significant importance. The last analyzed aspect of cooperation were relations between the supply chain-specific partners and their impact on the satisfaction of end customers. According to over half of the sample (61.54%), decent relations between supply chain participants affected the satisfaction of end customers to a notable extent.

AB Nowadays, the research community focuses on sustainability studies that are at the severe phase in the transformation towards a sustainable world. In addition, reducing the human impact on the environment requires a shift from traditional energy to renewables, which have increased significantly during recent decades as sustainable energy sources. Hence, this study assesses renewable energy sources and their related production phases from a supply chain management perception, screening and reviewing the integration between the supply chain management within the area of energy production focusing on renewable energy resources. The study executes a systematic review of English literature published on international scientific databases, focusing on the previous decade 2010-2020, to congregate the recently updated knowledge related to such research area. Thus, this study provides an authentic review of the literature that points to the relationship between supply chain operations and the area of renewable energy manufacturing from another side. Several literature reviews have been available concentrating on particular areas of managing renewable energy supply chains; however, no review has highlighted the practices of supply chain processes in energy production, focusing on renewables. The searching process relies on the published works that focus on such an area to be analyzed and characterized based on different methodologies they propose; thus, prospective and future research interests are delineated.

AB Companies' sustainable sourcing practices play an increasing role in addressing the social and environmental challenges in agricultural supply chains. Yet the approaches companies take to regulate their supply chains continue to evolve. I use the chocolate industry as a critical case to explore how and why companies have changed their approaches to sustainable cocoa sourcing over the last 20 years. Drawing on an analysis of 205 company documents, 95 newspaper articles and over 50 in-depth interviews, I trace the evolution of chocolate manufacturers' sustainable sourcing practices from a focus on industry initiatives to a commitment to sustainability certification and now to companies increasingly moving toward own-supply chain programs. These shifts can in part be explained by the evolving salience of different stakeholder groups over time. This study highlights the dynamic nature of sustainable sourcing practice adoption and suggests companies are building upon previous strategies to incorporate more stakeholder voices over time.

The Passive House standard (Passivhaus in German) is one of the world's most aggressive, proven, voluntary approaches to radical energy reduction, assured indoor air quality, durability, and thermal comfort in the world today. The Passive House standard has roots in Sweden, Germany, Canada and the US. While much of the approach to good, low-energy and passive design is well known, it is still seldom practiced. This paper will introduce and explore the Passive House standard design approach and requirements as well as demonstrate its application to new and retrofit projects in the North American context. Drawing from expertise on the early Passive House projects in the US and Germany, as well as on the ground experience of more recent successful and unsuccessful Passive House projects in North America, a journey toward the best practices in design application, cost and certification will be discussed. A brief review of the various products and systems incorporated in North American projects to meet the aggressive requirements of the passive house standard will also be introduced.

There are many overlaps between the service provided by container liners and freight forwarders, which may affect their relationships. However, there is a lack of research on this issue. This study attempts to analyze the basis for cooperation, the causes of conflict, and the means to achieve sustainable relationships in the supply chain. It is based on container liners' strategy to extend end-to-end service and improve layout through acquisition and investment. The study fills the gap in the current literature on the relationship between container liners and freight forwarders. It is also one of the few studies to apply game theory to coopetition in the shipping industry. The results have practical significance in terms of learning how to improve cooperation in the supply chain.

SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB In today's global marketplace, no pharmaceutical supply chain is immune to the risk of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Preventing the infiltration of counterfeit pharmaceuticals into the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chains is an important issue of public health debate. It is an important public health issue because of patient welfare and expanding healthcare costs. As a result, pharmaceutical firms are under intense media and public scrutiny to secure their supply chains. Mitigating risk of counterfeit and compromised pharmaceuticals demands pharmaceutical supply chains that are secured and resilient. Although counterfeit and compromised pharmaceuticals are found in both developing and developed countries, they are more prevalent in Nigeria. To reverse this trend and close the weak links in the supply chains of legitimate pharmaceuticals requires developing effective partnerships and multilayered measures. Indeed, safeguarding the integrity of pharmaceuticals and their distribution is not only a matter of brand equity and corporate reputation protection, but also a matter of life and death.

TI Supply network design to address United Nations Sustainable Development
   Goals: A case study of blockchain implementation in Thai fish industry
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Sustainable Development Goals present an opportunity for industries to (re)design their supply chains. It is understood that digital technologies like blockchain can be helpful in achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals linked to livelihoods, food security, and the environment, by identifying issues and implementing interventions in real-time. However, there is limited understanding over data structure requirements for blockchain technology implementation in digitally-enabled food supply chains. Therefore, this research studies the design of blockchain-centric food supply chains that promote Sustainable Development Goals, within the context of the Thai fish industry. Key findings suggest that data asymmetry exists in supply chains to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. This research presents four design principles and an integrated technology implementation framework, derived from empirical data, for blockchain-centric food supply chains. The research outcome contributes to the supply chain management field and could ultimately impact the resilience of fishery ecosystems and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.

TI EFFECT OF SUPPLY CHAIN LEARNING ON FLEXIBILITY PERFORMANCE: AN EMPIRICAL
   STUDY
SO INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION
AB Today's intensely competitive business is undergoing significant shifts, which render it a challenging environment to compete in. Production processes are evolving as customer demands change, which leads to greater variability. Firms must respond to changing environmental conditions to remain sustainable. Companies today look for ways to overcome their problems not only on their own but also with their supply chains. Reduced cost and improved performance are two significant benefits of supply chain management. Because companies can work together in the face of challenging market conditions throughout their supply chains, it makes sense for them to collaborate. When companies work together, they can collaborate to produce better-designed products and more efficient manufacturing processes. Learning, supply chain integration, and flexibility throughout the supply chain are critical to successful supply chain management.
   In this study, the effect of supply chain learning on supply chain integration and production flexibility has been investigated. The mediating role of supply chain integration on the impact of supply-chain learning on production flexibility has been tested. For this purpose, survey data was collected from the 144 companies selected out of Turkey's largest exporting companies. The data were analyzed via structural equation modeling and process macro methods. As a result of the structural equation model analysis, it was found that supply chain learning significantly affects the chain's integration and its production flexibility. As a result of the intermediation test, it was determined that the integration of the supply chain has a vital intermediary role regarding the effect of supply chain learning on the flexibility of production.

TI A Multi-Objective Optimization Model for Green Supply Chain Considering
   Environmental Benefits
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Whether the upstream and downstream members in a supply chain (considering environmental objectives) simultaneously stabilize economic benefits has become an important problem in the process of green development. However, few quantitative studies on green supply chains have considered environmental and economic benefits to realize multi-objective optimization. To study operation and cooperation strategies with a consideration of the different objective on the level of supply chain, we first establish a green supply chain game model with profit and environment objectives simultaneously considered by the manufacturer. Then, we analyze the multi-objective decisions of the supply chain members under centralized control using a manufacturer-led Stackelberg game and revenue-sharing contract. Using the manufacturer's environmental preference as a variable, the effects of environmental benefits on the supply chain are also investigated. Finally, this study determines that the manufacturer's profit will be reduced after considering the objective of environmental benefits, while the retailer's profit, product greenness, and environmental benefits will be improved. Meanwhile, the total profit of the green supply chain will first increase and then decrease. In particular, a revenue-sharing contract can facilitate the coordination of multiple objectives; in this way, both the manufacturer and the retailer achieve higher profits and environmental benefits compared to a decentralized control condition, which is of great significance in achieving a win-win situation for the economy and the environment.

TI Sustainability in the Supply Chain: Analyzing the Role of the Focal
   Company and Training in the Implementation of SDGs
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Understanding how training can contribute to employee awareness, development of skills, competencies, and knowledge of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in supply chains and the role of the focal company still remains unanswered. Thus, this article had the purpose of investigating the performance of a company in the Brazilian electricity sector in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the supply chain. A review of the literature on the SDGs and the importance of focal companies and training for their execution was carried out in order to theoretically support the study. Then, the case study technique was used to understand "how" and "which" training practices are being implemented in the supply chain to make the management of the SDGs more effective. The results indicate: (i) that the systematic application of training by the focal company is crucial for the implementation of SDGs in the supply chain, (ii) that the focal company plays an important role in leading the implementation of the SDGs in the supply chain, and (iii) that the partnerships between supply chain members are important and facilitate sustainable management in the supply chains. Additionally, we present a robust set of training practices conducted in the supply chain and the results achieved.

TI Application of Circular Economy and Uncertainty Planning in Analyzing
   the Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Supply chain sustainability as a new and very effective approach has recently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of supply chain management. Also, a circular economy helps to reduce the waste materials and products in a supply chain. In order to include circular economy in supply chain network design, it is necessary to use the concept of closed-loop network design. Therefore, designing a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that works well even by changing some parameters seems to be necessary. This paper presents a multiproduct, sustainable closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty. First, a mathematical model is proposed to design a closed-loop network, and then a set of possible scenarios is used to deal with the uncertainty of the parameters. In order to show the validity and applicability of the proposed model, numerical examples are presented and analyzed. In this regard, numerical results show the appropriate performance of the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the role of customer demand in different aspects of sustainability. It is revealed that increasing customer demand will have a strong impact on economic and environmental objectives.

SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Research shows that supply chain finance (SCF) is an efficient set of methods for reducing financing costs and improving financing efficiency. This paper studies how newly introduced sustainability-focused SCF programs can promote both sustainable development and supply chain sustainability for firms in Vietnam. Given the scarcity of research on SCF and supply chain sustainability in Vietnam, this study adopts the multiple case methodology based on six supply chain buyers which have introduced sustainability-focused SCF programs in Vietnam. Data were collected from 32 in-depth interviews with supply chain managers and business leaders in six case firms. By comparing empirical findings through cross-case analyses, the number of drivers, barriers, and current propositions regarding sustainability practices of companies that employ sustainability-oriented SCF programs in Vietnam are investigated. Our research delivers valuable practical implications by highlighting key designed concepts of the newly introduced sustainability-oriented SCF programs in Vietnam. It also contributes to supply chain sustainability literature by addressing a number of propositions regarding the engagement in sustainability-oriented SCF programs and the development of supply chain sustainability in Vietnam.

TI Supply chain sustainability during turbulent environment: Examining the
   role of firm capabilities and government regulation
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB The turbulent environment like COVID-19 has forced many firms to the brink of collapse. It has a devastating impact on the supply chain management and its sustainability. Many firms were forced to close due to unavailability of raw materials, essential ingredients, and labor shortage. Not many firms were capable of efficiently handling such disruptive situation. There is not much study on appropriate supply chain strategy for such turbulent situation. The practitioners as well as academic researchers are interested to know how to deal with such situation and remain sustainable for any such future crisis like COVID-19. In this background the aim of this study is to examine the determinants that impact the supply chain sustainability during turbulent situation. The study investigates how firm capability and government regulation impact the supply chain sustainability during turbulent environment. With the help of literature review, dynamic capability theory and contingency theory, a theoretical model has been developed. Later the model has been validated using PLS-SEM technique with 315 usable responses from employees of different firms in India engaged in supply chain management process. The study finds out that firms' capabilities, leadership team support and contingency plan play vital role to formulate appropriate supply chain strategy which in turn positively impacts supply chain sustainability during turbulent environment. The study also finds that there is a moderating role of government regulation impacting supply chain management during the turbulent environment.

AB There is a growing need to integrate environmental considerations into supply chain management research and practice. Conceptual papers are being updated all the time to gain a systematic view of the framework in green supply chain management. The purpose of this paper is to visualize the research to-date on green supply chain management according to the intellectual framework and hot topics. Using bibliometric analysis, our paper will present a comprehensive summary of previous research on the knowledge domain. Exploring 1145 papers mainly published from 2000 to May 2017 in international peer-reviewed journals from social sciences citation index (SSCI), the basic distribution of publications are analyzed, and nine prominent research clusters in green supply chain management are visualized by a co-citation network. Key issues are highlighted and analyzed. As for future inquiries, there are numerous opportunities for more advanced theoretically-grounded research and exploration of more multi-functional and systematic approaches. In order to gain broader views of research, a triple bottom line approach can be widely applied to evaluation, impact mechanisms, decision making, drivers, risks and carrier analysis, as well as system contributions. This also provides an integrated point of view to understand the landscape of green supply chain management both for researchers and practitioners.

At the same time, circular economies push the boundaries of environmental sustainability by highlighting the notion of innovative goods, creating a viable relationship between ecosystems and economic growth. Through a systematic literature review, this paper identifies four themes-drivers, barriers, practices, and indicators of sustainable performance when applying a circular economy in the textile and apparel industry. We establish a conceptual model based on these four themes, which illustrates the relationship between them. We highlight challenges in circular economy implementation and provide some suggestions for managers in the textile and apparel industry. We conclude by suggesting several future research directions.

TI Comparative study between the Passive House Standard in warm climates
   and Nearly Zero Energy Buildings under Spanish Technical Building Code
   in a dwelling design in Seville, Spain
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The Passive House Standard is based on the reduction of energy demand and consumption. In Spain, this Passive House concept has become the preferred alternative for achieving nearly Zero Energy Buildings. The necessary criteria were incorporated into Spain's 2019 Technical Building Code, which considers the passive design of buildings. In fact, it is possible that the design of many Spanish buildings complying with the basic criteria of passive architecture and the current regulatory framework, meet the require-ments of the Passive House. On the other hand, the adaptation of the standard to different climates is very general and wide-ranging. The inflexibility of certain criteria brings into question the effectiveness of the certification in warm climates such as in the south of Spain or Southern Europe. This study compares the application of basic Passive House standards with Spain's current building reg-ulations to achieve nZEB in a project which applies passive design strategies to a single-family dwelling in Seville, Spain. The results show that the current national regulations render unnecessary the application and/or certification of the Passive House standard as a guarantee of energy efficiency and offer a better solution in terms of building sustainability for a warm climate.

AB The stabilization of the supply chain lies on the profit distribution primarily, and most of papers study the problem from the perspective of enterprises. But it is obviously that proportions of suppliers to manufacturers are poles apart for different sorts of products, so this paper analyzes the sustainable collaboration of the supply chain based on the product's demand elasticity. Using Sprengler model, the paper puts forward the main crucial variables to sustainable collaboration. By the deduction from the mathematic model, it is concluded that the supply chain will keep stabilization only when the-profit is distributed according to a fixed ratio which is a function of the demand elastic coefficient.

TI Building supply chain resilience in the era of COVID-19: An AHP-DEMATEL
   approach
SO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB COVID-19 pandemic is the worst humanitarian crisis that economies across the globe have witnessed. Forced lockdowns, social distancing, and restricted mobility have contributed to large scale disruptions in the supply chain network. The purpose of the paper is to identify critical factors affecting global supply chain and evaluate strategies for risk reduction in the supply chain network by making it resilient. Our study incorporates multi-criteria decision approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze factors that affected the supply chain networks with the onset of COVID-19. The AHP method enabled to hierarchically rank the factors based on the relative weightage while DEMATEL ascertained the inter-relationships among the factors and classified them into cause and effect groups. The findings of our study identified the cost-optimization as the most significant factor and the human resource management as the least important factor in reducing vulnerabilities of the supply chain network. Our analysis from DEMATEL approach indicate that government support is a significant causal factor which can effectively eliminate the issues plaguing supply chains during this pandemic. The results from our study aim to help policymakers in developing a risk resilient framework that can enhance performance and operational capability of the supply chain, thereby ensuring sustainability and socio-economic well-being of all the stakeholders involved in the entire network.

TI Extending the efficient and responsive supply chains framework to the
   green context
SO BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop research frameworks for two types of green supply chains based on Fisher's seminal work. In spite of Fisher's contribution to the literature, his study has rarely been extended into green supply chain contexts, except in a fewconceptual arguments. The current study explores how Fisher's perspective of efficient versus responsive supply chains can be a stepping stone to the development of two green supply chains: eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - Toward the above end, a case methodology is employed (Yin). Two Korean global companies, Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO) and Samsung Electronics (SEC), are selected to explore eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains. POSCO (steel products) is selected to enable the understanding of how efficient and eco-efficient supply chains work. SEC (mobile phone products) is chosen to understand responsive and eco-responsive supply chains.
   Findings - The findings suggest that POSCO tends to stress process technology innovation as a means to address green pressures, while SEC accentuates the green product strategy; while an eco-efficient supply chain focuses on keeping to an environmental standard across the supply chains, an eco-responsive supply chain centers on the collaboration of suppliers and distributors in greening the supply chain; and SEC takes more initiatives to educate and encourage consumers to engage in recycling activities than POSCO does.
   Originality/value - Few studies have examined the green supply chain using the perspective of Fisher's framework (efficient vs responsive supply chains). By addressing the timely topic, this study fills a research gap in green supply chain literature.

AB Hydrogen technology and passive house represent two concepts with a remarkable role for the efficiency and decarbonisation of energy systems in the residential buildings area. Through design and functionality, the passive house can make maximum use of all available energy resources. One of the solutions to supply energy of these types of buildings is the fuel cell, using this technology integrated into a system for generating electricity from renewable primary sources, which take the function of backup power (energy reserve) to cover peak load and meteorological intermittents. In this paper is presented the results of the case study that provide an analysis of the energy, environmental and financial performances regarding energy supply of passive house by power generation systems with fuel cell fed with electrolytic hydrogen produced by harnessing renewable energy sources available. Hybrid systems have been configured and operate in various conditions of use for five differentiated locations according to the main areas of solar irradiation from the Romanian map. Global performance of hybrid systems is directly influenced by the availability of renewable primary energy sources -particular geo-climatic characteristics of the building emplacement.

TI Assessing the Cost Impact of Multiple Transportation Modes to Enhance
   Sustainability in an Integrated, Two Stage, Automotive Supply Chain
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB As the automotive industry has been striving to enhance its efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainability, great focus is often placed on opportunities for improving its supply chain operations. We study the effect of introducing multiple modes of transportation in an industry-motivated production and transportation problem involving short-term automotive supply chain planning. We consider multiple, heterogeneous modes of transportation that offer a cost vs. delivery time option to the manufacturer. Having multiple modes of transportation in the system promotes supply chain sustainability. We present an integer linear programming model that captures the availability of multiple transportation modes. We then provide a solution approach based on a hybrid simulated annealing algorithm that we use to analyze the problem. Experimental results demonstrate the impact of additional transportation mode lead times compared to costs in the integrated supply chain.

TI Determinants of the transition towards circular economy in SMEs: A
   sustainable supply chain management perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB This paper develops a model to explore the relationships between social pressure, environmental commitment, green economic incentives, supply chain relationship management, sustainable supply chain design, and circular economy capability. Through data gathered from 212 small and medium enterprises (SMEs), this study applies confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the model developed. The findings provide three main contributions to the body of literature. First, they confirm that environmental commitment and green economic incentives have a significant positive impact on supply chain relationship management and sustainable supply chain design. Second, they highlight the role of supply chain relationship management and sustainable supply chain design to improve the circular economy capabilities of SMEs. Third, they show a positive effect of social pressure on environmental commitment and green economic incentives. These results induce practitioners, academicians, and policy makers to design strategic plans to encourage circular economy transition of SMEs and supply chains, as well as to focus their attention on the role of sustain ability in supply chain management domain.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Adopting digital technologies in a business can help with sustainable supply chain management. These technologies can make e-commerce development faster and empower the emergence of B2B e-commerce businesses. In this study, our focus was to develop a framework for an Internet of things (IoT) embedded sustainable supply chain to deliver textile items using a B2B e-commerce business model. We formulated a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to minimize the total supply chain cost, including the B2B orders' packaging, handling, and transportation, with carbon emission taxation. Furthermore, the purchasing cost of the RFID tags and IoT facilities that were provided on the transport vehicles was high. The proposed model was solved by using the global solver in the LINGO software package and finding the optimized value of the total supply chain network cost. We tested the proposed model in different case scenarios, i.e., small- to significant-sized problems. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the variations in the overall cost of the supply chain network when there were changes in the main parameters of the proposed model. The results of the models showed that models can be helpful for efficient logistics planning and supply chain design.

TI Key factors of carbon footprint in the UK food supply chains: a new
   perspective of life cycle assessment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically identify key factors of UK food supply chains (SCs) that significantly contribute to CO(2)emissions (CO2e) taking into account the life cycle assessment (LCA). The UK food supply chain includes imports from other countries. Design/methodology/approach This research develops a conceptual framework from extant literature. Secondary data obtained from ONS and FAOSTAT covering from 1990 to 2014 are analysed using Multilinear Regression (MLR) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to identify the factors relating to CO(2)emissions significance, and the efficient contributions that are being made to their reduction in the UK food supply chains. Findings The study results suggest that Transportation and Sales/Distribution are the two key factors of CO(2)emissions in UK food supply chains. This is confirmed by two multivariate methods, MLR and SFA. MLR results show that transportation increases UK CO(2)emissions by 10 tonnes of CO(2)emissions from one tonne of fruits and vegetables imports from overseas to the UK Sales and Distribution reduces the UK CO(2)emissions by 1.3 tonnes of CO(2)emissions due to improved, technological operation activities in the UK. In addition, the SFA results confirm that the key factors are sufficient to predict an increase or decrease in CO(2)emissions in the UK food supply chains. Research limitations/implications This study has focused on the LCA of the UK food supply chain from limited data. Future studies should consider Sustainability Impact Assessment of the UK food supply chain, identifying the social, economic, regulatory and environmental impacts of the food supply chain using a re-defined LCA (all-inclusive assessment) tool. Practical implications This research suggests that food supply chain professionals should improve efficiency, e.g. the use of solar energy and biogas, and also integrate low-carbon policies and practices in food supply chain operations. Furthermore, governments should encourage policies such as mobility management programmes, urban redevelopment and privatisation to enhance better transportation systems and infrastructure to continuously reduce CO(2)e from the food trade. Originality/value Although logistics play a major role in CO(2)emissions, all logistics CO(2)emissions for other countries are not included in the ONS data. This research reveals some important insights into the UK food supply chains. Logistics and other food supply chain processes of importing countries significantly contribute to CO(2)emissions which are yet to be considered in the UK food SCs.

TI A life-cycle cost analysis of the passive house "POLITEHNICA" from
   Bucharest
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB The objective of this article is to create a mathematical model based on the analysis of the life-cycle cost of a passive house, including its technical design variations. In this study, we analyzed 14 types of houses derived from the design of the passive house POLITEHNICA; every house was differentiated by the type of renewable solution used (EAHX, GHP, solar collectors, PV panels) or by the insulation thickness, and it was compared with H12, a standard house with classical HVAC systems and a thermal insulation of 100 mm. The houses were compared according to criteria of economic performance throughout their life cycle. It was found that the additional investment in an energy efficient house can be recovered in 16-26 years, 9-16 years and 16-28 years if the replaced HVAC system is classical gas fuelled, electric or district distribution. A sensitivity analysis is performed which revealed the influence of the price of electricity and PV panels. The classification system made the decision-making process easier for a possible investment in a solution. This classification system showed that the first three recommended solutions for investment are the houses H14, H17 and H20. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Organizational enablers for circular economy in the context of
   sustainable supply chain management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The paradigms of sustainability and circular economy have represented separate streams of academic literature but there is a growing realization that these two paradigms may have a mutually-constitutive relationship. Particularly, the relationship among the two notions in the context of supply chains remains unexplored and this is the focus of this research. We draw on the organizational sense making literature to identify the organizational enablers of circular supply chains and their relationships with the environmental performance of supply chains. Data was collected from various supply chains within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was adopted to test the hypothesis derived from a systematic review of the literature.
   Originality of this work stems from the conceptualisation and validation of a framework for circular supply chains and sustainable performance as a combination of process facilitators and a persuasive organizational narrative that enables organizations to embrace the circular economy practices. The validated framework has implications for both academia and the industry because of its emphasis on the joint effects of a) the discursive ability of organizational actors to articulate a paradigm shift towards circular supply chains b) the process facilitators comprising of actions and practices that enable circular supply chains.

   A long time pharmaceutical manufacturers designed their supply chains with regard to two major objectives: supply availability and supply reliability. In line with an increasing cost awareness and varying market characteristics this changes more and more. Besides supply availability and supply reliability, cost efficiency and the ability to respond become increasingly important. Within a study among seven global players from the pharmaceutical industry, the BWI Center for Industrial Management of ETH Zurich (Switzerland) was able to analyze to what extent this development already affects current supply chain structures and processes. Moreover, the study indicates the future measures that supply chain managers foresee in order to improve cost efficiency and responsiveness.

TI Investigation of Disruption Management Practices and Environmental
   Impact on Malaysian Automotive Supply Chains: A Case Study Approach
SO JURNAL KEJURUTERAAN
AB Much focus on managing a supply chain in the event of disruption has been on the financial consequences and the service level impact on the customers. The negative impact caused by the disruption could influence a company's profit and market share. Nonetheless, the importance of the environmental impact consideration in the supply chain disruption management has not been emphasised in the existing literature despite research findings that highlight the impact of some resilient supply chain practices on its environmental sustainability. This paper aims to assess the relationship between supply chain mitigation and recovery practices and its environmental impact. To achieve this objective, a case study was employed where semi-structured interviews were conducted at selected automotive companies in Malaysia. The results show that most disruption mitigation and recovery practices of a supply chain have a medium impact on its environmental performance. In particular, the production process during supply disruption recovery has the highest influence on environmental performance in the form of waste generation and use of energy. The results of this study can be used by supply chain managers to focus their efforts in the right direction in order to achieve cost objectives, service levels and environmental goals during the management of disruptions.

TI Circular Business Processes in the State-of-the-Practice: A Survey Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite increasing global environmental concerns, we continue to consume large amounts of products with little regard to what happens before, during, and after their use. Roughly one-third of the food produced is wasted. Because the world's population is expected to grow to 10 billion by 2050, adopting circular economy practices will become essential. The transition towards a circular economy requires adopting business processes that support circular economy practices across supply chains. Currently, the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model is the most widely used, and widely known, approach for studying and evaluating supply chain business processes. It is, however, unclear to what extent circular principles are included in the SCOR model. Past studies indicating missing processes for circular supply chain management in the SCOR model have made limited efforts in capturing the current state-of-the-practice. We conducted an online survey of 60 companies engaged in 14 different types of economic activities to study the SCOR level 2 business processes adopted in practice. In addition to the 22 level 2 business processes documented in SCOR, we identified six additional level 2 circular business processes that the respondents recognized as being commonly applied within their businesses. The results clearly show that the current SCOR model does not fully represent circular business processes in the state-of-the-practice.

TI Minimizing losses in milk supply chain with sustainability: An example
   from an emerging economy
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Food loss in supply chain is a growing problem due to its environmental, social and economic impacts. Especially in emerging economies losses mostly occur in the first stages of the supply chain including agricultural production and postharvest storage. As an emerging economy, Turkey, also suffers from the food losses in the supply chain. In this study, focus is on raw milk losses in the supply chain since livestock and diary sectors are one of the most important sectors in Turkey's economy. Aim of this study is firstly, to investigate root causes of raw milk losses in the supply chain and to predict potential raw milk losses. Secondly, presenting a sustainable solution according to the results of the prediction and finally achieving environmental, social and economic benefits for sustainable raw milk supply chain. Grey Method is used to predict potential losses between 2017-2019 and at the end of the study, triple bottom line based sustainable collection center model is suggested for policymakers.

TI Supply chain resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged supply chains more seriously challenged than ever before. During this prolonged global health crisis, supply chain managers were forced to rely primarily on solutions developed for limited and foreseeable crises. This study aimed to understand how well existing solutions facilitated supply chain resilience in the UK perishable goods market. Consistent with this aim, we developed a research model based on the supply chain resilience literature and tested it with covariance-based structural equation modelling. Data were collected from 282 retail employees. Supply chain velocity was the preferred measure of resilience. The findings demonstrate that pandemic-related disruptions have affected resilience-building activities. While both proactive and reactive approaches have promoted resilience building during the pandemic, they have not been sufficient to ameliorate all the pandemic's negative effects. Innovation featured as the most effective factor, followed by robustness, empowerment, and risk management via reduced risk. The effect of firm size was sig-nificant only on supply chain risk management, with larger companies more efficiently applying risk manage-ment practices. The results emphasise the importance of innovation for supply chain resilience. Regardless of firm size, innovation works for every company. Empowerment is another costless and effective tool. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that innovation and empowerment can help organisations to manage their supply chains effectively during crises. Companies can strengthen their supply chain resilience by developing strong re-lationships with their supplier and employees.

   chain? A game-theoretical modelling study
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB Currently, water-saving service (WSS) providers are devoted to providing high-water-consumption (HWC) supply chains with comprehensive water-saving solutions. In this context, the decentralized and cooperative decision models for HWC supply chain under the benchmark scenario without WSS, and the decentralized, hybrid and cooperative decision models for the three-tier WSS supply chain under the scenario with WSS are developed and analyzed, the corresponding numerical and sensitivity analyses for all models are conducted and compared, and finally, the managerial insights are summarized. The research results indicate that: (1) introducing WSS could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus for the HWC supply chain; (2) a cooperative strategy could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus and is the best strategy for the three-tier WSS supply chain; (3) the hybrid strategy (partial cooperative strategy) could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus and is the second-best strategy for the three-tier WSS supply chain; (4) reducing the costs of water saving could effectively enhance water consumption reduction, increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus for the three-tier WSS supply chain.

TI A two-stage stochastic programming model for value-based supply chain
   network design
SO SCIENTIA IRANICA
AB Nowadays, Value-based Supply Chain Management (VbSCM) is considered a resource of competitive advantages, and companies with long term strategic plans find the VbSCM an effective factor in sustainability. In this context, supply chain network design has a significant impact on all value drivers (i.e. sales, supply chain costs, fixed assets and working capital). This paper proposes a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model for a value-based supply chain network design in which decisions on physical flow (raw materials and finished products) and financial flow are integrated. The proposed model is designed for a four-echelon, multi-commodity, multi-period supply chain, and it maximizes the value of the company, based on the economic value-added concept, by making some strategic and tactical decisions affecting the value drivers. Furthermore, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming model is developed with a scenario generation method based on Nataf transformation. Also, a computational analysis is undertaken to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB The interfirm business strategy is being shifted from competition-cooperation to cooperation in economic globalization environment. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) provides an effective approach to analysis dynamic evolution of cooperation and competition in inter-organizations system. The cooperative and competitive behaviors of partners in construction supply chain are analyzed by employing EGT. The replicator dynamic models of general contractor and subcontractors (suppliers) are separately established. Two kinds of evolutionary stable strategy of dynamic game in construction supply chain system, cooperation and competition, are elicited based on the replicator dynamic models. Finally, based on the analysis of three key factors, discount coefficient, excess income and initial dedication of partners, which effect the evolutionary directions of construction supply chain system, it is reasoned out that adopting cooperative strategy is the critical success factor for keeping cooperative evolutionary direction and cooperative stability of construction supply chain system.

TI Vaccine supply chain coordination using blockchain and artificial
   intelligence technologies
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Currently, the global spread of COVID-19 is taking a heavy toll on the lives of the global population. There is an urgent need to improve and strengthen the coordination of vaccine supply chains in response to this severe pandemic. In this study, we consider a vaccine supply chain based on a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and model the supply chain as a two-player dynamic game with inventory level as the dynamic equation of the system. The study focuses on the applicability and effectiveness of the two technologies in the vaccine supply chain and provides management insights. The impact of the application of the technologies on environmental performance is also considered in the model. We also examine factors such as the number of people vaccinated, positive and side effects of vaccines, vaccine decay rate, revenue-sharing/cost-sharing ratio, and commission ratio. The results are as follows: the correlation between the difficulty in obtaining certified vaccines and the profit of a vaccine manufacturer is not monotonous; the vaccine manufacturer is more sensitive to changes in the vaccine attenuation rate. The study's major conclusions are as follows: First, the vaccine supply chain should estimate the level of consumers' difficulty in obtaining a certified vaccine source and the magnitude of the production planning and demand forecasting error terms before adopting the two technologies. Second, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is meaningful in the vaccine supply chain when the error terms satisfy a particular interval condition.

TI DESIGN OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACT UNDER TRADE CREDITS AND CARBON
   EMISSION REDUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB Most of the previous literatures proposed a single coordination contract to increase the total profit of the supply chain, while this paper focuses on how to design environmental contracts to increase economic and environmental performance in the context of sustainable development. This paper designs the environmental contract based on cap-and-trade mechanism and trade credits which has rarely been studied before, especially the impact of trade credit on environmental performance. We consider a green supply chain, assuming that the demand rate is linear with retail prices, joint carbon emission reduction efforts and trade credit. Two models, a decentralized one and a centralized one, are compared; four contracts are proposed. Via numerous examples and sensitivity analysis, we gain some insight into how to select supply chain contracts to better improve environmental performance. The results reveal that the manufacturer sharing the retailer's revenue and cost contract obtains the highest profit. While revenue sharing contract between both parties is the optimal environmental contract, but it is difficult to increase the profit of supply chain. Furthermore, it is found that trade credit works well in protecting the environment and plays a significant role in achieving coordination.

SO ILR REVIEW
AB Although firms in diverse industries increasingly adopt private regulation of labor standards for workers in their global supply chains, growing scholarly evidence suggests that this approach has not generated sustainable improvements in working conditions for those workers. The authors draw on recent developments in institutional theory regarding the development of opaque institutional fields that cause the decoupling between practices and outcomes to develop a new explanation for the lack of sustainable improvement in labor practices in supply chains. Using qualitative and quantitative data from a global apparel supplier and a global home products retailer, they demonstrate the various ways in which opacity causes decoupling between private regulation practices of global firms and outcomes for workers in supply chains.

The results showed that supply chain risk management has a significant impact on supplier integration, internal integration, and customer integration. However, only supplier integration and internal integration significantly impact supply chain performance, while the relationship between customer integration and supply chain performance is not significant. The moderation effects of supply chain social sustainability positively enhance the impact of supply chain risk management on supplier integration and customer integration, while it reduces the impact of supply chain risk management on internal integration.

TI Changes in the supply chain outcomes of food regionalization, 2007-2017:
   Broccoli in the eastern United States
SO PLOS ONE
AB Local and regional food supply chains are gaining increasing support from public and private sectors for their contributions to economic development and promoting sustainability. However, the impacts of regionalization are not well understood. We employ a spatial-temporal model of production and transportation to evaluate the supply chain outcomes of a decade-long process of food regionalization for fresh broccoli in the eastern United States (US). Our results indicate that eastern broccoli supply chains displaced products sourced from the western US and met over 15% of the annual demand in eastern markets in 2017. We find that total broccoli supply chain costs and food miles increased in the period 2007-2017. Nevertheless, eastern-grown broccoli has contributed to reducing regional food miles in the eastern region (from 365 miles in 2007 to 255 miles in 2017) and experienced only modest increases in supply chains costs (a 3.4% increase, compared to a 16.5% increase for broccoli shipped from western US) during the same period. Our results provide valuable information for policymakers and the fresh produce industry interested in promoting regional food supply chains.

TI Towards a Feminist Geo-legal Ethic of Caring Within Medical Supply
   Chains: Lessons from Careless Supply During the COVID-19 Pandemic
SO FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES
AB The COVID-19 crisis illustrates the fragility of supply chains. Countries with excellent health systems struggled to ensure essential supplies of food, medicines, and personal protective equipment which were vital to a fast and effective response. Using geo-legality, which maps the constitutive relations between law and space, we argue that the failure of supply chains in many western countries during the crisis reveals a fundamental tension between their role as facilitators of care and caring, and the logistic logics by which they operate. While supply chains link the intimate, domestic concerns of providing medical care with the globalised geographical concerns of moving goods across different jurisdictions at the right time, their contemporary organisation and regulation does not reflect the caring relations and public goods they are meant to support. Drawing on analysis of examples from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this article argues that a reconfiguration of supply chains in accordance with feminist approaches that place care at the centre of supply chain operation and organisation will be important to amendments of both domestic and global health law.

We note that many negative environmental impacts, such as waste, energy consumption, transport processes and packaging, can be avoided if companies establish closed-loop production systems. In this contribution we outline the concept of sustainable supply chain networks (SSCN) as a suitable means of designing closed-loop production systems. The implementation of SSCN allows the process links between the companies in a supply chain to close, which facilitates the transformation from a flow economy into a circular economy.

   Using Financial Performance Indicators
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The purpose of this paper is to explore which financial performance indicators (FPIs) evaluate the level of supply chain capability (SCC) that explicitly touches all of the business functions and processes within and beyond the company. The authors investigated nine FPIs that were selected from the financial statements of 155 companies within nine industries from 2011 to 2017 using Morningstar financial database and Gartner's report. The authors find that suitable FPIs to measure SCC for shareholders' value are return-on-assets (ROA), days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and current ratio (CR). This means that higher ROA, shortened DSO, and an appropriate level of CR could reach a sustainable supply chain. These results will help the industry to avert a major disruption in supply chain processes and activities using suitable financial performance indicators.

TI Designing an eco-efficient biomass-based supply chain using a
   multi-actor optimisation model
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainability concerns emphasise the importance of identifying eco-efficient supply chain configurations which balance economic and environmental chain objectives. The applied modelling approaches for this purpose often assume the availability of raw materials and full coordination within the supply chain studied. Some or all actors in the chain can however pursue individual objectives, making the obtained solutions unfeasible in practice. Economic incentives support aligning the objectives of the different supply chain actors. This paper explores the design of eco-efficient biomass supply chains and economic gain allocation between the supply chain partners. A case study is developed for the sugar beet processing chain in the Netherlands, in which farmers can also choose to produce other competing crops. We observe that higher yields often lead to lower carbon emissions per ton of produce. Hence, eco-efficient solutions are found to have production and processing locations in the most productive regions. Additionally, margin sharing above the minimum sugar beet price is necessary to ensure the production of the desired quantity of sugar beet. Realistic sugar beet prices are determined using a Shapley-value approach, leading to a fair distribution of margin among the farmers and processor in the supply chain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Up to now, all the supply chain concepts (LARG, SCM 2.0, Sustainable) have been solving the efficiency of satisfying customer wishes in the supply chain by analysing the efficiency of particular chains or its interactions. The most important practices and methodologies were integration, process management, production value added, automation, leanness, agility, resiliency etc. responding to the actual business environment. The potential of these attitudes have been almost exhausted. Thanks to the system thinking, discovered in 50's, there is the opportunity to use the new methodology, solving supply chains not only as interacting parts but as the unified whole with the one goal, KPI and methodology. This new concept supports not only doing things right but even during the right things. The whole, Whole Chain Management (WCM), could efficiently and effectively solve problems, such as partial optimizations, partial KPI's, management of separated parts instead of unified wholes, solving of the opposing goals either in one department or chain in supply chain, etc. None of them has been systematically solved yet. The new methodology could complement analytical approach by synthetic approach solving the properties of the wholes and its utilization for the management of all operational, tactical and strategic processes guaranteeing successful business results - satisfied customers.

TI Relationship between the state of the country's logistics and perishable
   goods' output: dairy industry
SO TQM JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper seeks to assess the capabilities and maturity of supply chain planning and product quality management systems implemented by the dairy industries in three different countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, and Lithuania. Design/methodology/approach Through a systematic analysis of statistical information, the descriptors of the logistics supply chain efficiency were identified. Directions for dairy supply chain management improvement were also highlighted. The study uses secondary statistics from open sources as a basis for the comparative analysis across a range of indicators, including the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), the dairy products quantity, the production volume of milk and dairy products, and other indicators characterizing the dairy industry. Findings The results of this study suggest the inconsistency and narrowness of single indexes and ranking, which are traditionally used to evaluate the logistics system. LPI values confirmed that the internal efficiency of the Lithuanian logistics system exceeds similar systems in Russia and Kazakhstan. Social implications In this paper, ways to improve supply chain management of dairy products in the context of globalization have been determined, the prerequisites for the formation of the perishable goods market according to the balance of supply and demand and the institutional mechanism of this process, which represents important information for all interested economic agents, have been analyzed. Originality/value The proposed approach points to the importance of having detailed information on the supply chain infrastructure and the need to introduce a single information space based on modern information and communication technologies.

TI Effect of eco-innovation on green supply chain management, circular
   economy capability, and performance of small and medium enterprises
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The social structures in organisations constitute essential enablers for the betterment of small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. Our paper explores such enablers in the context of SMEs' contribution to the Circular Economy (CE), through the lens of institutional and dynamic capability view theories. We focus on the relationships between institutional pressures, eco-innovation, green supply chain management (GSCM) practices, CE capability, big data driven supply chains (BDSC), and performance for CE supply chains. We used a survey to collect data (n = 240) from people working in SMEs in the manufacturing sector in South Africa. Drawing from institutional theory, we find that coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures have a positive relationship with eco-innovation. Furthermore, eco-innovation is positively associated with GSCM, with these two concepts significantly related to the building of CE capability. The final element in our framework shows a positive relationship between GSCM and CE capability. Our findings reveal some nuances in terms of the relationships between the concepts. For example, whilst BDSCs have a moderating influence on the relationship between CE capability and firm performance for the CE supply chain, no such influence is evident for the relationship between GSCM practices and performance. Further work needs to focus on explaining this and other findings and on validating our theoretical framework.

TI SYNCHRONIZED BARRIERS FOR CIRCULAR SUPPLY CHAINS IN INDUSTRY
   3.5/INDUSTRY 4.0 TRANSITION FOR SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Transition from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0, in other words Industry 3.5 stage, and moving to a circular economy are two significant concepts for organizations that need to make wholesale alterations to their current systems. In order to stay competitive, both these transitions need to follow sustainable resource management and digital transformation principles. However, there are barriers to these changes that organizations should consider. Both Industry 4.0 transition, in other words Industry 3.5, and circularity transition require great efforts to deal with these barriers; in the current environment, organizations need to deal with these barriers simultaneously for more sustainable resource management. This study focuses in particular on circular supply chains in the Industry 3.5 stage. There are some studies that suggest barriers to Industry 4.0 and circular supply chains separately, none of these studies consider them together. From this point of view, this study contributes to existing literature by presenting synchronized barriers that integrate circular supply chain and Industry 4.0 barriers. Firstly, pillars of circular supply chains in Industry 4.0 are explained; synchronized barriers are then presented. A decision-making method, Fuzzy Analytical Network Process, is used to prioritize the synchronized barriers, with theoretical and practical implications proposed according to the result of the implementation.

TI Supply Chain Governance Mechanisms, Green Supply Chain Management, and
   Organizational Performance
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB While firms understand that implementing green supply chain management (GSCM) is important, they seem uncertain about how to manage their green initiatives by looking beyond their own facilities. Building a green supply chain requires the participation of all partner firms across the supply chain. However, partner firms are different in size, situation, capabilities, and even industries. Thus, encouraging them to participate in green initiatives is difficult. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hesitate to comply with green initiatives as they require a substantial amount of investment. This study empirically examines the causal relationship between the partnership governance mechanism and the success of GSCM. Based on transaction-cost economics theory (i.e., opportunism) and relational perspectives (i.e., trust) as the theoretical background, this study found that governance mechanisms between suppliers and manufacturers are positively related to GSCM performance. It showed that formal governance is important in the process-management side, while relational governance is critical for sharing knowledge in GSCM. The implications of the study results provide strategic insights on how the choice of governance mechanism affects GSCM performance and thus a firm's competitiveness.

AB This article presents a literature review to identify the current knowledge of supply chains 4.0 from the sustainability perspective. Reviewed papers were classified in terms of objectives, results, and sustainability approaches. Additionally, a critical discussion with the main results and recommendations for further research was carried out. Manufacturing supply chains have been contemplated but agri-food supply chains and chains related to diversified cropping systems have been also considered. In this way, 54 articles were identified and revised, and were classified according to the three main aspects of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. The classification of articles indicated that more attention has been paid to the environmental aspect in the industry 4.0 (I4.0) context in the literature, while the social aspect has been paid less attention. Finally, reference frameworks were identified, along with the I4.0 models, algorithms, heuristics, metaheuristics, and technologies, which have enabled sustainability in supply chains.

AB This paper describes the development of a combined collaborative planning model for global supply chains under environmental dynamics and uncertainties. The proposed approach is based on multi-agent modeling of global supply chains, and employs a combination of Q-learning, system dynamics, and Bayesian networks in a multi-agent architecture. It is enhanced by heuristics information from fluctuation estimations of the critical states context of supply chain networks such as process lead-time and demand variables. The heuristics are used as constraint information for aligning local agents planning with respect to system global goals, and to navigate the trade-offs between satisfying demand service levels and cost goals through the interaction and coordination between agents. Through multi-agent simulations, we compare and analyze the corresponding collaborative tactics on global supply chain planning with different products and for different environmental conditions.

AB Environmentally responsible actions can play a strategic role in protecting and enhancing the image of a supply chain The production rate of manufacturing activities is a driver that affects environmental performance the most. It becomes faster with learning, which results in generating more CO2 emissions. In this contribution, a vendor-buyer green supply chain model is studied, considering a decentralised and a centralised optimised policy. They consider investing in learning in production and in reducing CO2 emissions of the production process. A numerical example is presented to compare the behaviour of the model under the two policies. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Supply chain collaboration in industrial symbiosis networks
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A strategy supporting the development towards a circular economy is industrial symbiosis (IS). It is a form of collaborative supply chain management aiming to make industry more sustainable and achieve collective benefits based on utilization of waste, by-products, and excess utilities between economically independent industries. Based on an extensive analysis of published studies on existing IS collaborations and interviews with central stakeholders of a comprehensive IS, this paper investigates IS from a supply chain collaboration perspective. A theoretical framework is built and used to discuss how industrial symbiosis pursues sustainability and to identify the main collaboration aspects and performance impacts. This framework is then used in the analysis of selected published cases. Based on this, we derive propositions on the organizational and operational requirements for collaboration in the context of IS networks, related to the supply chain integration and coordination practices. As IS has only received little attention in the operations and supply chain management community, our propositions directly lead to future research directions. Furthermore, the analysis in this paper provides directions to increase the feasibility and resource efficiency of IS networks and can hence be used by stakeholders involved in these networks.

TI Evaluating indicators of the agility of the green supply chain
SO COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB Purpose Nowadays, the main problem of industries is the issue of environmental pollution. The green supply chain (GSC) is one of the processes that can be effective to consider this issue and its practices in all working processes in every organizations, so that the concept of GSC has been emerged with the acceleration of the government regulations and rules to achieve environmental standards and the increasing demands of consumers to supply green products. Therefore, the organizations should move toward the development of environmental activities in today's turbulent world. In other words, the current organizations should consider making their supply chain more agile and green to survive in the competition arena or in other words, they should consider making agile the GSC. The necessity of considering this issue needs to identify the evaluating indicators of the agility of the GSC. This study aims to consider this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach With reviewing the research literature and having survey with the experts, totally 7 criteria and 37 sub-criteria were identified as the evaluating indicators of the agility of the GSC. The results from collecting research data and using the confirmatory-factor analysis suggest the suitability of the above-mentioned indicators.
   Findings The idea of the GSC is to remove or minimize the greenhouse, chemical/hazardous gases and waste throughout the supply chain. On one hand, the agility of the supply chain as an operational capability in quick response to the uncertain and turbulent markers not only improves the performance of the company but also leads to cost decrease and increase of the professional capabilities. Therefore, the organizations should step toward the development of the environmental activities in the today's turbulent world. The importance of the issue of agility and considering the environment in the supply chain double the necessity of identification of the factors of agility of the GSC.
   Originality/value The present research considers the identification of the evaluating indicators of the agility of the GSC in industries.

In the past years, significant research effort has been devoted to extend current approaches to capture these objectives in order to guarantee long term sustainability. Among the various approaches developed, inventory management, product design, production planning and control for remanufacturing, product recovery, reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains have gained more attention in the literature. In this paper, we review some of the relevant research on sustainable chemical processes and supply chain design focusing on three main areas: (i) sustainable supply chains with respect to energy efficiency and waste management, (ii) environmentally sustainable supply chains and (iii) sustainable water management. The emerging challenges in this area are summarized, and future opportunities are highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The two concepts are increasingly aligned, and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) represents an evolving field where they explicitly interact. Given their complex and holistic nature, breaking down the literature to understand its structures, processes, connections and limitations can provide an objective view of the status of research in these highly important fields, identifying key areas for future research/theory development.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of current SCM literature is carried out, specifically in relation to the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability.
   Findings - SSCM and the integration of sustainability into supply chains is a significant but evolving field evidenced by a current bias in the literature towards theory development and highly qualitative research methods. The environmental dimension is significantly better represented in the literature through specific processes at all stages of the supply chain. The social dimension is recognised, but receives less emphasis than expected given SCM's focus on interaction, relationships and communication. These two dimensions are treated separately in the literature with limited insight on how to integrate them and current SCM and sustainability research provides limited practical outputs.
   Research limitations/implications - The review focuses on environmental and social sustainability within supply chains without explicit consideration of the economic dimension.
   Practical implications - The review highlights the key themes and issues for supply chain managers faced with implementing sustainability. It also illustrates a number of areas for future research, along with the need for researchers to develop more practical tools for implementing SSCM.
   Originality/value - Indicates the extent to which sustainability is integrated within SCM and where the research emphasis currently lies. The environmental dimension is significantly more defined and developed in the literature. SCM literature emphasises the importance of long-term supplier relationships, but this "people-focused" approach does not appear to translate into socially responsible supply chains. It suggests that the more process-driven nature of environmental sustainability makes it easier to put into supply chain practice. There is also limited research or evidence on how the two dimensions can be integrated despite recognition of their inter-relationship.

TI Blockchain Technology Application Challenges in Renewable Energy Supply
   Chain Management
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB With the advent of new technologies and globalization of business, supply chains have turned into indispensable tools for gaining competitive advantage. The application of new technologies like blockchain can benefit sustainable energy supply chains by improving chain and logistics operations in the areas of trust, transparency and accountability, cooperation, information sharing, financial exchanges, and supply chain integration. However, the efforts to adopt such technologies in supply chains tend to face many challenges and challenges, which can seriously threaten their success. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine the challenges to blockchain technology application. This research focuses on identifying the criteria and challenges to the application of blockchain in renewable energy supply chains and also ranks the identified challenges in terms of their capacity to disrupt the process. The applicability of the suggested structure is examined in a case study of the renewable energy supply chain of Iran. In this study, the challenges are evaluated and ranked by the hybrid developed methods by the integration of the concept of gray numbers into the gray stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA-Gray) and the gray evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS-Gray). Another group of hybrid methods including the gray weighted sum method (WSM-Gray), the gray complex proportional assessment (COPRAS-Gray), and the gray technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS-Gray) is used to validate the results. The rankings obtained from all of these techniques show high degree of correlation. Among the identified challenges, "high investment cost" is found to be the most important challenge to the application of blockchain in sustainable energy supply chains.

TI Toward supply chain-wide sustainability assessment: a conceptual
   framework and an aggregation method to assess supply chain performance
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Due to factors such as increasingly stringent regulations and growing public awareness, companies are trying to reduce exposure to economic, environmental and socio-political risks in their supply chains. This paper addresses the problem of assessing such sustainability issues supply chain-wide. First, to clarify the status quo regarding current approaches, it reviews the literature and then groups the various approaches. Second, the paper provides a conceptual framework for supply chain sustainability assessment. Finally, an overview of available methods is provided, and three approaches to assessing and aggregating sustainability indicators are proposed. These approaches allow for the aggregation of the sustainability performance of individual companies into a supply chain-wide sustainability performance by means of quantitative and qualitative indicators. The results are based on a literature review of sustainability assessment in supply chains as well as on focus group workshops with experts from the European automotive and electronics industry. This paper contributes to the theory and practice of sustainability assessment in supply chains by providing a literature analysis, seven key industrial requirements, a conceptual framework and aggregation approaches. The framework and the methods integrate a comprehensive sustainability perspective emphasizing the understudied social dimension. They lay the groundwork for defining specific indicators and for an integration into a software solution for supply chain sustainability data exchange. This enables corporate decision makers to assess and trace the supply chain sustainability performance of products and organizations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A location-inventory-routing model for green supply chains with
   low-carbon emissions under uncertainty
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The location-inventory-routing modeling is an integrated and comprehensive approach to the interconnected location planning, inventory management, and vehicle routing problems in supply chain management. Supplier selection and order allocation are critical operational and strategic decisions in green supply chains. Green supply chain management is an environmental approach to sourcing and production that considers sustainability in every supply chain stage. In this study, a novel bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to solve the location-inventory-routing problems in green supply chains with low-carbon emissions under uncertainty. The proposed model is used for supplier selection and order allocation by considering the location priorities, heterogeneous vehicle routing, storage needs, uncertain demand, and backorder shortage. The formulated bi-objective model is solved with a weighted fuzzy multi-objective solution approach coupled with a novel intelligent simulation algorithm to ensure the feasibility of the solution space. We generate and solve different-sized problems to demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed model.

TI Residual Agroforestry Biomass Supply Chain Simulation Insights and
   Directions: A Systematic Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Residual biomass is a reliable source of energy and hence requires effective supply chain management for optimal performance and sustainability. While there are various studies on this recent trend, a comprehensive review of the literature on simulation-based modeling of the supply chain for residual agroforestry biomass is lacking. This study aims to present a systematic review of relevant literature surrounding residual agroforestry supply chain simulation insights and directions. The systematic literature review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 standards and intends to answer the research questions based on (1) Key Performance Indicators (KPI); (2) Simulation techniques; and (3) Efficient supply chain. A search of the Science Direct, SCOPUS, and UA EBSCO databases was conducted using the appropriate keywords combination. The databases were searched, and a total of 1617 papers were appraised automatically. Subsequently, the titles, keywords, and abstracts of 172 papers were examined. Following the full-text analysis, 20 papers in addition to 27 articles taken from other sources matched the requirements for study inclusion. The publications accessed reveals that simulation-based techniques will optimize the supply chain for residual biomass when applied.

TI Optimal sustainability investment and pricing decisions in a two-echelon
   supply chain with emissions-sensitive demand under cap-and-trade policy
SO OPSEARCH
AB With the alarming increase in global warming, business activities are being modified by green/sustainable initiatives through immense research. This paper considers a sustainable supply chain which consists of a supplier and a manufacturer. The market demand is emissions-sensitive besides dependent on the selling price and sustainability levels of the supplier and the manufacturer. To maintain the sustainability level of the whole supply chain, both the supply chain entities make investments. The decision behaviors of the centralized and the decentralized channels are compared and a two-part tariff contract is implemented to coordinate the supply chain under the cap-and-trade policy. It is found from the numerical study that the total profit in the centralized system is almost 10% higher than that of the decentralized system. Further, the two-part tariff contract leads to a perfect channel coordination. Sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the effects of key model-parameters on the optimal decisions.

TI Theoretical Framework for a Local, Agile Supply Chain to Create
   Innovative Product Closer to End-user: Onshore-Offshore Debate
SO OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB This paper presents a conceptual model of a viable onshore, agile supply chain approach for innovative product manufacturers in the manufacturing sector. As such, this paper provides insight into the drawbacks of offshore manufacturing and an empirical investigation into the importance of the manufacturing sector. This study aims to answer the research question: how can agile supply chain management add value to the manufacturing to create innovative products closer to the end-user? A theoretical framework was developed through a qualitative methodology to demonstrate effective onshore operation and supply chain. For the first time, the combination of Dynamic Capabilities (DC) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) theories has been used as a lens to examine the location decision of a close geographical supply chain network - global supply chain debate. Offshore manufacturing and global sourcing do not appear to fit the DC theory in a geographically and culturally distant situation, especially when supply chains involve operations in different continents. The `theoretical perspective', including DC and TCO suggests that companies should frequently integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competences to promptly react to the changing environment and they should also wisely calculate all the indirect, hidden, lifecycle and transaction costs of an operation when considering moving production offshore. Although studies in the agile supply chain area have examined competitiveness from several perspectives, there has been little to no research focusing on the advantages of agile, nearshore operation and supply chain solutions. This research notably widens the theoretical perspective of agility and adaptability for innovative product manufacturers in the manufacturing sector, and the viability of remaining close to the market and apply agile supply chain.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB In this article, efficiency, safety, and industrial emission factors are incorporated into a sustainable supply chain by constructing a multi-objective programming model that jointly minimizes costs, emissions, and employee injuries. The purpose is to give supply chain managers a tool for decision making that is not only based on reducing costs (maximizing profit) but also focuses on environmental protection and social responsibility. Using the weighted-sum approach with weights setting by the analytic hierarchy process, the model is solved by normalization of the minima of the three objectives. A numerical example is presented to test the model. This article has developed a multi-objective model for multi-modes of production facilities. The results show that the developed model for optimizing supply chain improved supply chain sustainability. A new multi-dimension perspective for optimizing supply chain will help experts improve their insights, ideas to have a sustainable supply chain.

SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector has had only limited success so far. In Sweden, the uptake of highly energy efficient buildings such as passive houses has been very patchy, although some regions perform much better than others. This article investigates the interlinkage of organizational structures of housing companies with techno-material characteristics of such buildings, as one of the factors of this uneven development. Empirically, the paper studies two passive house companies in their regional settings in Sweden. The results show that technological characteristics of passive houses co-develop with organizational changes in housing companies such as new types of economic investment calculations, business models, project planning and energy modelling tools. The organizational re-making of housing companies can be seen as a crucial step in the transition to a sustainable housing sector.

TI Traceability and foreign corporate accountability in mineral supply
   chains
SO REGULATION & GOVERNANCE
AB Industrialized economies in the EU depend heavily on imports of minerals. The extraction and parts of the transport and processing of these minerals take place in the Global South and often bear high human rights and environmental risks. A lack of traceability in mineral supply chains makes it particularly difficult to hold companies accountable for negative environmental and social impacts of their operations and those of their suppliers. This paper analyses three mineral supply chains (copper, platinum, and gold) in order to develop propositions about how supply chain-specific characteristics affect traceability and foreign corporate accountability (FCA) in mineral supply chains. The analytical framework focuses on three dimensions: geopolitical dynamics, industry characteristics, and private governance mechanisms. The authors argue that chain-specific characteristics may foster or thwart traceability and FCA in mineral supply chains and thus provides a novel contribution to the debate on traceability and accountability in mineral supply chains.

TI Circular supply chain management: a bibliometric analysis-based
   literature review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Supply chain management (SCM) research has contributed to the transition to a circular economy (CE). Still, confusions exist on the related terms, and no review has mapped out the development trends in the domain. This research clarifies the boundaries of the relevant concepts. Then, it conducts a comprehensive review of the circular SCM (CSCM) literature and identifies opportunities for future research.Design/methodology/approach - Using relevant keywords, 1,130 journal articles published in December 31, 2021 were identified. Unlike the published reviews, which mainly relied on content analysis, this review uses bibliometric analysis tools, including citation analysis, co-citation analysis and cluster analysis. The review identifies general trends, influential researchers, high-impact publications, citation patterns and established and emergent research themes.Findings - The extant CSCM literature includes five prominent clusters: (1) reverse channel optimization; (2) CSCM review and empirical studies; (3) closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) and consumers; (4) CLSC and inventory management and (5) CLSC and reverse logistics (RL). Significant research gaps exist in the use of secondary and longitudinal data, a wider range of theories, mixed-methods, multi-method, action research and behavioral experiment. The least researched topics include zero waste, industrial symbiosis, circular product design, sourcing and supply management and reuse.Originality/value - This is the first bibliometric analysis-based literature review on CSCM. It clarifies the interrelated supply chain sustainability terms and thus reduces related confusion. It offers insights into the patterns in the CSCM literature and suggests important research directions.

TI Big data and supply chain resilience: role of decision-making technology
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - As global supply chains continue to develop, uncertainty grows and supply chains are frequently threatened with disruption. Although big data technology is being used to improve supply chain resilience, big data technology's role in human-machine collaboration is shifting between "supporters" and "substitutes." However, big data technology's applicability in supply chain management is unclear. Choosing appropriate big data technology based on the enterprise's internal and external environments is important.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study built a three-factor structural model of the factors "management support," "big data technology adoption" and "supply chain resilience". Big data technology adoption was divided into big data-assisted decision-making technology (ADT) and big data intelligent decision-making technology (IDT). A survey was conducted on more than 260 employees from supply chain departments in Chinese companies. The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling using Analyze of Moment Structures (AMOS) software.
   Findings - The study's empirical results revealed that adopting both ADT and IDT improved supply chain resilience. The effects of both types of big data were significant in low-dynamic environments, but the effect of IDT on supply chain resilience was insignificant under high-dynamic environments. The authors also found that government support had an insignificantly effect on IDT adoption but significantly boosted ADT adoption, whereas management support factors promoted both ADT and IDT adoption.
   Originality/value - By introducing two types of big data technology from the perspectives of the roles in human-machine collaborative decision-making, the research results provide a theoretical basis and management implications for enterprises to reduce the supply chain risk of enterprises.

TI Balancing cybersecurity in a supply chain under direct and indirect
   cyber risks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Cybersecurity is an essential requirement for the sustainability of global supply chains. In this paper, a stochastic programming formulation is presented for optimisation of cybersecurity investment and selection of security controls to mitigate and balance the impact of direct and indirect (propagated) cyber risks in a multi-tier supply chain. Using a network transformation combined with the first-order Taylor series approximation of natural logarithm to linearise the nonlinear constraints, a nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model is approximated by its linear equivalent. The problem objective is to determine an optimal cybersecurity investment under limited budget and portfolio of security controls for each supply chain node to balance the cybersecurity over the entire supply chain. The minmax objective functions are applied to minimise either the maximum breach probability or the maximum loss of supply chain nodes. Alternatively, maxmin objectives are used to maximise either the minimum non-breach probability or the minimum saving of loss. The proposed integrated modelling approach is illustrated with results of computational study and a comparison of approximated and exact solution values is presented. The decision-making insights are provided and discussed.

TI The role of supply chain orientation in achieving supply chain
   sustainability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Supply chain orientation (SCO) has the potential to contribute to supply chain sustainability performance. The literature, however, has not determined whether SCO has a direct effect on supply chain sustainability performance, nor has it differentiated between the effects of different categories of SCO on supply chain sustainability performance. A SEM analysis of data collected from supply chain managers determined that the SCO construct of supply chain collaboration and communication could directly affect both supply chain environmental and social sustainability performance. The SCO construct of internal supply chain coordination, however, affected only supply chain environmental sustainability performance and this effect was mediated by the organisation's internal supply chain sustainability practices. A second path between supply chain collaboration and communication and supply chain environmental sustainability performance, which was mediated by internal supply chain sustainability practices was also identified. These findings indicate that different SCO constructs have different effect pathways in relation to supply chain sustainability performance. The identification of the effects of different categories of SCO and the SCO - performance relationship has important implications for SCO research design.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB In the last decade, food and drink supply chain management has become an important part of global operations strategy. The global food and drink industries (FDIs) is establishing supply chain operations across countries as a result of increasing demand, this expansion has created challenges in coordinating operations that connect multi-suppliers, one as such is the financial enabler for the multi-layered supply chain network. However, literature on artificial intelligence (AI) in FDIs is limited, this study explores AI theory in supply chain networks and alternative supply chain financing for the FDIs. This study proposes a new conceptual framework based on theoretical contributions identified through literature, a conceptual framework is established and further developed to a meta-framework. This study explored the set-theoretic comparative approach for data analysis, the outcomes of this research suggest that the probable contributions of supply chain networks driven by AI technologies provide a sustainable financing stream for the food and drink supply chain.

AB In a global business environment, effective supply chain management (SCM) is becoming more and more important for companies to remain competitive. Most traditional SCM researches focus on improving performance of supply chain. However, owing to existence of uncertainty or unpredictable events, some supply chains often suffer systemic damages and risks. Therefore, it is critical to account for risk while designing supply chain structures so that they perform well even after an unexpected event has occurred. In this paper, we present a planning model that balances the severity of damage and cost control when planning for risk, and then build a simulation flow for this model. Simulation and analysis of a simplified example from a company is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above model.

TI Innovative Approaches to Improve Sustainability of Physical Distribution
   in Dutch Agrifood Supply Chains
SO EFFICIENCY IN SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN
SE EcoProduction
AB Sustainability has become an important issue in all aspects of corporate policy. This also applies to organizations operating in agrifood supply chains. Most literature on sustainability in the agrifood industry focuses on food security or prevention of food losses. However, little attention has been paid to how organizations working in agrifood supply chains use new approaches and innovations for making physical distribution more sustainable. Therefore we set up a study on how companies in the agrifood supply chains use innovations to improve the sustainability of the physical distribution. For this purpose, we have interviewed key managers of 14 Dutch companies-6 logistics service providers, 3 wholesalers and 5 food processors-all involved in agrifood value chains on how they approach, and innovatively improve, sustainability within physical distribution. We found that all the groups of companies have sustainability in their mission and use various innovations for improving the sustainability of their physical distribution. We also found that various links in the chain preferred different types of innovations e.g. food processors preferred innovations linked to reduction strategy and wholesalers focused on innovations related to efficiency strategy. The applied innovations were not linked to the supply chain as a whole, but concentrated on a specific aspect of the supply chain and were often initiated by a partner from outside the agrifood supply chain.

TI Blockchain Technology Adoption for Improved Environmental Supply Chain
   Performance: The Mediation Effect of Supply Chain Resilience, Customer
   Integration, and Green Customer Information Sharing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Due to the complexity of building supply chain resilience (SCR) towards long-term environmental sustainability amendments, the use of emerging technologies such as Blockchain Technology (BCT) can be adopted as an innovative tool to enhance the sustainability and resilience of supply chains, especially in uncertain environments. Drawing on the Knowledge-Based View (KBV) and Dynamic Capability View (DCV), this research aims to demonstrate how the adoption of BCT can enhance the environmental supply chain performance (SCP). A total of 603 valid surveys were collected from respondents from manufacturing and service organizations in Egypt. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modelling, and results revealed that BCT adoption alone had a negative direct impact on environmental SCP. However, when this relationship was mediated by SCR and sequentially mediated by customer integration and green customer information sharing, the results were positive. This research presents insights on how organizations can adapt to dynamic business environments, and, in addition, it extends the theories of KBV and DCV in an empirical contribution by filling the gap in understanding regarding how environmental SCP can be enhanced through the adoption of BCT.

TI Bibliometric and Text Analytics Approaches to Review COVID-19 Impacts on
   Supply Chains
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The current COVID-19 pandemic has virtually disrupted supply chains worldwide. Thus, supply chain research has received significant attention. While the impacts have been immeasurable, organizations have realized the need to design strategies to overcome such unexpected events. Therefore, the supply chain research landscape has evolved to address the challenges during the pandemic. However, available literature surveys have not explored the power of text analytics. Hence, in this review, an analysis of the supply chain literature related to the impacts of COVID-19 is performed to identify the current research trends and future research avenues. To discover the frequent topics discussed in the literature, bibliometric analysis (i.e., keyword co-occurrence network) and text mining tools (i.e., N-gram analysis and topic modeling) are employed for the whole corpus and the top-three contributing journals (i.e., Sustainability, International Journal of Logistics Management, Operations Management Research). Moreover, text analytics (i.e., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency: TF-IDF) is utilized to discover the distinctive topics in the corpus and per journals. A total of 574 papers published up to the first semester of 2022 were collected from the Scopus database to determine the research trends and opportunities. The keyword network identified four clusters considering the implementation of digitalization to achieve resilience and sustainability, the usage of additive manufacturing during the pandemic, the study of food supply chains, and the development of supply chain decision models to tackle the pandemic. Moreover, the segmented keyword network analysis and topic modeling were performed for the top three contributors. Although both analyses draw the research concentrations per journal, the keyword network tends to provide a more general scope, while the topic modeling gives more specific topics. Furthermore, TF-IDF scores unveiled topics rarely studied, such as the implications of the pandemic on plasma supply chains, cattle supply chains, and reshoring decisions, to mention a few. Additionally, it was observed how the different methodologies implemented allowed to complement the information provided by each method. Based on the findings, future research avenues are discussed. Therefore, this research will help supply chain practitioners and researchers to identify supply chain advancements, gaps in the literature and future research streams.

TI A pilot study of radon levels in certified passive house buildings
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB The international Passive House Standard delivers high thermal comfort based on the principles of excellent building fabric and balanced mechanical heat recovery ventilation. Considering that the typical person in industrial countries (such as the UK) spends similar to 90% of their time indoors, there are surprisingly few academic studies on air quality in the home. Indoor air quality and the prevalence of overheating are attracting an increasing amount of research attention across Europe, but post occupancy monitoring of indoor radon concentrations is severely underrepresented, especially in Ireland and the UK. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and known carcinogen that presents a potential risk to occupier health. This pilot study investigates measured radon levels in certified Passive House buildings in Northern Ireland and presents an overview of technical radon prevention design options for new builds and mitigation measures for existing buildings. Initial findings indicate that buildings built to the Passive House Standard correspond with reduced indoor radon gas concentrations.
   Practical application: This Technical Note addresses an issue pertinent to the industry at this time. The growth of energy-efficient standards (such as Passive House) and common principles (such as increased airtightness levels and mechanical ventilation systems) has accelerated the need for research data on indoor radon concentrations. This research bridges the knowledge gap between the fields of indoor air quality (specifically radon), health, sustainability and the built environment.

TI Sustainable, multimodal and reliable supply chain design
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Emerging issues and new challenges of globalization have forced companies to design their supply chains for not only minimizing cost but also considering other factors. Supply chains are exposed to new environmental regulations to reduce their carbon emissions and compelled to consider other overlooked factors, such as risk. In this paper, we consider a multi-echelon multimodal supply chain network design problem with multiple products and components that take economic, environmental and risk factors into account. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and constrained by a carbon cap-and-trade scheme and a risk threshold. This novel problem realistically portrays the supply chain network design considering sustainability and reliability factors simultaneously. The proposed model has been tested on randomly generated hypothetical but realistic test instances. The impacts of different risk thresholds and unit carbon prices on the supply chain cost, risk and emissions are analyzed. The effects of multimodal transportation modes on cost, risk and emissions are also tested. Results prove that using multimodal transportation decreases supply chain cost and carbon emission. In addition, the total supply chain cost and carbon emission increase if the decision maker is risk-averse. The choice of transportation modes is sensitive only to emission levels.

TI Effective affordable housing provision in developing economies: An
   evaluation of expert opinion
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Housing the urban poor is a prevalent challenge in developing economies, regardless of the research attention and policy interventions over the years. It becomes essential to employ innovative approaches in investigating the challenge of affordable housing (AH) provision to achieve effective AH provision in developing economies. It is pragmatic to thoroughly explore expert solutions to the difficult task of housing the urban poor. To achieve this, focus group discussion and semi-structured interviews with housing experts in Nigeria were conducted in this study. The recordings were transcribed and analysed using NVivo; following descriptive, content and thematic analyses of data we found that deliberate government policies to include the urban poor are the most significant housing solutions consistent across the entire housing supply value chain (HSVC). Major findings are that mainstreaming the use of alternative housing construction materials and strategies, deliberate finance models to target the urban poor and deliberate reservation of some urban land for housing the urban poor are strategies that will enhance AH provision. These are insights into critical solutions to AH constraints and are informative for effective AH provision for the urban poor in Nigeria; an essential ingredient for sustainable development goals. This study is first to explore experts' opinions in relation to HSVC to showcase significant solutions to AH provision challenges. Data from this study are essential for future pro-poor housing studies. Recommendations are that AH interventions should be informed by research for more effective and sustainable results.

Second, to understand the relationship between the sustainability practices in a particular supply chain stage with its operational performances, in the same stage and in other stages. Third, to identify the link between sustainability practices implemented in a particular supply chain stage and reputation in the same stage and in other stages. The study is grounded on the institutional theory and involves multiple cases in four different food supply chain (FSC) stages, in Italy. Findings indicate a varied practice implementation in different stages in the chain, motivated by different institutional pressures, which is in turn related to the company's performance and reputation aims. This multi-stage study provides a more holistic interpretation of sustainability in the FSC, recognizing the importance of setting appropriate sustainability strategies and goals in each stage.

TI Impact of information technology and knowledge sharing on circular food
   supply chains for green business growth
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Rapid and dynamic changes in environment, technologies, consumer behavior, policy making, and climate are putting extra pressure to food supply chain, especially in terms of efficiently manage food security, food surplus, food loss, and waste. These changes directly affect food supply chain negatively. Thus, transition into more circular approach for green business growth in food supply chains is a necessity. One way to reduce this negativity is to ensure the share of information along the chain. With this context, sharing information and knowledge among the food supply chain can facilitate practices from a circularity and green perspectives. Hence, this research focuses on understanding and revealing knowledge-sharing networks challenges, barriers, and benefits across every food supply chain layer, presenting tangible contributions to improve traceability in circularity perspectives with refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover challenges. Therefore, and to provide a green business growth, this study examines the practice of knowledge sharing among real-life industry food stakeholders in the meat sector regarding their dimensions, what type of knowledge is shared and whether there are differences among specific groups of food stakeholders for the knowledge sharing. The aim of this research is to generate a validated conceptual framework to reveal how information technologies contributes to a more efficient knowledge sharing practices, hence, to impact the enhancement of efficient circular food supply chains for green business growth.

TI Converging concepts of sustainability and supply chain networks: a
   systematic literature review approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In recent years, companies have been under increasing pressure from consumers, grassroots and community organizations, governments, and shareholders to develop and practice sustainable business practices. Academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chain management has risen considerably in recent years. This can be seen in the number of papers published. This paper aims to systematically investigate the discipline of supply chain management (SCM) within the context of sustainability. The two concepts are increasingly aligned, and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) represents an evolving field where they explicitly interact. The study proposes a conceptual framework to classify various factors along the triple bottom-line pillars of sustainability issues in the context of supply chains. The findings indicate that the existing literature is primarily focused on individual sustainability and supply chain dimensions rather than taking a more integrated approach. Also, the economic benefits of developing a sustainable supply chain for an organization are discussed in addition to specific features of sustainable supply chains and limitations of existing research; this should stimulate further research. Our analysis revealed trends and gaps, allowing us to create a solid agenda for additional SSCM research.

AB For the improvement of sustainability in a shipbuilding supply chain, we first analyze the decisions on the energy efficiency of main engines (EEME) and the price of the shipbuilding service. Then, objective functions are developed for the portfolio selection of main engines according to different supply chain strategies. Furthermore, experimental analysis is conducted to make observations and illustrate some related issues. The results suggest that technological innovations should be advocated to reduce the fixed costs for effective improvements of the EEME. When supply chain coordination is realized, the best environment performance and the highest consumer surplus can be achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Is a multiple supply chain management perspective a new way to manage
   global supply chains toward sustainability?
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The imperative for building a sustainable future depends on how organizations manage their supply chains, which are responsible for processing raw materials into finished products. Recently, a new trend has been emerging in some companies, considering not only an entire supply chain but several supply chains inside the organization. This way of approaching sustainability, by focusing on several supply chains, can be called a multiple supply chain perspective, and professionals' interest in this context has been growing. This study aims to explore essential components needed to manage multiple supply chains toward sustainability from a focal company perspective. Sustainability reports from 25 companies leaders in supply chain management are analyzed using content analysis and correspondence analysis. As a result, a conceptual model is proposed, considering four essential components: supply chain processes; relational mechanisms; monitoring and control mechanisms; and sustainability outcomes. Based on this conceptual model, six propositions are elaborated to be further empirically explored in the literature. The proposed conceptual model helps supply chain and sustain -ability managers to improve their efforts toward sustainability by revealing what components are needed to manage each different supply chain and by helping to create more focused strategies that are effective in different scenarios.

AB Agricultural supply-chain in developing countries has been recognized to have critical complications, e.g., seasonal supply-demand complexity, high emission factor, economic inequality, social conflicts, etc. Thus, it requires a significant transformation to solve its latent problems. This study suggests the transformation by conducting a postharvest engineering by the application of appropriate technology. As an ex-farm strategy, postharvest engineering offers less interventions to any existing process taken by least developing societal groups. In parallel, appropriate technology puts an emphasis on the sustainability of a technological solution by using indigenous knowledge as its basis. Their combination will then transform the whole supply-chain in terms of four different perspectives. Technically, supply-chain complexity requires an interconnected calculation of supply-demand network. Besides, economic value added needs to be redistributed throughout the chain. Next, applying an appropriate technology in conducting postharvest processing will change the life-cycle assessment of a commodity being treated. Then, involved parties in the chain require a renewed partnership to intermediate different interests. In short, this study proposes a notion on a set of comprehensive solutions from different views to solve problematic issues within any agricultural supply-chain in many developing countries.

TI A hub-and-spoke model for multi-dimensional integration of green
   marketing and sustainable supply chain management
SO INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB Since the concept of sustainability was transformed into business mainstream, both sustainable supply chain management and green marketing have become key topics of academic research and managerial practices. Great advances have been made in the two areas in parallel. It has been recognized that green marketing and sustainable supply chain management should be seamlessly integrated so that green customer's needs can be better met by the supply chain capabilities. Existing research has explored point-to-point integration approach. This paper proposes a new hub-and-spoke integration model to integrate green marketing and sustainable supply chain management from six dimensions: product, promotion, planning, process, people and project (called the 6Ps). Empirical study has been undertaken with industries to test the 6Ps integration model. Results from the empirical study on integration dimensions, integration strategies, and drivers and obstacles for multi-dimensional integration are presented together with managerial implications. The new integration model allows the flows of resources such as information, materials and funds between green marketing and sustainable supply chain management through multiple direct pathways. It has the potential to achieve better overall business performance against the triple bottom line objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This special issue mirrors the increasing relevance of this topic for both practitioners in companies, and academics. The purpose of this special issue is to serve as a catalyst to this important topic. Environmental and social problems and challenges do not stop at the gates of single companies, but have to be considered along the supply chains as the entities across which related material and information flows are organized. The aims of the paper are to introduce current research topics and provide an overview of the single papers. The papers cover supply chain strength of regions and regional activities as well as actions taken by small- and medium-sized manufacturing and public organizations. The papers in this issue also take a look at performance indicators and closed-loop supply chain aspects. Amongst these topics, four papers incorporate social aspects, which have been relatively and significantly less researched than environmental issues. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
AB Reverse supply chains are receiving increased attention for business and sustainability opportunities. As few organizations are adept at both forward and reverse supply chains, subcontracting various activities is imperative. Vendor selection that best achieves combined expertise for reverse supply chains, while quickly forming virtual enterprises to seize market opportunities, is an emerging issue. We formulate a novel 0-1 integer nonlinear optimization model, subsequently linearized to enable efficient computational performance, to select vendors that minimize the maximum formation time for creating agile virtual reverse supply chains. We then generate a portfolio of diverse, high-quality vendor assignments by adapting a recent algorithmic technique, thereby allowing industrial managers to address intangible factors into their final decisions. Computational experiments on simulated data demonstrate the model's efficiency for generating sets of high-quality and diverse solutions in reasonable timeframes.

TI A comparison of the energy consumption in two passive houses, one with a

SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Detailed measurements of the auxiliary energy consumption for space heating and domestic hot water preparation in two detached passive houses south of Oslo are reported for the full year 2013. The study compares two equal, new built houses heated with different technologies, one by solar thermal heating and the other with an air-to-water heat pump. The houses are built by central actors from the building industry with high potential of being representative for a sizable, new-built housing stock rather than with focus on system optimisation. The results show that the need for additional energy, corrected for differences in domestic hot water consumption and indoor temperature, is 15-20% higher in the heat pump heated house than in the solar heated house. However the general energy consumption exceeds significantly the dimensioned figures for passive houses in Norway. The measurements demonstrate that solar thermal heating is competitive with heat pump technology even at high latitudes under Norwegian climate even in the case of a non-optimised system. With the available data potential heating system design improvements were pointed out. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Transparency and sustainability in global commodity supply chains
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Over the last few decades rapid advances in processes to collect, monitor, disclose, and disseminate information have contributed towards the development of entirely new modes of sustainability governance for global commodity supply chains. However, there has been very little critical appraisal of the contribution made by different transparency initiatives to sustainability and the ways in which they can (and cannot) influence new governance arrangements. Here we seek to strengthen the theoretical underpinning of research and action on supply chain transparency by addressing four questions: (1) What is meant by supply chain transparency? (2) What is the relevance of supply chain transparency to supply chain sustainability governance? (3) What is the current status of supply chain transparency, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of existing initiatives? and (4) What propositions can be advanced for how transparency can have a positive transformative effect on the governance interventions that seek to strengthen sustainability outcomes? We use examples from agricultural supply chains and the zero deforestation agenda as a focus of our analysis but draw insights that are relevant to the transparency and sustainability of supply chains in general. We propose a typology to distinguish among types of supply chain information that are needed to support improvements in sustainability governance, and illustrate a number of major shortfalls and systematic biases in existing information systems. We also propose a set of ten propositions that, taken together, serve to expose some of the potential pitfalls and undesirable outcomes that may result from (inevitably) limited or poorly designed transparency systems, whilst offering guidance on some of the ways in which greater transparency can make a more effective, lasting and positive contribution to sustainability.

TI Smart green supply chain management: a configurational approach to
   enhance green performance through digital transformation
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose While it is known that digital transformation facilitates data flow in supply chains, its importance on green supply chain management (GSCM) has not been investigated concisely. This paper aims to expand the theory of digital transformation in GSCM by investigating the interconnections between these concepts and providing an integrative view of a smart green supply chain management (Smart GSCM). Design/methodology/approach This adopts a configurational perspective on digital transformation and supply chain management (SCM) to investigate the different dimensions of Smart GSCM and their contribution to green performance. Therefore, this paper analyzes data from 473 manufacturing companies using regression techniques. Findings The results show how smart supply chain contributes to green performance through managing green relationships (external GSCM activities) and establishing green operations (internal GSCM activities). Furthermore, this paper finds partial mediating effects for external and internal GSCM activities on green performance. These findings show that smart supply chain (i.e. digital transformation strategy and front-end technologies, supported by several back-end technologies) is directly associated with higher levels of GSCM. It is specifically associated with one of the internal dimensions of green operations, namely, green purchasing activities. Hence, the findings suggest that digital transformation alone is insufficient to achieve green performance, needing a GSCM configuration to mediate this effect. Practical implications This study calls attention to how managers should integrate these at least three different perspectives of SCM: digital transformation, external relationships and internal operations to increase green performance. Originality/value As the main contribution, this study provides a configurational and holistic understanding of the different dimensions and mechanisms in Smart GSCM.

TI Exploring the Global Research Trends of Supply Chain Management of
   Construction Projects Based on a Bibliometric Analysis: Current Status
   and Future Prospects
SO BUILDINGS
AB With the increasing scale and complexity of construction projects, a considerably growing number of studies have focused on managing supply chain scientifically to improve performance. To explore this field in depth, this paper uses the Bibliometrix R encapsulation tool to conduct a bibliometric analysis and visually display key findings on construction project supply chain management from 1998 to 2021. By using a series of indexes in econometric analysis, this paper introduces an overview of construction project supply chain research. Further, the current situation, historical evolution, and development of this field are explored using the content analysis of keywords. The results suggest that: (1) the number of publications in the field of the supply chain management of construction projects has increased over time and entered a period of rapid growth after 2015. During this period, articles related to 'sustainability', 'prefabricated housing', 'reverse logistics', and 'lean management' were widely cited by scholars, but the most frequently cited was 'partnership'. (2) The keywords in the field of construction project supply chain management can be divided into 'simulation research', 'sustainable research', 'method research', 'cooperation and integration', 'whole life cycle,' 'trust and communication', and so on.

TI Industry 4.0 technologies and circular economy: The mediating role of
   supply chain integration
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB There is a great expectation that Industry 4.0 technologies will enable better circular economy (CE) results at firms. However, it is unclear how these technologies might contribute to CE. We hypothesize that Industry 4.0 technologies are positively related to the level of integration among actors along the supply chain and within the firm supply chain integration (SCI), which, in turn, explains superior CE results. By employing partial least square structural equation models on original survey data based on a sample of more than 1200 Italian manufacturing firms and almost 200 adopters, we find that disentangling for the type of technologies is essential to understanding both their direct and indirect role toward CE. Smart manufacturing technologies have a stronger impact on CE outcomes than data processing technologies; the mediating effect of SCI is verified for the former but not for the latter type, questioning the possibility for those technologies to support sustained CE performance in the long run.

AB Supply chain integration is concerned with the close alignment and coordination among parties within a supply chain as a means of improving performance. Inventory management of global supply chains presents challenges to retail businesses in developing economies where several uncertainties relating to order cycle, lead times and inventory decisions exist. This paper examines supply chain integration and its effects on lead times for the retail industry in Ghana. In the retail industry where products have varying shelf lives, the importance of supply chain integration is critical for performance and survival in a competitive business environment. A case study approach was used where purposive sampling was employed to select two retail giants operating in Ghana. It was found that an integrated supply chain results in significant reductions in lead times. Depending on the product category and the degree of supply chain integration, lead time reductions can be as high as 40%. A partnership relationship between the buyer and the supplier results in higher percentage reduction in lead times compared with the adversarial relationships. The benefits of reduced lead times include improved product availability, customer satisfaction, supply chain performance and efficiency. A partnership relationship is recommended to derive maximum benefits of supply chain integration. However, in a new, risky or hostile environment, an adversarial buyer-supplier relationship is recommended.

TI Supply chain inclusion in base of the pyramid markets A cluster analysis
   and implications for global supply chains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore mechanisms of supply chain inclusion in Base of the Pyramid (BOP) settings. It distinguishes micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSME)-led local supply chains on the one hand and multinational enterprises (MNEs)-led global supply chains on the other hand. This paper aims to answer the following research question: Which mechanisms of supply chain inclusion are employed empirically by MSMEs and how can these mechanisms influence social impact creation in MNE-led global supply chains? Design/methodology/approach A large-scale empirical study of MSMEs operating in BOP markets is performed and a cluster analysis conducted to systematically categorize supply chain inclusion. The cluster analysis and current literature yield theory-based implications for MNE-led global supply chains. Findings The cluster analysis reveals three meaningful clusters of supply chain inclusion in BOP markets and highlights two main aspects. They include direct vs indirect mechanisms of inclusion and diversity in supplier relationships with local organizations aimed at either "sourcing" local capabilities needed for inclusion or "outsourcing" the inclusion. Based on these aspects, two scenarios are proposed and evaluated for local-global supply chain symbiosis.
   Originality/value This paper contributes a novel, combined perspective of local supply chains (MSMEs) and global supply chains (MNEs).

TI The Role of Green Collaborative Strategies in Improving Environmental
   Sustainability in Supply Chains: Insights from a Case Study
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB This article aims to quantify to what extent collaborative strategies are more effective than internal or organization-level actions to green supply chains. In this regard, the impact of decisions made at different stages of a supply chain in a product's carbon footprint is quantified. Organizational and product carbon footprints are calculated using the Compound Method Based on Financial Accounts (MC3). The results underline that concentrating reduction efforts in some stages of the supply chain is more effective than implementing individual actions by the participants. Collaboration among the participants is needed to decide what practices are implemented, at what stage they are needed and how they are to be implemented. This article adds to the literature on supply chains and sustainability. Previous research suggests that collaborative strategies have great potential for reducing the carbon footprint of products, while indicating the need for empirical research to support this statement.

TI Environmental and economic life cycle evaluation of potential energy
   efficiency measures on Latvian fish supply chain
SO FUTURE FOODS
AB The food industry consumes a significant amount of energy, and it is responsible for 20 to 30 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with cold supply chains absorbing about 70 percent of the energy expended in postagriculture food systems. Despite this, some gaps remain in the sector when looking toward identifying energy consumption hotspots and evaluating the impact of energy efficiency measures across the entire supply chain. This study implements an environmental Life Cycle Assessment and a Life Cycle Cost analysis to assess a Latvian fish cold supply chain and implement two energy efficiency measures in different stages. Specifically, a fish waste valorization scenario via anaerobic digestion processes, and a scenario implementing a photovoltaic system, are considered. Both strategies proved economically feasible and delivered environmental benefits at different levels than the defined baseline scenario. The energy production from fish waste showed the best economic evaluation performance, with an internal rate of return of 14.4 percent.

TI Food Supply Chain Transformation through Technology and Future Research
   Directions-A Systematic Review
SO LOGISTICS-BASEL
AB Background: Digital and smart supply chains are reforming the food chain to help eliminate waste, improve food safety, and reduce the possibility of a global food catastrophe. The globe currently faces numerous food-related issues, ranging from a lack of biodiversity to excessive waste, and from ill health caused by excessive consumption to widespread food insecurity. It is time to look back at how technology has tackled food supply-chain challenges related to quality, safety, and sustainability over the last decade. Moreover, continuous transformations of the food supply chain into a more sustainable business model with utmost resilience is the need of the hour due to COVID-19 disruptions. Method: This study aimed to systematize literature (2010-2021) in the described context and propose a future research direction, with the assistance of a systematic review and bibliometric analysis on the research agenda proposed above. Results: The findings reveal that technological Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0) tools face specific barriers due to the scope and objective of the application. Conclusion: The Internet of Things has received more attention than any other IR 4.0 tool. More integration between the specialized tools is needed to address this issue. Furthermore, the authors have proposed a food supply chain-based operational framework on technological inclusion to facilitate the roadmap for food supply chain 4.0 for more resilience and food supply chain viability.

TI Benefit Optimization of Short Food Supply Chains for Organic Products: A
   Simulation-Based Approach
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application
   The method herein can be useful for supply chain managers, leaders, and individual units. The paper concisely demonstrates simulation modeling as an evaluative tool for stochastic systems, which facilitates the ability to obtain performance measurement estimates under any given system configuration of short food supply chains (SFSCs).
   Abstract Creating alternative supply chains can help increase economic and social benefits for all beneficiaries of the supply chain. Alternative short supply chains for organic products are considered when seeking optimal scenarios to obtain the highest profit for producers, with maximizing profit being one of the main reasons for taking up business within this type of supply chain strategy. The aim of this study was to clarify the ideas of short food supply chains (SFSCs) and the organic production of food products and to indicate how economic benefits can be achieved in individual markets. The identified research gaps include the lack of a strong theoretical basis, as well as the lack of empirical studies concerning the multi-objective optimization of the economic effects of producers using computer simulation methods. However, the aim of this research was to identify the activities within such structures that can produce economic effects and influence the competences and soft relationships between the organizations participating in the chains. The adopted research methods included a critical analysis of the literature and the use of information technology tools and computer simulation. We found that computer simulation methods can lead to better decisions (to increase manufacturer benefits) regarding how to service selected markets within the SFSC. The most important limitations are the small territorial scope of the research and the consideration of only three of the most frequently purchased and manufactured products in Poland. This study was a pilot study, which will be developed further by the authors, from both a territorial and product point of view.

TI Sustainable Traceability in the Food Supply Chain: The Impact of
   Consumer Willingness to Pay
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This article addresses the sustainable traceability issue in the food supply chain from the sourcing perspective in which consumer willingness to pay for traceability is considered. There are two supplier types: traceable suppliers, which are costly but can carry a precise recall in food safety events, and non-traceable suppliers, which are less expensive but may suffer a higher cost in food safety events. A portion of consumers display traceability consciousness, and are willing to pay a premium for traceable food products. Four possible strategies in a transparent food supply chain and three sourcing strategies in a nontransparent food supply chain are identified and we determine when each strategy is optimal. We show that efforts to improve traceability that focus on consumers, by increasing their willingness to pay for traceability or expanding the portion of traceability consciousness consumers, may lead to an unintended consequence, such as a decrease in the provision of traceable food products. However, efforts that focus on revealing and penalizing the buyer always lead to a higher provision of traceable food products. We further find that efforts focusing on eliminating the information asymmetry may not be helpful for sustainable traceability in the food supply chain.

AB Several studies have been conducted regarding the optimal design of bioethanol supply chains considering economic aspects. However, biofuels were targeted to be more sustainable than traditional fossil fuels. In order to achieve that goal a sustainable supply chain needs to be achieved and therefore environmental impacts should be considered as an optimization objective. The aim of this work is to analyze the influence of including different Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods in the optimization model, namely Recipe, Eco-Indicator 99 and Impact2002+. Conclusions will be drawn regarding the influence of the LCA methods in the final optimized network structure and in the correspondent economic results obtained for the final network structure of the bioethanol's supply chain.

TI The value chain of the white fish industry in Norway: History, current
   status and possibilities for improvement - A review
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Inadequate utilization of available food resources constitutes a major problem regarding the growing population, the increased demand for food and the current need to reduce the global footprint exerted on the planet. Understanding value chains, identifying pressure points and room for improvement using new technological solutions, are important steps to enhance raw material utilization for the individual industries. Marine resources generated from the fish industry is an important part of the Norwegian food production and contributes about 4% to mainland gross domestic product. The most important industries are Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, and wild capture of pelagic fish, cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens). Processing to saleable products, mainly fillets, generates large amounts of marine rest raw material. Logistics of aquaculture production and processing allow for close to 100% utilization, while only 44% of the white fish rest raw material is being utilized. Farming of fish close to shore enable processing of rest raw material immediately after slaughter, which is paramount to avoid deterioration. Cod and Saithe are mainly caught at sea by sea trawlers and the coastal fleet, with on-board handling and transportation to shore being hurdles to overcome for processing of rest raw material to high quality products for human consumption and animal feed. This review will focus on the value chain of the white fish industry in Norway, its history, current status and possibilities of improvement to better utilize rest raw material. (C) 2020 The Authors.

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB This study explored the impact of interactional justice on supply-chain collaboration and sustainable supply-chain performance. Accordingly, it classified interactional justice of supply-chain management (SCM) into interpersonal and informational justice, and empirically classified the effects of these subordinate concepts on supply-chain collaboration and sustainable supply-chain performance. To this end, 700 questionnaires were distributed, and 201 final valid responses were used for the statistical analysis which revealed the significant positive influence of interpersonal justice on informational justice. This indicates that courtesy, respect, and proper words are important in the relationship between buyers and sellers. Both interpersonal and informational justice had a significant positive relationship with supply-chain collaboration. The results suggest that a fair-trade environment should be cultivated to encourage and facilitate seller-buyer collaboration. Lastly, supply-chain collaboration had a positive influence on sustainable supply-chain performance. This implies that if justice is not perceived in the seller-buyer relationship, collaboration can be hindered, which negatively impacts corporate performance. These findings also helped to understand the importance of interactional justice and to propose a new relationship between interpersonal and informational justice.

TI From green buildings to green supply chains An integrated input-output
   life cycle assessment and optimization framework for carbon footprint
   reduction policy making
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on tracing GHG emissions across the supply chain industries associated with the US residential, commercial and industrial building stock and provides optimized GHG reduction policy plans for sustainable development.
   Design/methodology/approach - A two-step hierarchical approach is developed. First, Economic Input-Output-based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) is utilized to quantify the GHG emissions associated with the US residential, commercial and industrial building stock. Second, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based optimization framework is developed to identify the optimal GHG emissions' reduction (percent) for each industry across the supply chain network of the US economy.
   Findings - The results indicated that "ready-mix concrete manufacturing", "electric power generation, transmission and distribution" and "lighting fixture manufacturing" sectors were found to be the main culprits in the GHG emissions' stock. Additionally, the majorly responsible industries in the supply chains of each building construction categories were also highlighted as the hot-spots in the supply chains with respect to the GHG emission reduction (percent) requirements.
   Practical implications - The decision making in terms of construction-related expenses and energy use options have considerable impacts across the supply chains. Therefore, regulations and actions should be re-organized around the systematic understanding considering the principles of "circular economy" within the context of sustainable development.
   Originality/value - Although the literature is abundant with works that address quantifying environmental impacts of building structures, environmental life cycle impact-based optimization methods are scarce. This paper successfully fills this gap by integrating EIO-LCA and MILP frameworks to identify the most pollutant industries in the supply chains of building structures.

TI Scenario analysis of smart, sustainable supply chain on the basis of a
   fuzzy cognitive map
SO MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to present a smart, sustainable supply chain practices structure on the basis of the relational view.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A method based on fuzzy cognitive map was applied to construct a relational map to introduce and implement such relational methods. Considering this relational map as a guideline, observations into particular methods and ways of applying relational methods to attain sustainable development goals across organizations has been introduced.
   Findings
   Primary outcomes provided a series of relational methods for the purpose of giving advice to those organizations and their suppliers for smart, sustainable supply chain. Reliance between relational methods were examined and assessed under seven meaningful groups: economic internet of things (IoT), green internet of things, social internet of things, economic supply chain, green supply chain, social supply chain and other variables.
   Practical implications - This study guides managers toward an improved perception of the connection among IoT instances and sustainable supply to modeling smart, sustainable supply chain. Managers can determine the practices that need more focus along with the practices that are less relevant. Thus, this will help managers in the decision-making process and to organize their decisions by planning and calculating the relative importance and influence of smart, sustainable practices on each other and on the company's smart, sustainable program.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first approach that promptly examines and determines the interdependencies between relational methods and constructs a relational map for the purpose to introduce and analyze smart, sustainable supply chain.

TI Integrating product design and supply chain management for a circular
   economy
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB Circular economy (CE) provides an alternative development model to the dominant take-make-dispose linear approach, and thus a new vision for solving sustainability challenges. Firms need to operationalise CE in their supply chain operations, starting from circular product design as the foundational step. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to integrate product design and supply chain management (SCM) decisions for a CE transition. A thematic analysis was conducted on data collected from 15 semi-structured interviews in New Zealand. Four propositions were established based on the identified themes, namely, end-of-life thinking in product design, circular SCM, business model innovation, and sustainable organisational values. The study results provide a novel insight into the integration of product design and SCM for a CE transition. The operational framework developed provides guidance to product designers, managers, and researchers to advance the CE cause at the supply chain level.

TI Jumping the Chain: How Downstream Manufacturers Engage with Deep
   Suppliers of Conflict Minerals
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB Global manufacturing firms are engaging distant suppliers of critical raw materials to participate in responsible sourcing. Downstream firms are concerned about risks in mineral supply chains of violent conflict, human rights violations, and poor governance, but they are limited in seeing their suppliers. Descriptive data on 323 smelters and refiners of tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (the "conflict minerals") were complemented by interviews with downstream firms in the electronics industry. Results provided a narrative of supplier engagement, describing tactics used to identify "deep suppliers" at chokepoints in metals supply and to persuade producers into joining due diligence programs. Top-tier firms collaborate through a standards program to overcame barriers of geography and cultural distance in supply chain management beyond the visible horizon. Curiously, manufacturers do not need line-of-sight transparency to lower-tier suppliers. Rather, top-tier firms are "jumping the chain" to engage directly with "deep suppliers" who may-or may not-be their own actual physical suppliers. The research contributes empirical evidence to understanding multi-tier supply chains, examines how power is exercised by top-tier firms managing suppliers, and provides insights on supply chain transparency. Responsible sourcing, based on due diligence guidance and standards, is becoming expected of companies that are involved in supply chains of raw materials.

TI Passive house vs. passive design: sociotechnical issues in a
   practice-based design research project for a low-energy house
SO ARCHITECTURAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Building performance simulation tools such as the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) can be invaluable for improving energy-efficiency in housing design. However, achieving improved energy performance is also a sociotechnical issue, and how this is dealt with during the architectural design process seems less well studied. This collaborative design research project for a low-energy prefab house with an industry partner, a manufacturer of Structural Insulated Panels (SIP), is used as a case study to show that it is possible to achieve high energy performance while addressing specific socio-technical concerns within an Australian volume homebuilding market. A key issue that emerged in this project was the perceived tension between passive design expectations in Australia and those promoted through the Passive House software tool.

TI The impact of leanness on supply chain sustainability: examining the
   role of sustainability control systems
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB Purpose
   An alignment between financial and operational measures is an essential element to capture the lean productivity improvements enabling supply chain sustainability. With the aim of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in addressing corporate sustainability challenges, this study aims to examine the impact of leanness on supply chain sustainability, and the moderating role of sustainability control systems (SCS) on the relationship between leanness and supply chain sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Drawing on lean manufacturing and the levers of control framework, survey data was collected from 106 manufacturing SMEs in Sri Lanka. Moderated multiple regression analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses.
   Findings
   The study finds that lean manufacturing practices, such as just-in-time deliveries, quality management, environmental management and employee involvement show a significant positive impact on supply chain sustainability. As proposed, the interactive use of SCS shows a significant, positive moderating impact on the relationship between employee involvement and social supply chain sustainability. The diagnostic use of SCS negatively moderates the relationships between just-in-time deliveries and economic supply chain sustainability, and environmental management and economic supply chain sustainability. However, both interactive and diagnostic uses of SCS do not show any significant moderating impact between lean manufacturing and environmental supply chain sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications
   The following limitations should be taken into account in interpreting the results and implications of this study. Firstly, the study refers to supply chain sustainability as environmental, social and economic sustainability. As these concepts represent broader perspectives of sustainability, and no consensus on how to measure has yet been agreed, future studies may focus on other variables that might capture different perspectives of supply chain sustainability. Secondy, future researchers may further extend the role of SCS (including all four control systems - belief, boundary, interactive and diagnostic) in examining the impact of leanness on supply chain sustainability. Thirdly, this study has considered a sample of manufacturing SMEs in the Western province in Sri Lanka. The results should be carefully generalised to other manufacturing organisations in Sri Lanka and beyond. Finally, future studies may also investigate the impact of leanness on supply chain sustainability by using alternative methodologies, such as multiple case studies.
   Originality/value
   SMEs are more likely to focus on diagnostic control systems with the aim of promoting economic supply chain sustainability. However, the findings reveal that manufacturing SMEs in the developing country context lack strong SCS to enable supply chain sustainability.

TI Uncertain Network DEA Models with Imprecise Data for Sustainable
   Efficiency Evaluation of Decentralized Marine Supply Chain
SO ENERGIES
AB With the expansion of global trade and the deterioration of the marine environment, research on the sustainability of marine transport has drawn increasing scientific attention. This study takes the marine supply chain composed of Maersk and ports in 17 coastal cities in China as decision-making units (DMUs). It then chooses indicators from the three dimensions of economy, environment and society to evaluate the sustainable efficiency of the marine supply chain, Maersk and ports. In order to deal with the uncertain variables of the sustainability evaluation index, this study develops an uncertain network DEA model based on the uncertainty theory, and the computable equivalent form and proof are also provided. In addition, this study divides the decentralized marine supply chain into two modes, i.e., Maersk as leader and the port as leader, and it calculates their sustainable efficiency, respectively. These results suggest that the sustainable performance of ports is superior to that of Maersk, and the sustainable performance of the marine supply chain is better under the lead of ports, but most of the sustainable efficiencies of marine supply chains are inefficient. Therefore, ports should act as a catalyst for the development of the marine supply chain, and the management implications and suggestions for the economic, environmental, and social dimensions are also outlined at the conclusion.

TI Emancipatory technology and developing-world supply chains: A case study
   of African women gemstone miners
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) make up roughly 90% of the colored gemstone trade, a still untamed industry where money laundering, cartels, arms purchases, and crime run rampant while many miners prospect and dream of finding "the big one." Women make up to 30% to 50% of ASM, often in developing regions. Struggling to make a living and support their families, women miners are subject to discrimination, unfair labor practices, and poor access to rich foreign markets. Grounded in a longitudinal case study in Africa, this qualitative research examines the journey of an organization seeking to emancipate women miners through supply chains that embrace technology, provenance, and disintermediation. This research demonstrates the strategic value of emancipatory technologies for firms. Secondly, we find evidence that combinations of storytelling and digital records create multidimensional provenance that mitigates a number of supply chain risks, particularly in tainted chains. Lastly, this research extends Tang's framework for engaging marginalized populations as suppliers and producers.

TI WHY RESEARCH IN SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SHOULD HAVE NO
   FUTURE
SO JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB In the last two decades, the topic of sustainability has moved from the fringes of supply chain management research to the mainstream and is now an area of significant research activity. In this paper, we argue that while this increase in acceptance and activity is welcome and has lead to a greater understanding of sustainability, our present knowledge is not sufficient to create truly sustainable supply chains. We build on this insight to identify five main issues that future research needs to address. We argue that when it comes to the theory of sustainable supply chain management, previous research has focused on the synergistic and familiar while overlooking trade-offs and radical innovation. These theoretical issues are compounded by measures that do not truly capture a supply chain's impacts and methods that are better at looking backwards than forwards. The paper concludes by proposing a series of recommendations that address these issues to help in the development of truly sustainable supply chains.

TI Characteristics of decision process towards circular food economy: A
   review
SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB The agri-food supply chain has unique characteristics, such as perishability, high product differentiation, and safety requirements, which results in one-third of its production being lost and wasted. The chain is also responsible for emitting annually the equivalent of 3.6 gigatons of CO2. Recently, the circular economy has experienced advances in non-perishable products, and the agri-food system has been studied mainly through conceptual research. In contrast to other supply chains, there are conditions in the agri-food supply chain that stakeholders are unable or reluctant to explore when adopting circular alternatives. For instance, the costs involved in food recovery and reuse, market advantages, regulations, and education are relevant to incentivizing holistic sustainability in the agri-food sector. However, few studies have focused on the adoption of circularity in this chain as a complex system. The decisions, incentives, and obstacles relevant to adopting circular alternatives within and between echelons, and why, when, and how stakeholders made them, have not been directly analyzed. In this context, a systematic review of existing circular economy publications within the agri-food supply chain domain was conducted and is discussed in this review with two aims: (1) to establish the fron-tiers of studies related to circularity adoption by the chain, referred to as the circular food economy (CFE), so as to understand the characteristics of the decision-making process of the different stakeholders of the chain; and (2) to summarize the barriers and drivers mentioned in the literature, including discussing their impacts on what, why, who, and how decisions to adopt CFE are currently made. The results showed the complexity of studying circularity in agri-food supply chains and revealed that food loss and waste, cost-efficiency alternatives, policy -making, information and communication technologies, customer preferences, stakeholder cooperation in-centives, and industry-academia-government collaboration are key aspects of the decision-making process. Po-tential future studies within this domain are also discussed.

TI Interaction among Information Sharing, Supply Chain Structure and
   Performance
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The uncertainty of external environment is an important factor affecting the performance of supply chain, while information sharing and supply chain structure optimization are important means to reduce uncertainty and improve supply chain performance. From the perspective of decision-making and global optimization, a mathematical model on the interaction among environmental uncertainty, supply chain structure, information sharing and supply chain performance was established. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, this paper explores the influence of environmental uncertainty, information distortion and information cost on supply chain structure design and supply chain performance, and analyzed the influence of information sharing on supply chain performance. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the role of information sharing in supply chain management, reasonably grasping the level of information sharing and optimizing the supply chain structure in uncertain environment. The comparison with the classical bullwhip effect research was made, which provides a new perspective and supplement for understanding and slowing down the bullwhip effect.

SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB PurposeThe novel COVID-19 supply chain disruption has globally altered the environmental needs of society. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to examine how top managers are environmentally committed to integrating green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in the operational performance of small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana, within the post-pandemic economy. Design/methodology/approachThe study used a cross-sectional survey to obtain data from 270 SMEs in Ghana, using partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling to test seven hypothesized relationships. FindingsThe outcome of the analysis revealed that top management environmental commitment has a significantly positive effect on supply chain operational performance. The structural model also revealed that top management environmental commitment has a positive and significant effect on both internal and external GSCM practices. The results further revealed that both internal and external GSCM practices have positive and significant effects on supply chain operational performance. Finally, both internal and external GSCM practices mediate the path between top management environmental commitment and supply chain operational performance. Research limitations/implicationsThe study provides a novel framework which contributes to both theoretical studies and managerial decisions on COVID-19 related supply chain management issues. However, the study was limited to the Ghanaian context, thus, further related studies are required in other contexts. Originality/valueThis study provides a novel framework by elucidating the intervening role of GSCM practices in the path between top management environmental commitment and supply chain operations in an emerging post-pandemic world context.

TI Sustainable supply chain management: a case study at IKEA
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB While sustainability is central to research on supply chains, there has been relatively little research on diversity and impact on supply chain sustainability performance. Such practices, also called sustainable plans, are the ones that improve not only supply chain economic performance, but also their environmental and social performances. Stakeholders are increasingly exerting pressure on organisations to adopt sustainable practices within their firm and across their supply chain. This one case pilot study explores the extent to which IKEA has successfully integrated sustainability practices into the management of the supply chain. We analyse sustainability practices using data gathered from IKEA as a global case study. Our research findings reveal that sustainability practices can be successfully implemented across an organisation's entire supply chain, including second and third tier suppliers to gain positive environmental and social impacts while still promoting a strong economic bottom line. The article wraps up with a general discussion, limitations, as well as opportunities for future research, and lastly with concluding remarks.

SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB With the tremendous increase in the globalization of trade the corresponding supply chains supporting the manufacture, distribution and supply of goods has become extremely complex. Intelligent agents can help with the problem of effective management of these complex supply chains. In this paper we introduce the design, implementation and testing of an intelligent agent for handling procurement, customer sales, and scheduling of production in a stylized supply chain environment. The supply chain environment used in this paper is modeled after the trading agent competition that is held annually to choose the best agent for managing a supply chain. Our supply chain agent, which we call SCMaster, uses dynamic inventory control and various reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning, Softmax, epsilon-greedy, and sliding window protocol to make our agent adapt dynamically to the changing environment created by competing agents. A multi-agent simulation environment is developed in Java to test the efficacy of our agent design. Two competing agents are created modeled after the winners of past trading agent competitions and are tested against our agent in various experimental designs. Results of simulations show that our agent has better performance compared to the other agents.

TI A multi-stage supply chain disruption mitigation strategy considering
   product life cycle during COVID-19
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The global pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe damage to the supply chain such that manufacturers may face long-term supply disruptions. In this paper, a disruption recovery strategy of a supply chain system is investigated from the perspective of product change, in which the life cycle and design change time of a new product are both considered in order to minimize the losses of manufacturer after disruptions. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented to address the disruption recovery problem for this multi-period, multi-supplier, and multi-stage supply chain system. A two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Experimental results show that the proposed disruption mitigation strategy can effectively reduce the profit loss of manufacturer due to supply disruption, and demonstrate the impact of product life cycle in the selection of new product design planning. A sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure the applicability of the model in the actual environment, which illustrates the effect of different parameter changes on the results. This work can help manufacturers establish an optimal recovery strategy whenever the supply chain system experiences supply disruptions.

SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Due to various environmental problems and social impacts caused by biomass supply chains activities such as climate change, increasing energy demand, energy security, and food crisis, on the one hand, and economic issues such as high costs of biomass supply chains logistics activities, and inefficient production of bioenergy products from low-energy density biomass, on the other hand, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have transitioned to a growing area of research in a recent decade. In this perspective, evaluating three aspects of sustainablity, including economic, environmental, and social sustainability, as the main characteristic to review the literature of supply chain design and planning models has been the subject of several review studies, however, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have not been reviewed and analysed so far. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a taxonomic review of biomass to bioproducts supply chains design and planning models that evaluate or optimize economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. To this aim, a total number of 178 papers published in scientific journals are categorized and analyzed according to a comprehensive classification framework, including sustainability dimensions, decision level, modeling approach, model characteristic, solution approach, uncertainty modeling approach, and data. Some significant factors ignored in the previous studies such as sustainability aspects, transportation modes, by-products, type of biomass feedstocks, international and governmental factors are considered in this review in order to provide a comprehensive vision for the readers. Finally, the drawbacks and research gaps that have been identified through the literature review are highlighted, and potential directions for future studies are recommended.

TI Alleviating Financing Constraints of SMEs through Supply Chain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Small and medium-sized enterprises play a crucial role in sustaining economic development in both developed economies and developing economies, however, many of them suffer from chronic and structural difficulties in accessing external financing. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to illustrate how information structures work in the strategic interactions between banks and firms in a supply chain, and why the transaction information in a supply chain may serve to reduce information asymmetry and improve SMEs' access to external financing. We find that under incomplete information, the transactions between SMEs and suppliers can serve as signals for banks, which may help banks access the private information of SMEs, thus reducing information asymmetry between them. To maximize profit, banks should dynamically adjust both their interest rate policies and risk management strategies when providing financing services to SMEs, according to the structure of the financial market. The improvement of the external financial environment for SMEs may benefit the entire supply chain, thus facilitating its sustainable development and the growth of SMEs. Our framework sheds light on how SMEs in a supply chain may enhance their survivability and facilitate their development through appropriate strategies to improve business performances and manage credit risks.

TI Additive manufacturing technology in spare parts supply chain: a
   comparative study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology has the potential to significantly improve supply chain dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of AM on spare parts supply chain. Three supply chain scenarios are investigated in this paper, namely conventional supply chain, centralised AM-based supply chain and distributed AM-based supply chain. Based on system dynamics simulations, this paper specifically compares three supply chain scenarios, in terms of total variable cost and carbon emission. The results show the spare part supply chain utilising AM is indeed superior to the traditional one in sustainable performance. It is also expected that AM can facilitate the spare parts supply chain to achieve more economic benefits along with its development. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the early studies that explores the impact of AM on supply chain performance and quantitatively examines the superiority of utilising AM in spare parts supply chain. Some suggestions are also provided to help managers adopting AM in their spare parts supply chains.
