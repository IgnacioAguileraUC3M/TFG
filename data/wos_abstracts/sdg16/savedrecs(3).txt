TI Does Globalization Breed Ethnic Discontent?
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This article examines how different components of globalization affect the death toll from internal armed conflict. Conventional wisdom once held that the severity of internal conflict would gradually decline with the spread of globalization, but fatalities still remain high. Moreover, leading theories of civil war sharply disagree about how different aspects of globalization might affect the severity of ethnic and nonethnic armed conflicts. Using arguments from a variety of social science perspectives on globalization, civil war, and ethnic conflict to guide the analysis, this article finds that (1) economic globalization and cultural globalization significantly increase fatalities from ethnic conflicts, supporting arguments from ethnic competition and world-polity perspectives, (2) sociotechnical aspects of globalization increase deaths from ethnic conflict but decrease deaths from nonethnic conflict, and (3) regime corruption increases fatalities from nonethnic conflict, which supports explanations suggesting that the severity of civil war is greater in weak and corrupt states.

TI Intrastate peace agreements and the durability of peace
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB The article debunks the conception that peace agreements are all equal. Distinct from the conventional monocausal assessment, I view the peace agreement as a cohesive whole and evaluate its strength in terms of its structural and procedural provisions. I use data on the length of intrastate peace episodes during the period from 1946 to 2010. My key finding is that the design quality of the peace agreement has a significant impact on the durability of peace. Agreements that are carefully designed to deal with all obstacles to cooperation have the strongest pacifying effect among armed conflict outcomes. The article sets forth ways to sharpen the performance of conflict management operations in war-torn countries.

TI Extremism, moderation and post-conflict democratic governance: the
   FARC-EP and the FMLN in a comparative perspective
SO AMERICA LATINA HOY-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
AB Why is it that the FMLN and the Salvadorian government, after twelve years of Civil War, succeeded in negotiating a peace accord in less than two years while the FARC-EP and the Colombian government are unable to consolidate a cease-fire after forty-six years of internal armed conflict? It's argued that the belligerents extremism or moderation is a key to the answer. Aversion to political uncertainty acts as an incentive for "moderated guerrillas" (such as the FMLN), which are willing to negotiate pacts establishing liberal democratic institutions, capable of peacefully managing social conflicts, and strengthening post-conflict governance. Insensitivity to political uncertainty, the incapacity to change strategies, and the definition of survival as a permanent access to the decision-making processes explain why extremist guerrillas (such as the FARC-EP) have a tendency to seek power-sharing arrangements, which soon become an obstacle to post-conflict governance. Conflict resolution scholars and custodians of peace should consider the analysis of the balance of power between extremist and moderated actors (before the beginning of a peace negotiation process) as a fundamental step when identifying the obstacles to sustainable peace and post-conflict governance.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB The Terrorism in Armed Conflict project integrates the Uppsala Conflict Data Project sample of rebel organizations with START's Global Terrorism Database, covering 409 organizations for 1970-2013. For many Global Terrorism Database incidents, perpetrator information is missing, or ambiguous. Because the accuracy of perpetrator information likely varies systematically, simply dropping these incidents from analyses may bias results. Terrorism in Armed Conflict provides possible attribution to specific rebel groups with coding for uncertainty, enabling researchers to (1) address "description bias" in media-based terrorism data, (2) model uncertainty regarding perpetrator attribution and (3) vary the way terrorism is counted. The Terrorism in Armed Conflict dataset further provides a measure of deliberately indiscriminate terrorism that allows for more nuanced testing of arguments about the strategic logic of terrorism.

TI Putting violent armed conflict in the center of the Salween hydropower
   debates
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
AB Regional economic integration has become the dominant development pathway promoted, endorsed, and followed by many developing country governments in South East Asia and globally. Focusing on hydropower development, this article shows how forces of globalization manifested in the Myanmar government's strategies to promote economic growth are shaping the Salween River basin's development trajectory. Contesting the general belief that economic development would help the country's transition to full democracy and achieve peace, it illustrates how hydropower development plans in the basin are closely interlinked with human rights issues. Well known for its long histories of violent conflict involving the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups in various states, hydropower development in the Salween River is not only linked to the ongoing peace process in Myanmar but could also have direct implications on the actual significance of the process. Despite the signing of nationwide ceasefire agreements in 2012, hydropower dam projects could contribute to and trigger reoccurrences of violent armed conflict. Recognizing this conflict-prone and politically fragile condition as the main characteristics of Salween water governance is essential if we are to strive for sustainable and just development.

Since 2000, there has been a burst of positivist gender/IR scholarship, much of it quantitative. This work has addressed several important areas in IR, including terrorism, interstate war, human rights, civil war, violence against civilians, public opinion, international norms, globalization, and others. Much of this work has developed new data, advanced theory, and employed rigorous empirical methods. This article surveys this positivist scholarship. It discusses how positivist and nonpositivist gender/IR work complement each other. This article makes recommendations about directions for future scholarship on gender and IR.

TI Discrimination in post-conflict settings: Experimental evidence from
   Colombia
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB After a civil war, community support for the reintegration of ex-combatants is crucial for peace-building. Using a crowdfunding campaign to promote trainees' business ideas, we investigate whether university students discriminate against ex-combatants in Colombia. Our results show that there is no discrimination against ex-combatants in terms of donations compared with other trainees, but there is a substantial degree of prejudice and skepticism. This finding suggests that the reintegration of ex-combatants might be affected by the NIMBY phenomena. Although willing to economically support the peace process, individuals are skeptical towards personal encounters with ex-combatants. This suggest that to achieve sustainable peace, policies should focus on decreasing stigmatization towards ex-combatants. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Peace Negotiations in Civil Conflicts: A New Dataset
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This article introduces the Peace Negotiations in Civil Conflicts (PNCC) dataset, which identifies whether a state-party and rival non-state armed group is in the formal negotiation phase of a peace process. The PNCC goes beyond recording instances of peace talks by offering a conceptual framework to identify when a government-rebel group dyad is at risk of formal negotiations. It explicitly considers issues central in event-history modelling, including censoring and the observation period. The PNCC also provides detailed information on negotiations, including the date and location of peace talks, and whether negotiations were bilateral or through mediation. The PNCC is the first source to distinguish mediated and non-mediated civil conflict negotiations under a single framework. Structured over the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset with global coverage for 1975-2013, the PNCC is integrable to commonly used civil war datasets.

TI Post-civil war democratization: promotion of democracy in post-civil war
   states, 1946-2005
SO DEMOCRATIZATION
AB Post-civil war democratization is a critical element of building sustainable peace in post-civil war states. Yet studies of democratic transition and survival suggest that the post-civil war environment is not hospitable to either the transition toward or the survival of democracy. This inhospitality may be due to the fact that post-civil war environments are contentious. After a civil war, the former protagonists fear for their security and also want to protect their political and economic interests. The central argument of this study is that former rivals can agree to a transition toward democracy to the extent that a stable balance of power exists between the government and rebel groups; a balance that eliminates the sort of security dilemma that would encourage one or both parties to resume armed conflict. Such a balance should ensure access to political power and economic resources. This study identifies factors that contribute to the establishment of a balance of power between former protagonists and factors that affect its stability. The presence of these factors should affect the decision of former protagonists on whether or not they can achieve their political and economic interests if they agree to a transition toward democracy once the civil war ends. Based on this theoretical argument, I have derived empirically testable hypotheses. In the survival analysis performed, I find support for the theoretical arguments. The findings of this study have some policy implications.

TI The State, the assailant? Guaranteeing economic and social rights after
   widespread violence through the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
SO NETHERLANDS QUARTERLY OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AB The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has traditionally addressed the socio-economic wrongs that result from episodes of widespread violence indirectly, under the lens of civil and political rights abuses. This article provides a historical explanation of this approach and expands on the limitations that follow from it in the Court's jurisprudence. Using empirical data on victims and perpetrators in countries affected by armed conflict and organised crime, the article measures the magnitude of these limitations. To overcome them, it suggests that the right to a 'dignified life' and recent developments concerning the enforceability of economic and social rights be applied after widespread violence, following the lead of the Colombian Constitutional Court regarding the protection of internally displaced people by violence.

TI UN involvement and civil war peace agreement implementation
SO PUBLIC CHOICE
AB Many studies argue that third-party guarantees, such as those of the United Nations, increase the chances that belligerents will sign peace agreements, but it is unclear how third-party involvement affects the implementation of such agreements. We unpack the relationship between UN involvement and peace agreement success by focusing on the risk of defections during the peace accord implementation phase. We argue that two types of commitment problems, namely involuntary and voluntary defections, emerge from the characteristics of the peace process itself as well as from new opportunities available to rebel groups. We expect that shifts in relative power and polarized voting lead to lower implementation scores overall, but that the deployment of UN troops has a mitigating effect, thereby increasing the prospects of sustainable peace agreements. Using data from the Peace Accords Matrix Implementation Dataset from 1989 to 2010 and personnel commitments to UN peacekeeping operations, we find evidence that large UN missions are better placed to support the implementation and longevity of the peace process.

TI From Claims to Violence: Signaling, Outbidding, and Escalation in Ethnic
   Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Do radical political demands increase the risk of ethnic civil conflict? And why do ethnic movements make radical demands in the first place? We contend that when movements are fragmented, individual organizations use far-reaching claims relative to the status quo to attract attention from the government, boost intra-organizational discipline, and outbid rivals. Yet, such radical claims also increase the risk of conflict escalation. We test our arguments at both the ethnic group and organizational levels, using a new dataset on ethno-political organizations and their political demands. Our results show that the scope of demands increases the more organizations exist within an ethnic movement and that radical demands increase the risk of civil conflict onset. This effect is specific to the dyadic government-movement interaction, irrespective of other ethnic groups in the country. Moreover, at the organizational level, radicalization in demands increases the likelihood that an organization becomes engaged in civil conflict.

TI What is Right and What is Wrong in the Environmental Governance Model?
   Environmental Regulations for Improving Environmental Sustainability
   Ratings
SO PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU
AB The improper allocation of economic and environmental resources damages the United Nations sustainable development Agenda, which remains a challenge for policymakers to stop the rot through efficient governance mechanisms. The study designed an efficient environmental governance framework by extending the different governance factors linked to the environmental sustainability ratings in the cross-section of 67 countries. The results of the two-regime based estimator show that environmental corruption (regime-1), environmental politics (regime 2), and environmental laws (regime-2) negatively correlated with the environmental sustainability rating, whereas environmental democracy (regime-1 & 2) positively correlated with the environmental sustainability agenda across countries. The government effectiveness and the country's per capita income both escalates environmental sustain ability ratings. The results align with the Demopolis theory, the effective regulatory theory, and the theory of law and politics. The causality estimates show that environmental corruption and government effectiveness causes environmental politics and economic growth. In contrast, environmental democracy and environmental regulations cause a country's per capita income. The bidirectional causality is found between environmental regulations and environmental corruption on the one hand, while environmental regulations and environmental politics Granger cause each other on the other hand. The results show the importance of environmental regulations in managing ecological corruption and politics across countries. The variance decomposition analysis suggested that environmental politics likely influenced the environmental sustainability agenda, followed by government effectiveness and environmental democracy for the next ten years. The study emphasized the need to design an efficient environmental governance framework that minimizes environmental corruption and enables them to move towards environmental democracy, stringent environmental laws, and regulations. Government effectiveness would mainly be linked to reducing corruption and political instability to achieve clean, green and sustainable development.

   conflict
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB We propose a model where weak rulers have incentives to let ethnically divided countries plunge in civil war. Allowing inter-group fighting reduces production-and hence the tax base-but enables the ruler to devote more resources to increasing the tax rate. This mechanism is increasingly salient with larger amounts of natural resources, especially if these are unequally distributed across ethnic groups. We validate the theoretical predictions using cross-country data, and show that our empirical results are robust to controlling for the usual determinants of civil war incidence, and to using various proxies for the ruler's relative weakness and for the presence of natural resources.

TI Rhetoric of civil conflict management: United Nations Security Council
   debates over the Syrian civil war
SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
AB This paper introduces a spatial model of civil conflict management rhetoric to explore how the emerging norm of responsibility to protect shapes major power rhetorical responses to civil war. Using framing theory, we argue that responsibility to protect functions like a prescriptive norm, such that representing a conflict as one of (1) human rights violations (problem definition), implies rhetorical support for (2) coercive outside intervention (solution identification). These dimensions reflect the problem-solution form of a prescriptive norm. Using dictionary scaling with a dynamic model, we analyze the positions of UN Security Council members in debates over the Syrian Civil War separately for each dimension. We find that the permanent members who emphasized human rights violations also used intervention rhetoric (UK, France, and the US), and those who did not used non-intervention rhetoric (Russia and China). We conclude that, while not a fully consolidated norm, responsibility to protect appears to have structured major power rhetorical responses to the Syrian Civil War.

TI Participation(s) in Transnational Environmental Governance: Green Values

SO ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES
AB As crucial elements of green ideology, political participation and inclusiveness have become indispensable to democratic decision-making as green values gained ground across the world. It is often assumed that through the inclusion and participation of more stakeholders, the global environmental governance architecture has become increasingly democratic since the 1990s. This article asks whether civil society participation in the relevant United Nations platforms democratises transnational and global environmental governance, or simply simulates democratic participation without giving stakeholders the chance to contribute to policy decisions. First, building on Hannah Arendt's concept of political action I differentiate forms of participation based on different value systems. Then, following the historical development of participation narratives in the United Nations, I argue that participation has become increasingly instrumentalised and used to conceal other types of institutional change based on efficiency considerations and neoliberal values.

This paper introduces the Categorically Disaggregated Conflict (CDC) dataset, which categorizes conflicts based on the two most commonly used distinctions, ethnic-vs-non-ethnic and governmental-vs-territorial, resulting in four conflict categories: ethnic governmental, ethnic territorial, non-ethnic governmental and non-ethnic territorial. While not the first of its kind, the CDC contains a number of novel features. Aside from its unique conceptualization of ethnic conflict, the CDC provides coding of the key component variables (language, religion and race), allowing users to re-code ethnic/non-ethnic conflicts into several alternative lists (e.g. religious/non-religious). Furthermore, the CDC provides detailed descriptions documenting coding choices for every single conflict, allowing users to track individual coding decisions. To demonstrate the value of the CDC, this paper replicates a recent study by Cederman, Gelditsch and Buhaug, based on the ACD2EPRthe only extant alternative to the CDC. The findings of the replication analysis challenge some of the key conclusions of the original study, substantiating the need for alternative categorically disaggregated datasets.

TI The Perils of Power-Sharing: Africa and Beyond
SO AFRICA SPECTRUM
AB The purpose of international conflict-resolution efforts is, in the short term, to bring an end to violent armed conflict, and, in the medium to longer term, to prevent the revival of conflict. However, at least one of the mechanisms often utilised in conflict resolution and peace agreements, power-sharing, may not only prove problematic in early negotiation and implementation, but may potentially be at odds with the longer-term goal of preventing resurgence of conflict. Why might this be the case? Longer-term peacebuilding seeks to prevent conflict in part by building strong and sustainable states. Such states should be able to avoid reverting to armed conflict because they would be more responsive to grievances and more effective in dealing with violent dissent. However, power-sharing arrangements may undermine such efforts by placing in power individuals and groups not fully committed to, or unable to take part in, governance for the benefit of the entire populace; in part because it necessarily places in power those who have engaged in significant violence to achieve their ends. This is likely to create less democratic states, although we do not insist that democracy is or should be the only goal of peacebuilders. Rather, we suggest that power-sharing arrangements may tend not only towards undemocratic states, but towards states which are not responsive to the needs of the citizenry for security in ways which may undermine human security and state legitimacy.

TI Talking to the Shameless?: Sexual Violence and Mediation in Intrastate
   Conflicts
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB To what extent, does sexual violence influence the likelihood of conflict management in intrastate conflicts? Despite a growing body of research that explores conflict-related sexual violence, the literature presents little insight on its effects on conflict resolution. Extending feminist international relations (IR) theory to intrastate conflicts and applying a gender lens to the power to hurt argument, I argue that when rebel sexual violence is public knowledge, the likelihood of conflict management increases because the state perceives it as a threat to its masculinity. I systematically test this argument on all intrastate conflict years from 1990 to 2009 using the Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict and the Civil War Mediation data set. The results provide robust support for the argument. This presents an important refinement of traditional rationalist conflict bargaining theories and opens new avenues for the research and practice of conflict management.

The peace building process has led to sustainable peace in a country located in a highly conflict ridden region in the world. This paper analyzes the peacemaking process to understand the process and its underlying unique features. Placing the events in the context of peacemaking criminology and human rights, it is argued that the UN peacemaking greatly reflects the values advocated by peacemaking criminology, while the goals of the process reflect universal human rights, recognized and promoted by the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

TI Environmental governance and the green economy
SO CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
AB The Rio+20 Conference will mobilize the global community in 2012 to participate in a challenging debate on the global environmental reality and the existing modus operandi with respect to the broad and generic topics of development and the environment. One of the core themes of this meeting is the transition to a green economy in the context of sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. The issue of Global Environmental Governance will top the agenda of the Rio +20 discussions, with a view to promoting and accelerating the transition to sustainable societies. It presents, often in a controversial way, the creation of conditions to define new institutional spaces and shared decision-making processes. Before embarking on the discussion about what king of sustainability should be behind the Green Economy, and its applicability, the scope of this article is to ask readers to reflect on what should be the priority in the discussion on environmental governance This should be explained to the extent that there is a need to change the existing mechanisms of profoundly unequal exploitation of resources, which blocks progress in decision-making processes, as decisions of the few create a perverse logic of appropriation of natural resources and the non-resolution of social exclusion.

The CF data covers all ceasefires in civil conflict between 1989 and 2020, including multilateral, bilateral and unilateral arrangements, ranging from verbal arrangements to detailed written agreements. In total, the CF data includes 2202 ceasefires across 66 countries and 109 civil conflicts. The data feature information on the actors involved in the ceasefire, and the class, purpose, coverage, and end date of the ceasefire. The CF data provide an empirical basis to assess the conditions that give rise to ceasefires, how ceasefires affect the dynamics of conflict, and the role of a ceasefire in the peace process. This article presents the rationale underlying the data collection, the coding rules and procedures, and how this data can be used for analysis.

TI A rights foundation for ecological democracy
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
AB What would it mean to conceptualize some environmental relationships as bundles of rights, rather than as a good as generally defined by liberalism? Environmental rights are a category of human rights necessarily central to both democracy and global environmental protection and governance (ecological democracy). The world of democratic politics and governance since mid-twentieth century has been transformed by a rights revolution in which recognized rights have come to constitute a 'global normative order.' There are several policy spaces in which persuasive environmental rights discourses have been emerging from existing or foreseeable congruences of elite and popular environmental norms, including (1) rights involving access to information and decision-making processes; (2) rights ensuring access to food and water; and (3) rights providing environmental security to all. We analyze these three rights discourses and assess their current and necessary future trajectories. We identify next steps in achieving better understanding and more meaningful establishment of environmental rights and their integration into our thinking about human rights, with attention to how they can be reconciled with the social and cultural diversity of democratic environmental governance in coming turbulent times.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB This article argues that the spread of ethnic conflict across international borders is a result of purposive repressive state action combined with political opportunity which allows the ethnic group to mobilize in response. We test our argument using a bivariate probit model to simultaneously estimate the risk of repression escalation and the spread of ethnic conflict (1976-2009), and find that the likelihood of both increases in the presence of relatively large, territorially concentrated transnational ethnic groups, and that nationalist governments are more likely to escalate repression amidst nearby ethnic violence. Political crises also exacerbate the risk of ethnic conflict spread.

Through a chronological analysis of the peace process between 2000 and 2005, this article demonstrates that the scope for compromise was limited and that a significantly 'better' deal was unlikely. The article's ambition is to present a concise and empirically grounded analysis of the peace process and to lay foundations for further investigation of a crucial, contested and complicated subject in Sudan's recent history.

TI Costs and Cover: Explaining the Onset of Ceasefires in Civil Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Ceasefires are common in civil conflict. Yet we have surprisingly little comparative analysis of why and under what conditions they occur. A ceasefire provides temporary relief from the costs of conflict, but also generates its own costs. Building on this logic, we argue that conflict parties are more likely to accept the costs associated with a ceasefire when the conflict costs are greater, in particular, when: violence is intense; there are higher levels of 'collateral damage'; and the parties lack international support. Second, we contend that ceasefires are also more likely in those periods in which the audience costs associated with entering into an arrangement are lower, specifically, when the parties have some form of 'political cover', such as during mediation. We find support for both arguments in an analysis of a new dataset capturing all ceasefire in civil conflict from 1989-2020, using a series of dyad fixed effect models.

Indigenous, gender-specific knowledge from displaced Ghanaian women is presented in the context of feminist perspectives on the consequences of regional wars on noncombatants. The research generated indigenous material for social work education about interethnic peace building and conflict resolution. The discussion includes first-person responses about warning signs, origins of conflict, immediate and long-term responses, social consequences, and an integration of findings with feminist perspectives on conflict resolution and policies that are designed to aid internally displaced women.

SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
AB While the extant literature has highlighted the importance of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) in addressing commitment problems in civil wars, actor fragmentation presents additional challenges for conflict resolution. A higher number of competing actors not only worsens coordination problems but also aggravates the risk of opposition to a peace process, generating an environment prone to spoiler violence. This article argues that UN interventions matter more when commitment and coordination problems are worse, which corresponds to known traits of fragmented conflicts. Using data on civil conflict duration and intensity, we present evidence that UN PKOs are effective at mitigating adverse impacts of fragmentation. Fragmented conflicts are both longer and deadlier when the UN is not involved to support a peace process, while UN peacekeeping mitigates the effects of fragmentation.

TI The effects of armed conflict on the health of women and children
SO LANCET
AB Women and children bear substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of armed conflicts. This Series paper focuses on the direct (due to violence) and indirect health effects of armed conflict on women and children (including adolescents) worldwide. We estimate that nearly 36 million children and 16 million women were displaced in 2017, on the basis of international databases of refugees and internally displaced populations. From geospatial analyses we estimate that the number of non-displaced women and children living dangerously close to armed conflict (within 50 km) increased from 185 million women and 250 million children in 2000, to 265 million women and 368 million children in 2017. Women's and children's mortality risk from non-violent causes increases substantially in response to nearby conflict, with more intense and more chronic conflicts leading to greater mortality increases. More than 10 million deaths in children younger than 5 years can be attributed to conflict between 1995 and 2015 globally. Women of reproductive ages living near high intensity conflicts have three times higher mortality than do women in peaceful settings. Current research provides fragmentary evidence about how armed conflict indirectly affects the survival chances of women and children through malnutrition, physical injuries, infectious diseases, poor mental health, and poor sexual and reproductive health, but major systematic evidence is sparse, hampering the design and implementation of essential interventions for mitigating the harms of armed conflicts.

TI LIBERIA: Civil War and the Complications SALWs Proliferation
SO CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB This paper examines the complications of SALWs in the context of armed conflict with particular reference to the Liberian civil war. Using an exploratory analysis that relied on documentary data, as complemented by insights from Key Informant Interview (KII), the paper observed that the incidence of SALWs proliferation was one of the factors that complicated the Liberian crisis. The paper posits that the complications of SALWs proliferation in Liberia during and after the National crisis (1989-2003) posed a threat to the country's national security. The threat is evident in the collateral impact of armed violence that characterized the Liberian crisis as well as the wave of armed criminality that has punctuated the country's history in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of its dire effects vis-a-vis sustainable peace, security and stability, this paper submit that SALWs proliferation has posed a threat to Liberian national security both in the conflict and post-conflict eras.

TI Women's participation in peace processes: a review of literature
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE EDUCATION
AB Women play a prominent role in bringing about peace in post-conflict societies. Several studies have found the systematic and representative inclusion of women in conflict resolution processes to significantly increase the chances of sustainable peace. However, women's contribution to peace processes are often underemphasized or ignored in conflict management research and praxis. It was not until the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and seven other related resolutions that critical attention was given to women's role in the peace process. This article provides an in-depth review of the literature on women's contribution to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. The overall aim is to provide researchers and actors in the global peace market with a distillation of the salient studies and findings from research on women's involvement in the peace process. Such an effort is necessary to bring together the sparse literature on women's contribution to peace and to reveal existing gaps in the literature for future research.

TI Post-conflict health reconstruction: search for a policy
SO DISASTERS
AB Despite increasing experience in health reconstruction in societies emerging from conflict, the policy basis for investing in the development of equitable and effective health systems in the wake of war remains unsettled. 1 Consideration of post-conflict health reconstruction is almost entirely absent in donor policies on global health. Practically by default, health programmes are seen increasingly as an element of stabilisation and security interventions in the aftermath of armed conflict. That perspective, however, lacks an evidence base and can skew health programmes towards short-term security and stabilisation goals that have a marginal impact and violate the principles of equity, non-discrimination, and quality, which are central to sound health systems and public acceptance of them. A better approach is to ground policy in legitimacy, viewing health both as a core social institution and one that, if developed according to human rights principles, including equity, non-discrimination, participation and accountability, can advance the effectiveness and the quality of governance in the emerging state.

TI Democratizing Regional Environmental Governance: Public Deliberation and
   Participation in Transboundary Ecoregions
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Over the last two decades, transboundary regional environmental governance has witnessed some institutional change through an increasing shift from intergovernmentally constituted political institutions to new complex structures of decision-making where policy-making has begun to adapt to a new, more active role of societal actors at multiple levels of political authority. In addressing this issue, the article raises the following questions: How can new structures and processes of public deliberation and participation in transboundary regional environmental governance be designed, and which opportunities and risks emerge? To address these questions, the article develops a normative-analytical design for regional environmental governance in ecoregions; this design defines the conditions under which public deliberation and participation conveying discourse, argument, and persuasion can help to democratize collective decision-making.

TI Internally Displaced "Victims of Armed Conflict" in Colombia: The
   Trajectory and Trauma Signature of Forced Migration
SO CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
AB While conflict-induced forced migration is a global phenomenon, the situation in Colombia, South America, is distinctive. Colombia has ranked either first or second in the number of internally displaced persons for 10 years, a consequence of decades of armed conflict compounded by high prevalence of drug trafficking. The displacement trajectory for displaced persons in Colombia proceeds through a sequence of stages: (1) pre-expulsion threats and vulnerability, (2) expulsion, (3) migration, (4) initial adaptation to relocation, (5) protracted resettlement (the end point for most forced migrants), and, rarely, (6) return to the community of origin. Trauma signature analysis, an evidence-based method that elucidates the physical and psychological consequences associated with exposures to harm and loss during disasters and complex emergencies, was used to identify the psychological risk factors and potentially traumatic events experienced by conflict-displaced persons in Colombia, stratified across the phases of displacement. Trauma and loss are experienced differentially throughout the pathway of displacement.

TI Proto-Insurgency, Repression-Driven Contagion, and Civil War Onset
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB The escalation of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) into interstate wars has been studied extensively with opportunity and willingness frameworks. In this article, we conceptualize and operationalize proto-insurgencies as a civil war equivalent to MIDs. Just as most MIDs do not escalate into interstate war, most proto-insurgencies never make the key tactical transitions needed to produce the onset of civil war. We separately examine proto-insurgency formation and proto-insurgency escalation to onset. We find that proto-insurgency formation is associated with political persecution, such as denial of access to justice, regime corruption, and mid-range levels of repression. Our theoretical focus is on how state repressive violence creates diffusion effects that push proto-insurgencies toward the tactical transitions that enable the escalation to civil war. Proto-insurgency escalation to civil war onset is driven by high levels of state repressive violence directed against proto-insurgency and its area of origin. This leads to the dispersal of proto-insurgents and the displacement of surrounding populations, inducing the spread of state repression to a larger number of administrative units. This creates the foundation for guerrilla warfare and establishes the conditions for rebels to offer sanctuary to displaced persons in return for active support, marking the onset of civil war.

   rights violations dataset
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Contemporary studies of civil conflict focus heavily on combatant treatment of civilians. Research on human rights (HR) abuses committed by states has benefitted from several widely available datasets on state violations. By comparison, researchers and policymakers have been limited by a dearth of data on violations committed by rebel groups. We introduce a new resource, the Rebel Human Rights Violations (RHRV) dataset, which measures the frequency with which rebel groups engage in eight HR abuses. The data include information for all rebel groups around the world between 1990 and 2018, and capture a wide range of violations, including arbitrary killing, detention, forced recruitment, property damage, torture, sexual violence, forced displacement and movement restriction. The RHRV provides new opportunities for researchers and policymakers to analyze an important aspect of civil conflict: the abuse of civilian populations by rebel groups.

TI Hear nothing, see nothing, say nothing: Can states reduce the risk of
   armed conflict by banning census data on ethnic groups?
SO INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW
AB Can states reduce the risk of violent political conflict by simply refusing to collect or publish data on their ethnic makeup and change? This study addresses a neglected aspect of the ethnic conflict literature and provides the first systematic empirical study of the significance of recording ethnic affiliation in censuses for the risk of armed conflict. A general empirical regularity noted in the ethnic heterogeneity and civil war literature is that ethnicity is associated with a somewhat higher risk of conflict in bipolar societies. However, few quantitative studies focus on how changes in the relative strength of groups may affect the risk of civil war. Some recent literature indicates that differential growth may destabilize heterogeneous democracies internally. In democratic societies, political power is distributed according to popular support in elections. A changing balance between groups may thus alter the distribution of power in regimes where ethnic, linguistic or religious divisions to a certain extent determine voting behavior, and this may potentially lead to political instability and ultimately civil conflict. We argue that the relationship between differential growth and instability and violence may be even more important in semidemocracies with electoral systems, but with weak and inconsistent political institutions. We start from the premise that, for differential growth to become a potential driver of instability and violent conflict, information about such change has to be recorded with a national census and actually published. In a cross-national time-series study we investigate whether countries publishing identity data from censuses are at a greater risk of experiencing low-intensity armed conflict. We find that the effect of publishing data on group size is indeed mediated through political institutions. In countries with stable institutions, publication of population identity data is associated with a lower risk of conflict, whereas unstable institutional arrangements are associated with an increase conflict risk when publishing such data.

TI Ghosts in the big city: surviving and adapting to internal displacement
   in Colombia, South America
SO INTERVENTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK
   AND COUNSELLING IN AREAS OF ARMED CONFLICT
AB The signing of the truce on 23 June 2016 and the finalisation of peace negotiations on 24 August 2016 marked the end of more than 50 years of continuous armed conflict in Colombia, South America and the transition to 'post conflict' status. According to annual reports from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre based in Geneva, Switzerland, Colombia has ranked first or second in numbers of internally displaced persons every year for the past 12 years, making forced migration a defining characteristic of the country. This is based on the personal reflections of a mother and daughter (ER and AdPGR) who were displaced from rural Colombia and resettled in the nation's urban capital of Bogota. They survived the rigors and hardships of displacement and became capable counsellors on a global mental health project, bringing evidence based interventions to a highly traumatised population of internally displaced women in Bogota. Their account speaks to the lived experiences of more than six million Colombian internally displaced 'victims of the armed conflict'. Particularly notable is the description of myriad trauma exposures prior to the moment of displacement. This field report demonstrates how personal accounts are a useful tool for educating clinicians working with these populations.

TI 'Corruption by Organised Crime'-A Matter of Definition?
SO CURRENT LEGAL PROBLEMS
AB The phenomenon of 'corruption by organised crime' is the subject of increased attention from policymakers in the UK. This focus is notable, given the limited political and academic consideration of the scope and meaning of this intersecting term. Both 'organised crime' and 'corruption' are difficult notions to pin down, definitionally and empirically, and such complexity is compounded by their conjunction. In this article, I problematize the dominant conceptualization of 'corruption by organised crime', and suggest that it is questionable in an abstract as well as operational sense. Given the ambiguity of the constituent concepts, as well as the implications for the development of criminal justice policy and law, I call for caution in its use. Instead I propose that we refer, and thus respond, to specific manifestations of corrupt practices for different criminal ends.

AB There is a strong relationship between organised crime and civil war. This article contributes to the crime-conflict nexus literature by providing a consideration of the role of organised crime in the Syrian conflict. It provides an overview of pre-and post- war organised crime in Syria. The article then builds the argument that war provides opportunities for organised crime through the state's diminished law enforcement ability; the economic hardship which civilians face during war; and the abundance of armed groups who all need to generate revenue. Secondly, the paper argues that organised crime also affects the intensity and duration of war by enabling militants to reproduce themselves materially and to build institutions amongst the communities where they are active. The relationships between armed groups and local populations emerge as a central theme in understanding the crime-conflict nexus.

Focussing on research into the relationships between climate change and armed conflict and peace, it argues that recent debates about the effect of climate change on conflagrations stem from deeper assumptions about the way the world is and can be known. The report then builds an alternative framing of peace as a phenomenon that is resilient to climate change by layering knowledge about the conditions under which peace prevails through environmental change with that on environmental peace-building and on the intersections between resilience and security.

Specifically, it addresses the potential that civil wars can elevate the risk that an infectious outbreak will emerge; the possibility that civil wars can reduce the capacity to identify and respond to outbreaks; and the risk that outbreaks in areas of civil conflict can generate political and security challenges that may threaten regional and international order. Both global health governance and international security structures seem inadequate to address the health and security challenges posed by infectious outbreaks in areas of civil conflict. New approaches that better integrate the technical and political challenges inherent in preventing pandemics in areas of civil war are urgently required.

This article suggests that the level of analysis may be at the heart of this discrepancy. In a time-series study of political violence in 27 Indian states for the 1956-2002 period, it is tested whether high population pressure on renewable natural resources, youth bulges, and differential growth rates between religious groups are associated with higher levels of armed conflict, political violent events, and Hindu-Muslim riots. The results are generally more supportive of the resource scarcity and conflict scenario than recent global studies. The article further suggests that youth bulges affect all three forms of violence and that differential growth rates are positively related to armed conflict.

TI Coordinating Transitional Justice
SO NEGOTIATION JOURNAL
AB Conflict resolution professionals sometimes differ from human rights professionals about the best approaches to transitional justice, particularly with regard to the scope, conditions, and timing of possible amnesties from prosecution for perpetrators of war crimes and human rights abuses. When human rights and conflict resolution professionals work at cross-purposes, they may work less effectively to end conflict, abuses, and crimes, and to implement peace accords. A consensus among conflict resolution and human rights scholars about which legal norms should govern post-conflict amnesty programs appears to be developing. Against this emerging legal framework, human rights and conflict resolution professionals should, I argue, develop processes for working together more effectively in the design and implementation of context-sensitive approaches to transitional justice. These process principles should address the entire conflict period, from escalation through resolution to post-conflict reconstruction. In this article, I describe a tentative, general framework for coordinating the development of transitional justice programs. This proposed framework is intended to stimulate and guide discussion of these issues among conflict resolution and human rights professionals and scholars.

AB Armed conflict within nations has had disastrous humanitarian consequences throughout much of the world. Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.

TI A Two-Stage Approach to Civil Conflict: Contested Incompatibilities and
   Armed Violence
SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB We present a two-stage approach to civil conflict analysis. Unlike conventional approaches that focus only on armed conflict and treat all other cases as at peace, we first distinguish cases with and without contested incompatibilities (Stage 1) and then whether or not contested incompatibilities escalate to armed conflict (Stage 2). This allows us to analyze factors that relate to conflict origination (onset of incompatibilities) and factors that predict conflict militarization (onset of armed violence). Using new data on incompatibilities and armed conflict, we replicate and extend three prior studies of violent civil conflict, reformulated as a two-stage process, considering different estimation procedures and potential selection problems. We find that the group-based horizontal political inequalities highlighted in research on violent civil conflict clearly relate to conflict origination but have no clear association with militarization, whereas other features emphasized as shaping the risk of civil war, such as refugee flows and soft state power, predict militarization but not incompatibilities. A two-stage approach to conflict analysis can help advance theories of civil conflict, assess alternative mechanisms through which explanatory variables are thought to influence conflict, and guide new data-collection efforts.

SO POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS
AB How do rebels choose among available tactics during civil war? How do they substitute one tactic for another? Although previous studies address these questions, they narrowly focus on the presence or absence of substitution. Differentiating the varieties of substitution, however, is critical. How rebels respond to their tactical environment including weather conditions depends on the type of substitution. I formally derive three types of substitution and test them by exploiting weather-induced exogenous variation in rebels' tactical costs for ground and marine violent activities. The analysis of daily panel data in 31 coastal conflict countries indicates that rebels substitute violent ground activities for maritime piracy but not vice versa. This asymmetry cannot be explained without differentiating substitution types.

SO COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Although scholars agree that ethnically divided societies are generally more prone to political violence, critics of consociationalism suggest that proportional representation and parliamentarism provide poor solutions for ethnically heterogeneous settings. I argue that extant findings about the impacts of powersharing institutions on conflict likelihood assume that institutions have a linear relationship with ethnic diversity, whereas in reality, the relationship is more complex. I demonstrate that proportional representation and parliamentarism are associated with an increased likelihood of civil conflict at mid-range levels of diversity but are associated with a decreased risk of conflict in more extremely divided settings, while federalism is independently associated with greater conflict risk at higher levels of ethnic heterogeneity. The results underscore that the peace-promoting effects of institutions may depend on how polarized societies are, encouraging scholars to think more seriously about the effectiveness of consociationalism for mitigating violence where there is greater ethnic diversity.

Although there is ample case study evidence that diamonds and similar resources have been used by rebel groups to finance fighting, there are few systematic empirical studies assessing the role of lootable resources in civil conflict. This is largely due to lack of reliable data on production and location. In this article we discuss priorities for the collection of data on conflict-relevant resources and introduce a new dataset, DIADATA, that provides a comprehensive list of diamond deposits accompanied by geographic coordinates throughout the world.

TI Ethnic fractionalization, natural resources and armed conflict
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Thus far, researchers working on ethnicity and resources as determinants of civil conflict have operated largely independently of each other. While there is plenty of evidence that natural resources may spur armed conflict, empirical evidence for the nexus between ethnic fractionalization and conflict remains inconclusive. Some authors conclude that ethnically fractionalized societies are actually spared from intrastate violence. Others find either a positive relationship or none at all between ethnic fragmentation and internal conflict. In this context, this paper serves two purposes: first, it shows that salience-based fractionalization indices are associated with a higher risk of ethnic conflict onset; second, it finds evidence that oil further increases the conflict potential within fractionalized countries. The combination of oil and a shared identity seems to help overcome the collective action problems associated with rebellion, by providing recruitment pools, strong motives and the necessary financial means for insurgency. Employing logit models for pooled time-series cross-sectional data, our quantitative analysis shows that various ethnic fractionalization indicators are robustly linked to a substantially increased risk of ethnic armed conflict onset in a subset of oil-abundant countries.

TI Myths on local use of natural resources and social equity of land use
   governance: Reindeer herding in Finland
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Previous literature on social equity has focused on procedure, distribution and recognition related to land use governance. We propose novel approach to examine social equity by following ideational turn with an aim to explore globally used and locally persistent myths that (mis)inform governance in practice and effect on the three dimensions of social equity for reindeer herding in northern Finland. We take synthetizing approach and elaborate and employ a comparative cognitive mapping method to classify the reviewed literature according to its linkage to the three dimensions of social equity, and type of relationship (utilizing, questioning, contextualizing) to the examined four myths. The myths of "tragedy of the commons", "non-human wilderness ideal", "noble savages", and "majority will constituting democracy" are persistently used in land use governance mainly because they provide justifications for furthering particular interest. Yet, these myths are also widely questioned due to the problems that their employment produces for reindeer herders. Furthermore, the background assumptions of the myths are often somewhat problematic. We discuss reinterpretation of these myths revolving around 1) a holistic approach, 2) considering non-indigenous local people as noble savages, 3) problems of melding herders as a stakeholder group similar to other groups, 4) steps from majority democracy towards self-governance, 5) whether social equity can be bought, and 6) biocultural diversity. These re-interpretations can inform land use policy and governance also beyond the case study. Therefore, critical view on the explanatory and constitutive powers of myths should be part of the portfolios to achieve social equity.

TI Building a sustainable peace: How peace processes shape and are shaped
   by the international legal framework for the governance of natural
   resources
SO REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
AB Natural resources are strongly connected to the onset, duration and recurrence of armed conflicts. However, even after an armed conflict has formally ended, natural resources can be an important trigger for a relapse into armed conflict. For these reasons, it is of the utmost importance, both from a security and a development perspective, to address natural resources as an integral part of the peace process. This article aims to assess how provisions in peace agreements addressing natural resource governance are embedded in the international legal framework. It inquires into the particularities and legal nature of peace agreements and examines the various functions of natural resource arrangements as part of peace agreements. Finally, as each category of natural resources comes with distinct legal questions and peacebuilding challenges, the article zooms in on water governance as a case study to explore the different ways in which natural resource arrangements in peace agreements and international law interact. The analysis is based on a study of 40 intra-State agreements, including the 2015 South Sudan agreement, the 2015 Mali agreement and the 2016 Colombian agreement.

TI The Syrian public health and humanitarian crisis: A "displacement' in
   global governance?
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Ongoing failure by the international community to resolve the Syrian conflict has led to destruction of critical infrastructure. This includes the collapse of the Syrian health system, leaving millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in urgent need of healthcare services. As the conflict intensifies, IDP populations are suffering from infectious and non-communicable disease risks, poor maternal and child health outcomes, trauma, and mental health issues, while healthcare workers continually exit the country. Healthcare workers who remain face significant challenges, including systematic attacks on healthcare facilities and conditions that severely inhibit healthcare delivery and assistance. Within this conflict-driven public health crisis, the most susceptible population is arguably the IDP. Though the fundamental right to health' is a recognised international legal principle, its application is inadequate due to limited recognition by the UN Security Council and stymied global governance by the broader international community. These factors have also negatively impacted other vulnerable groups other than IDPs, such as refugees and ethnic minorities, who may or may not be displaced. Hence, this article reviews the current Syrian conflict, assesses challenges with local and global governance for IDPs, and explores potential governance solutions needed to address this health and humanitarian crisis.

TI Civil War and Female Empowerment
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Recent research has directed attention to the transformative potential of war for female empowerment. As a disruptive shock, armed conflict can create a window of opportunity for advancing the societal role of women. We complement this research agenda by looking at how conflict severity and termination condition the outcomes for women in the aftermath of civil conflict. We expect that both level of violence and mode of resolution affect subsequent female empowerment, where severe conflicts ending by a negotiated settlement have the greatest transformative potential. Consistent with expectations, we find that post-conflict improvements in female empowerment occur primarily after high-intensity civil conflicts. However, subsequent tests reveal that this effect is driven largely by conflicts terminated by peace agreements. The greatest improvement in female empowerment is seen when peace agreements have gender-specific provisions. These results support calls for a sustained effort toward mainstreaming gender issues in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes.

AB Territorial accommodation in the management of ethnic conflict, while widely practised, has also been the subject of much academic debate which has failed to reach a conclusive verdict on its utility to contribute to sustainable conflict settlements. Reviewing three recent volumes on the role of institutions in conflict management processes, I focus on their central argument in relation to the question of whether territorial accommodation is a viable strategy for conflict management. While none of the volumes offers a conclusion to the debate over the merits of territorial approaches, they all provide sophisticated answers to some of the key questions continuously raised in this debate and all have significant potential to inform its policy dimension and to shape future research.

TI Can states buy peace? Social welfare spending and civil conflicts
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB This study examines whether the state's ability to provide social welfare services has any major effect on the probability of civil conflict onset. We argue that welfare spending contributes to sustaining peace because the provision of social services reduces grievances by offsetting the effects of poverty and inequality in society. Welfare spending serves as an indication of the commitment of the government to social services and reflects its priorities and dedication to citizens. By enacting welfare policies that improve the living standards of citizens, governments can co-opt the political opposition and decrease the incentives for organizing a rebellion. Utilizing time-series, cross-national data for the 1975-2005 period, the results indicate that as the level of the government investment in welfare policies (i.e. education, health, and social security) increases, the likelihood of civil conflict onset declines significantly, controlling for several other covariates of internal conflict. Additional data analysis shows that general public spending and military expenditures are unlikely to increase or decrease the probability of civil unrest. Overall, these findings suggest that certain types of public spending, such as welfare spending, might have a strong pacifying effect on civil conflict, and therefore the state's welfare efforts are vital for the maintenance of peace.

TI Legitimate peace in post-civil war states: towards attaining the
   unattainable
SO CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
AB Within the literature on conflict resolution and peace-building, there is a growing awareness about the need to move beyond 'minimalist' (absence of war) and 'maximalist' (absence of different types of structural violence) notions of peace. While the first concept is too narrow-it conceals much human suffering and does not take into account the root causes of armed conflict-the latter is too inclusive, open-ended and difficult to measure. There is, despite this growing consciousness, a lack of midterm definitions of peace that can help peacemakers assess whether a peace process is on the right track, say 10 or 15 years after a civil war has been terminated. In fact, when operationalising and empirically measuring how 'peaceful' post-civil war societies are, many scholars continue to employ indicators based on minimalist or maximalist visions of peace. In this article we introduce the concept of 'legitimate peace', which we argue can function as a midterm benchmark for peacemakers, and outline the benefits associated with its use.

TI Is There More Violence in the Middle?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Is there more violence in the middle? Over 100 studies have analyzed whether violent outcomes such as civil war, terrorism, and repression are more common in regimes that are neither full autocracies nor full democracies, yet findings are inconclusive. While this hypothesis is ultimately about functional form, existing work uses models in which a particular functional form is assumed. Existing work also uses arbitrary operationalizations of "the middle." This article aims to resolve the empirical uncertainty about this relationship by using a research design that overcomes the limitations of existing work. We use a random forest-like ensemble of multivariate regression and classification trees to predict multiple forms of conflict. Our results indicate the specific conditions under which there is or is not more violence in the middle. We find the most consistent support for the hypothesis with respect to minor civil conflict and no support with respect to repression.

It seeks to clarify what the 'problem of scale' means for democratizing GEG by classifying, and proposing partial answers to, multiple problems of scale: (1) The social barriers question: What political-economic barriers stand in the way? (2) The institutional formation question: What institutions need (re)forming? (3) The 'who' question: Who should participate and how should they be selected? (4) The procedural question: How and when should the global public participate? (5) The evaluative question: What are the criteria for process and outcome evaluation?

TI The impact of armed conflict and terrorism on foreign aid: A
   sector-level analysis
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB We examine whether armed conflict, international and domestic terrorism affect distribution of bilateral and multilateral foreign aid. We argue that the two types of aid may respond differently to security challenges because of donors' disparate objectives and aid-giving motives. The results show that armed conflict reduces the amounts of obtained aid of all types, conditional on a. country being an aid recipient. Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country. When we disaggregate aid flows by their purposes, we find that international and domestic terrorism are associated with increases in bilateral aid for promotion of governance, education, health and society.

TI Frictions and hybridity in Mozambique's post-war peacebuilding: From
   civil war to precarious peace
SO AFRICAN SECURITY REVIEW
AB It has been about three decades since Mozambique transitioned from a brutal civil war and one-party rule to peace and democracy. Although Mozambique has not relapsed into another large-scale civil war, sustainable peace and democracy in the country have become ever more elusive. In 2013, military clashes between Renamo and the Frelimo-led government resumed and prompted a new peace process, whilst poverty and inequalities are rampant, authoritarianism is on the rise, and an Islamic insurgency erupted in the northern region. Accordingly, while some scholars still praise Mozambique's post-war peacebuilding as successful, others have claimed that peacebuilding failed. This article evades the binary of successful or failed liberal peacebuilding in Mozambique. Instead, it applies the concepts of friction and hybridity to offer an alternative way of reading the 30 years of peace (building) in Mozambique. The article argues that frictions in values and interests between the international/liberal peacebuilders and local (non-liberal) elites have resulted in a negative and unstable hybrid peace, that is, a precarious peace in Mozambique.

TI "The War Will Come to Your Street": Explaining Geographic Variation in
   Terrorism by Rebel Groups
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB Geographic variation in rebels' use of terrorism is not well understood. This article explains the use of terrorism in civil conflict through examining geographic variation in terrorist attacks across first-level administrative regions. Two explanations are tested using data on 47 groups in 21 countries: that terrorism is intended to punish supporters of counterinsurgency efforts or to destabilize regions of the country that are both outside of rebels' military reach and have substantial grievances against the regime. Results show that terrorism is most prevalent in national capitals and regions that are more deprived. The findings suggest that rebel groups face multiple incentives for violence beyond zones of direct military confrontation with the government, using both highly visible attacks against the center of power and attacks intended to geographically expand the rebellion. The findings imply maximizing public service provision and minimizing economic inequality may reduce the breadth of rebels' potential expansion.

TI Solving the Moro problem: legalizing the Bangsamoro peace process
SO JOURNAL OF AGGRESSION CONFLICT AND PEACE RESEARCH
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the structural features that are proving central to the stability of the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and those features that were detrimental to its predecessors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a legalization framework derived from the model presented by Abbott et al. The simplicity of Abbott et al.'s theory allows for variation in the agreements' text to be easily measured and compared. The inherent advantages of this model offset the difficulties in characterizing peace agreements under traditional legal methodologies, and reiterate the importance of legalized agreements in a conflict resolution context.
   Findings - This paper finds that a more highly legalized approach to peace-making has resulted in greater agreement stability in the Philippines. More precise in detail and inclusive in scope, the legal nature of the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement has made it more responsive to the root causes of the conflict, and resilient to incidents that threatened to derail the peace process.
   Practical implications - This case study bears valuable lessons for conflict zones the world over, particularly the troubled negotiations on Syria, and the crisis in Ukraine. The study: lends tentative support to Gopalan's claim that agreements that exemplify hard legalization are much more sustainable in the long run; stresses the advantages of inclusivity in agreement sustainability and stability; reiterates the importance of addressing the key issues relevant to the conflict if the process is to be sustainable, and; notes the limitations of the legalization framework, but presents the Philippine example as a blueprint for addressing various aspects of the Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts.
   Originality/value - This is the first peer-reviewed analysis to explore the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement as a highly legalized conflict resolution instrument, and an adaptable template for peace agreement design generally.

TI Ethnic conflict, the state and the tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka
SO INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES
AB This paper examines how the Tsunami of 26 December 2005 re-defined some key dimensions of Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict and peace processes. It first shows how the contending perspectives on the post-tsunami recovery strategies had brought back to the centre of Sri Lanka's political debate issues of power sharing, regional autonomy, and national sovereignty. It demonstrates that the responses to Tsunami disaster and the advancement of the stalled peace process are closely interwoven and that they cannot be de-linked. It then argues that the post-tsunami recovery process has been intensely politicized in a context of the unresolved ethnic conflict and an incomplete, stalled peace process. The paper argues against the approach of 'reconstruction from above.' It also shows that the post-tsunami reconstruction is not about constructing buildings, roads and economic infrastructure, but that it involves rebuilding communities, community lives and livelihoods while enabling nearly a million of people who suddenly found themselves in absolute poverty and destitution. It argues that unless the affected communities are active participants in the exercise of re-building their lives, livelihoods and communities, the rebuilding process will be thoroughly undemocratic. It makes a case for re-building local autonomy in the South as well in the North and East in order link the peace process with the tsunami recovery process. The paper concludes with two arguments. Firstly, Sri Lanka's post-tsunami recovery process necessitates new ways for constructive handling of the ethnic conflict as well as the peace process in a 'conflict and peace sensitive' recovery framework. Secondly, a sustainable recovery process can productively be linked to a programme of state reform conceived in a framework of 'deep federalization.'

Addressing this gap in the literature, this study argues that the interplay between economic and political inequality and weak state capacity increases the risk of non-state conflict. An empirical analysis of 178 non-state conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1989 and 2011 provides support for the theorized conditional effect, but only for the role of economic inequality. The effect of political exclusion in the context of a weak state is not confirmed, suggesting that such conditions may be more prone to violence of another kind (i.e., mobilization against the state). Overall, these findings highlight the importance of a functioning state for maintaining peaceful inter-group relations, while they also lend support to earlier research that reports divergent effects of economic and political inequalities on civil conflict risk.

TI Don't blame the weather! Climate-related natural disasters and civil
   conflict
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB The issue of climate change and security has received much attention in recent years. Still, the results from research on this topic are mixed and the academic community appears to be far from a consensus on how climate change is likely to affect stability and conflict risk in affected countries. This study focuses on how climate-related natural disasters such as storms, floods, and droughts have affected the risk of civil war in the past. The frequency of such disasters has risen sharply over the last decades, and the increase is expected to continue due to both climate change and demographic changes. Using multivariate methods, this study employs a global sample covering 1950 to the present in order to test whether adding climate-related natural disasters to a well-specified model on civil conflict can increase its explanatory power. The results indicate that this is the case, but that the relation is opposite to common perceptions: Countries that are affected by climate-related natural disasters face a lower risk of civil war. One worrying facet of the claims that environmental factors cause conflict is that they may contribute to directing attention away from more important conflict-promoting factors, such as poor governance and poverty. There is a serious risk of misguided policy to prevent civil conflict if the assumption that disasters have a significant effect on war is allowed to overshadow more important causes.

TI Conflict-induced IDPs and the Spread of Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Recent scholarship has found evidence that refugee flows may inadvertently contribute to the spread of conflict across borders. Little is known, however, about the spatial diffusion of conflict within a state's borders and what role internal displacement plays in such a dynamic. This question is of relevance because of the particular marginalization of internally displaced persons, which make them at risk of predation and militarization by armed groups. Drawing on a novel global data set on internal displacement, we evaluate this question and find evidence for a similar mechanism leading to conflict spread operating at the domestic level.

TI The health impact of war
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INJURY CONTROL AND SAFETY PROMOTION
AB Armed conflict causes an enormous amount of death and disability worldwide. It destroys families, communities and cultures. It diverts scarce resources. It disrupts the societal infrastructure that supports health. It forces people to leave their homes and become internally displaced persons or refugees who have fled to other countries. It violates human rights. It promotes violence as a means to resolve conflicts and it degrades the environment. Armed conflict has an even more profound effect on low- and middle-income countries. Health professionals can play important roles in minimising the adverse consequences of war and in preventing war itself.

TI Globalization and the National Determinants of Violent and Nonviolent
   Ethnic Conflict
SO POLITICAL AND MILITARY SOCIOLOGY: POLITICAL ATTITUDES, PERCEPTIONS, AND
   CULTURE
SE Political and Military Sociology-An Annual Review
AB The intensification of globalization may be altering the ways in which ethnic groups engage in conflict with the state. Existing research has focused on the most severe form of ethnic conflict-ethnic civil war-at the expense of querying the determinants of other forms of violent and nonviolent ethnic conflict. In addition, research on civil war finds conflicting effects for different facets of globalization-political, cultural, and economic-on armed conflict. Using the Minorities at Risk dataset, we examine the effects of globalization and other national conditions on violent and nonviolent ethnic conflict in 106 countries between 1985 and 2002. These data allow us to introduce measures of both average and maximum intensity of both violent and nonviolent ethnic conflict-rebellion and protest. We draw from the literatures on ethnic fractionalization as well as modernization at the national level and world polity and world-systems theories at the global level. While all four theoretical approaches suggest predictors that pattern nonviolent ethnic conflict ( ethnic protest), modernization and world polity theory provide the most relevant predictors for the severity of violent ethnic conflict against the state ( ethnic rebellion). Our findings illustrate the utility of considering how both globalization and national development pattern both violent and nonviolent ethnic conflict. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and suggesting directions for future research.(1)

TI Conflict Environments and Civil War Onset
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB The spread of civil war poses serious risks and costs. We argue that conflict environments, which vary across time and space, systematically exacerbate the spread of civil war. As conflict in a state's neighborhood becomes more spatially proximate and as lingering effects of conflict accumulate over time, that state's risk of civil war onset increases. To theorize and test this argument, we construct the conflict environment (CE) score, a concept that taps into spatial and temporal dimensions of violence in a state's neighborhood. Using the CE score in established empirical models of civil war onset, we demonstrate that a dangerous conflict environment consistently elevates the risk of civil war, outperforming traditional measures of nearby violence, even when domestic factors are taken into account.

TI The Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Global Armed Conflict: Early
   Evidence
SO POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW
AB As Covid-19 spreads around the world, international actors, including the United Nations, have called for a stop to armed conflict to facilitate efforts to fight the pandemic. At the same time, coronavirus may also trigger and intensify armed conflict due to its negative economic consequences and by offering windows of opportunity to opposition movements to attack distracted and weakened incumbents. We use real-time data on the spread of Covid-19, governmental lockdown policies, and battle events to study the causal short-term effect of the pandemic on armed conflict. Our results suggest that both the spread of Covid-19 and lockdown policies exhibit a global Null effect with considerable regional heterogeneity. Most importantly, governmental lockdowns have increased armed conflict in the Middle East. In contrast, reported combat has decreased in Southeast Asia and the Caucasus as the pandemic has spread.

TI Environmental governance dimensions and perspectives for three
   transboundary African lakes
SO AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT
AB Factors considered necessary for effective environmental governance in large, transboundary lakes are presented. Institutional processes and governance structures are examined for three transboundary African lakes: Chad, Victoria and Tanganyika. Shortcomings in environmental governance for these lakes are: (i) inadequate linkages between science and policy and (ii) inadequate application of innovative, adaptive management approaches. Other shortcomings include: (i) untimely fulfillment of national and regional obligations by the riparian governments and (ii) lack of long-term sustainable financing mechanisms. Key recommendations for effective environmental governance are: linking scientific thinking and information to political decision making; investment in research and management; adoption and/or adaption of innovative management approaches; exchange of information and expertise; strategic partnerships; political commitment; long-term sustainable resource allocation; and development of mechanisms for addressing impacts of climate change and variability. Commitment to international conventions and sub-regional initiatives is also recommended for redressing environmental governance challenges for transboundary African lakes.

We utilize quantitative data from two representative sample surveys, conducted in 2016-2017, which probed respondents on their views on territorial readjustments, property provisions and power-sharing. Contrary to the current findings in the literature, internally displaced persons status is associated with higher levels of support for a negotiated peace settlement. The article examines the impact of anticipated threats and economic opportunities accompanying a settlement and suggests a set of institutionalized mechanisms to incorporate the views of internally displaced persons and other disadvantaged groups in future reunification talks.

TI EXAMINING THE USE OF AMNESTIES AND PARDONS AS A RESPONSE TO INTERNAL
   ARMED CONFLICT
SO ISRAEL LAW REVIEW
AB The use of amnesty for human rights violations has been heavily criticised on legal, ethical and political grounds. Yet amnesties have been the most popular transitional justice mechanisms over the past four decades, particularly in the context of internal armed conflict. States justify these amnesties by claiming they are important tools to secure peace. But how successful is amnesty in accomplishing these goals? This article seeks to answer this question by analysing the use and effectiveness of 236 amnesties used in internal armed conflicts worldwide since 1970. The article first creates a typology of the use of amnesty in the context of internal armed conflict. It then qualitatively examines the impact on peace of each type of amnesty. The article finds that most amnesties granted in the context of internal armed conflict have no demonstrable impact on peace and security. Yet amnesties granted as carrots to entice the surrender of armed actors occasionally succeed in bringing about the demobilisation of individual combatants or even entire armed groups. More importantly, amnesties extended as part of a peace process are effective in initiating negotiations, securing agreements, and building the foundation for long-lasting peace.

TI DEMOCRATIC STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW: INCORPORATION THE PRINCIPLES OF

SO REVISTA DE DIREITO DA CIDADE-CITY LAW
AB The change in economic, social and environmental behavior that was brought about by scientific and technological advances from industrial development ended up establishing a true environmental crisis. The referred crisis revealed to be a global environmental problem. In the face of such global environmental problems, new challenges to democracy arise, therefore, in this context, the Democratic State of Environmental Law comes to light as a way out. This work used the deductive method, and based on bibliographic research, it sought to demonstrate the importance of substantially incorporating the principles of Environmental Law into decision-making processes, whether public or private. In this way, the aim is to provide an ethical-environmental performance in the formulation of public policies, in the creation of standards, and also in the consideration of the environmental variable in the most varied public or private decision-making processes. In conclusion, it appears that environmental principles have not been satisfactorily incorporated into both public and private Brazilian decision-making processes, increasingly separating the Brazilian State from the Democratic State of Environmental Law model.

TI "An End to ETA: Fight against Terrorism or Conflict Resolution?"
SO REVISTA UNISCI
AB This article analyses the nature and dynamics of the new peace process started between the terrorist group ETA and the Spanish Government headed by President Rodriguez Zapatero. A new attempt to stop ETA's activities, characterised by a "lack of definition", tries to make compatible two essentially confronted approaches: a vision from the perspective of the fight against terrorism, and a vision of the process as a conflict resolution situation. To undertake a peace process with ETA on the basis of conflict resolution, trying at the same time to keep an antiterrorist policy, is conceptually incompatible. Furthermore, the Spanish Government's inability to accept all the implications and consequences of a peace process developed under conflict resolution rules and procedures respecting the present Spanish Rule of Law-makes this strategy non-viable.

TI Enemy at the Gates: Variation in Economic Growth from Civil Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB There has been much disagreement about the relationship between civil wars and state economic performance. While civil war is often associated with poor economic performance, some states have managed robust growth despite periods of domestic armed conflict. We find this disagreement results from not accounting for the spatial distribution of conflict within a country. A robust literature in economics stresses the role major cities play in economic growth. We hypothesize that the economic impact of civil conflict is contingent on the conflict's location relative to major urban centers within a state. We use subnational data on the location of conflict relative to urban areas to test the impact of domestic conflict on annual gross domestic product growth. In doing so, we bridge the economic development literature on the importance of cities with extant literature on the effect of armed conflict to provide a novel explanation for the paradox of high macroeconomic growth in conflict-ridden countries.

TI History and Ethnic Conflict: Does Precolonial Centralization Matter?
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB How does the trajectory of precolonial political institutions affect contemporary ethnic conflict? I argue that ethnic groups that were governed by centralized political institutions in the precolonial period are more likely to be associated with armed conflict in the present, but that colonial state-building strategies mediate this relationship. Ethnic groups that experienced precolonial centralization were likely to be underrecruited to the top ranks of colonial security forces prior to independence. This, in turn, increased the chances that those groups would be excluded from the first postindependence regime and hence become involved in armed conflict against the state in the long run. Conversely, colonial security forces tended to overrecruit ethnic groups that did not experience precolonial centralization. This made those groups more likely to become part of the first postindependence regime and less likely to enter into armed conflict against the state in the long run. I provide robust evidence for this pathway by using a self-collected dataset on ethnic groups in ex-British colonies. The findings underscore how contemporary ethnic conflict is embedded in longer-term historical state-building processes in hitherto unappreciated ways.

TI A congruence analysis of the inequality-conflict nexus: Evidence from 16
   cases
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB The relationship between inequality and civil conflict has attracted considerable interest in conflict research. Recent large-N studies have shown that inequalities significantly contribute to the outbreak of civil conflict and have proposed a number of causal pathways to account for this. These pathways, however, have rarely been assessed in systematic case-based research. This study implements a "middle-N" qualitative congruence analysis of 16 conflicts, focusing on the observable implications of the pathways through which inequalities are typically theorized to influence conflict. The study finds evidence to support some of the main pathways proposed in the quantitative literature. Furthermore, the analysis finds that different types of inequalities relate to different conflict categories. Specifically, vertical inequalities relate to non-ethnic governmental conflicts (via an "individual deprivation pathway"), regional inequalities to non-ethnic territorial conflicts (via a "separatist pathway"), and horizontal inequalities to ethnic conflicts (via a "group deprivation pathway").

TI Remaining Seized of the Matter: UN Resolutions and Peace Implementation
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB How can the United Nations support peace implementation efforts following civil conflict? Prior research shows that third parties can use a variety of conflict management approaches to prevent civil war recurrence and that peace agreement implementation improves peace duration and quality. However, little research connects these two aspects of postwar peace. We argue that United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions are an important tool that can be quickly used to support the peace. These resolutions can shame parties who do not comply with the agreement, deploy and coordinate resources needed for implementation, and empower local actors in postwar settings. Using implementation data for thirty-four Comprehensive Peace Agreements (CPAs) since 1989, as well as new data on the targets and language of UNSC resolutions, we show that language in a resolution that names and shames actors, connects stakeholders, or marshals resources is associated with better compliance with a CPA.

TI gender at the crossroad of conflict: tsunami and pence in post-2005 Aceh
SO FEMINIST REVIEW
AB After the devastating tsunami hit the northern Sumatran coastline in December 2004, the Indonesian province of Aceh found itself at a crossroad. This crossroad intersected the three-decade-long civil war, the move towards peace and the need for post-disaster recovery. This article analyses the gendered politics embedded in Aceh's navigation through this crossroad. First, it argues that both the conflict and the subsequent peace process were marginalised by the international programmes of post-tsunami recovery. Second, it demonstrates that within this marginalisation, women's investments in both war and peace were further neglected throughout the formal peace process. Third, it highlights how the peace process reflected a narrow, masculinist and public sphere agenda that silenced both women and the gendered issues affecting them. In short, this article seeks to unveil the gendered politics of war and peace in post-tsunami Aceh. It does so with the feminist ambition of demonstrating that sustainable and comprehensive peace in Aceh cannot be secured without recognising and accounting for the impact that the conflict has upon gendered identities.

TI Armed conflict and fisheries in the Lake Victoria basin
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Civil conflict is the most prevalent form of armed conflict in the world today, but this significant driver of food and income security has been largely missing from studies of fisheries. Fisheries conflict is an example of complex dynamics operating in social-ecological systems. We theorize and document the existence of such a feedback loop between conflict in Uganda and fisheries in Lake Victoria. Civil war in northern Uganda resulted in mass human population displacement, which corresponded in time with increases in fishing effort in Lake Victoria. Subsequent changes in catch of Nile perch, the dominant commercial fishery, sparked armed conflict in the lake itself, at Migingo Island, between Uganda and Kenya. From this case study, we draw seven main conclusions. First, these correlation-based relationships are illustrative but not conclusive and we call for further empirical investigation. Second, the couplings between conflict and fishing subsystems are spatially asymmetric: conflict effects are diffuse in their links to broad changes in the fishery, whereas fishery effects may produce more localized conflict events. Third, and most relevant to conflict scholars, the drivers of fishing effort and catch may originate in different subsystems, but their changes and effects must be analyzed in concert. Fourth, the complex and path-dependent impacts of conflicts on natural resources in general, and fisheries in particular, highlights the urgent need for targeted surveys and more mechanistic understanding. Fifth, the open access nature of fisheries in Lake Victoria may exacerbate instabilities not present in other systems. Sixth, the diffuse and context-specific effects of conflicts on fisheries means models of fisheries management (e.g., stock assessment) should not incorporate conflict as a driver at this time. Finally, countries and their stakeholders should focus on diversification in employment for short term coping mechanisms during conflict as a means of short-circuiting the conflict-fisheries feedback loop.

TI The politics of survival or business as usual? Exploring the effects of
   armed conflict on corruption
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Countries emerging from violent conflict must overcome several challenges to achieve long-lasting peace. The literature paints a bleak picture indicating that only few post-conflict countries improve in terms of good governance and the rule of law. Instead, they might experience even more corruption, because state structures are not fully developed while informal networks have flourished during the civil war. Yet, we know surprisingly little about what happens to corruption during conflict. In this study, we examine whether levels of corruption in post-conflict countries are systematically different from pre-war levels. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project, we find that corruption is relatively stable over time. However, longer and more intense conflicts are associated with higher levels of corruption.

TI INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE:
   SOUTHERN INFLUENCES
SO VEREDAS DO DIREITO
AB The purpose of this article when it discusses the southern approaches brought to global governance gets mixed with the addressing of the challenges facing the legal science in harmony with the others sciences to deal with the complex environmental issues of the 21st century. Thinking of a successful international environmental regulation is talking about an effort to understand the need for the instrumental law to comply with its role to solve complex issues that are typical of the construction of a sustainable society. The first part of the article consider that the international environmental law has been facing the emerging global environmental issues in an innovating way, incorporating a new form of global environmental governance based on which new players are brought to the discussion and implementation of measures to face environmental problems. After that, the article highlights the southern actions in the role of the scientific expertise and in the environmental paradiplomacy, and evaluates the influence and contributions in the decision making scenario and in the news perspectives of international law. The article concludes that the southern influences suggest a more pragmatic, finalistic international law that is concerned about the results, the achievement of the goals proposed.

TI Forecasting civil conflict along the shared socioeconomic pathways
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Climate change and armed civil conflict are both linked to socioeconomic development, although conditions that facilitate peace may not necessarily facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. While economic growth lowers the risk of conflict, it is generally associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and costs of climate mitigation policies. This study investigates the links between growth, climate change, and conflict by simulating future civil conflict using new scenario data for five alternative socioeconomic pathways with different mitigation and adaptation assumptions, known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We develop a statistical model of the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables on country-specific conflict incidence, 1960-2013. We then forecast the annual incidence of conflict, 2014-2100, along the five SSPs. We find that SSPs with high investments in broad societal development are associated with the largest reduction in conflict risk. This is most pronounced for the least developed countries-poverty alleviation and human capital investments in poor countries are much more effective instruments to attain global peace and stability than further improvements to wealthier economies. Moreover, the SSP that describes a sustainability pathway, which poses the lowest climate change challenges, is as conducive to global peace as the conventional development pathway.

TI The right to water for internally displaced persons in the Sahel region
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS
AB The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) has drastically increased over the last five years in the countries of the Sahel region. This situation is linked to the rise of countless armed groups, especially in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The present paper aims to assess the existence and contours of a right to water for IDPs in the Sahel region. In doing so, it examines international humanitarian law and other international law regimes to determine the legal foundations that protect and guarantee IDPs' right to water. The contribution provides the contextual background of armed conflict-induced displacement in the Sahel region, and demonstrates the existence of a right to water for IDPs in the Sahel countries. This right derives not only from international humanitarian law but also from other complementary international rules applicable even in conflict situations. The paper finally discusses and recommends legal and practical ways in which IDPs' right to water can be better realized in the current context of the Sahel region.

TI Principles of protection for internally displaced persons
SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
AB For forced migrants who have not left their country but are internally displaced persons, human rights law provides an important framework through which to analyse and address their plight. Two principal reasons underpin this assertion.
   First, owing to the compelling need: human rights violations cut across all phases of internal displacement, causing its occurrence, characterizing the conditions of physical insecurity and material deprivation in which the internally displaced often find themselves, and impeding equitable and lasting solutions.
   Second, as internally displaced persons remain within the territory of their state, refugee law does not apply and, instead, human rights law provides the fundamental basis for addressing their plight.
   In addition to human rights law, other standards of international law are also relevant, namely international humanitarian law when displacement occurs in situations of armed conflict and refugee law by analogy.
   Drawing on these three standards of international law, Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement have been developed which set out what protection should mean for internally displaced persons in all phases of displacement. This article traces the origins and provides an overview of the content of the Guiding Principles, the text of which is reproduced in full in the Appendix.

TI Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding: Social Work Education and
   Practice in Humanitarian Settings
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB The world is experiencing unprecedented levels of humanitarian crises due to the effects of climate shocks, intra-state and inter-state armed conflict. As of 2020, there were more than 70 million displaced persons globally with the global pandemic making the situation worse. It is expected that the current economic downturn will roll back the gains made in gender equity and poverty level improvements. With old conflicts remaining unresolved, and new ones springing up across the globe, a critical question arises of the role of social workers as agents of conflict resolution and peacemakers in addition to their traditional role of providing psychosocial support. This paper attempts to provide perspectives on the need for mental health social workers to actively and explicitly engage in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. In doing so, the authors will discuss the case of the Wajir Women Peace and Development, a women led organization that shaped the role of local professionals in engaging and sustaining peace in Northern Kenya and beyond. The choice of this organization is based on the personal and work experience of the authors who hails from Wajir and worked as a health and teaching professionals in late 1990s to mid-2000s.

AB In this paper, we provide an empirical investigation of the interaction between violent conflicts, democratization, and growth in the "third wave" of democratization. The effect of democratization is weakened when taking into account the incidence of civil conflict. The results show that the growth effect of democratization is heterogeneous and depends on the democratization scenario. Peaceful transitions to democracy have a significant positive effect on growth that is even larger than reported previously in the literature, whereas violent transitions have no, or even negative, growth effects.

TI Seeking procedural equity in global environmental governance: Indigenous
   participation and knowledge politics in forest and landscape restoration
   debates at the 2016 World Conservation Congress
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB The importance of meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples in global environmental governance is widely recognised. Yet, debates persist on the extent to which Indigenous perspectives and interests are included in environmental decision-making, including concerns about what constitutes procedural equity, issues of participation asymmetry, and hierarchies in forms of knowledge. While these questions have been extensively explored at the local governance level, the ways in which current structures of decision-making at the global level shape Indigenous participation and knowledge remains under-examined. The IUCN, World Conservation Congress (WCC) is a key site of global environmental decision-making. This paper examines how prevailing structures of power at the most recent (2016) WCC shape Indigenous participation and use of Indigenous knowledge, and thus procedural equity in this policy context. We examine participation and knowledge in relation to debates and discussions about forest and landscape restoration (FLR). We applied Collaborative Event Ethnography (CEE) methodology to collect data over 10-day intensive period. This included i) semi-structured interviews with 17 Congress participants, including Indigenous Peoples' representatives, international non-governmental organisation (INGO) and non-governmental organisation (NGO) specialists, and state agency representatives and ii) participant observation at 27 events relating to forest and landscape restoration. Our findings show that the structure of the WCC upheld prevailing power relations among actors and more powerful actors hold limited views about what constitute meaningful participation and pervasive view of Indigenous knowledge as a supplementary knowledge form in FLR debates. This study makes visible the ways by which prevailing structures of power within global environmental governance shapes access, consideration of different knowledge forms and thus procedural equity in the context of FLR debates.

TI Punitive House Burning in Chechnya: Is Collective Punishment Outside
   Armed Conflict Prohibited?
SO REVIEW OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN LAW
AB Collective punishment describes the punishment of a group for an act allegedly committed by one or more of its members and is prohibited in times of armed conflict. It is not explicitly prohibited in situations outside of armed conflict governed by human rights law. This contribution centers on a case study on collective punishment in Chechnya from the two Chechen Wars up until today. Recent years have witnessed the destruction of family homes of alleged insurgents in Chechnya. As it is unclear whether the armed conflict in Chechnya is still ongoing, it is equally unclear whether the law of armed conflict and the explicit prohibition of collective punishment apply to those punitive house burnings. This contribution explores the relation between the law of armed conflict and human rights law regarding collective punishment and concludes that, theoretically, human rights law could encompass such a prohibition.

TI From Tremors to Talks: Do Natural Disasters Produce Ripe Moments for
   Resolving Separatist Conflicts?
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB This article suggests that natural disasters can produce a ripe moment for conflict resolution because governments faced with the demand for effective disaster relief have incentives to offer concessions to separatist challengers. An analysis of the prevalence of new negotiations, ceasefires, and peace agreements during 12-month periods before and after natural disasters for separatist dyads 1990-2004 reveal some support for this proposition. Natural disasters increase the likelihood that parties will initiate talks or agree to ceasefires but have less effect on the signing of peace agreements. In line with the proposed mechanism, these results are particularly strong in democracies and following more severe disasters where the need to provide relief is most acute.

TI Police service contribution to the conformation of the Nation-State

   from the concepts of globalization and glocalization
SO REVISTA CRIMINALIDAD
AB The objective in this article consists of addressing the factors having determined the contribution and evolution of the Colombian National Police service during the armed conflict, in the light of the drug trafficking phenomenon and the terrorist events occurring in September 11, 2001 - explained as two circumstances that changed world history and broke paradigms in issues dealing with coexistence and security, by reason of its impact in the redefinition of the war against transnational crime. The methodology approached the correlation of historical milestones ranging from events taking place in the period between 1970 and 2006. The hypothesis of this research expresses that the connection between processes, police doctrine, and government policies established to deal with drug trafficking and terrorism crimes from the perspective of the globalization and glocalization concepts contributed to the conformation of the Nation-State in governance issues, during the challenge posed by the armed conflict having internationalized the Colombian police service and transformed it into a doctrinal and operational reference axis in the hemispherical and global environment. Research makes part of the academic discussions and analyses carried out by the Police Unit for the Construction of Peace ("Unidad Policial para la Edificacion de la Paz" (UNIPEP) for the preparation of police attention scenarios during Colombia's transition from the armed conflict into stable and lasting peace.

TI From bad to worse? How protest can foster armed conflict in autocracies
SO POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB Many protest movements have brought down dictatorships and paved the way for democracy. However, protests can also foster large-scale violence at the level of civil war. How can we explain the development from protest to armed conflict? In this paper, we use geographically fine-grained data to examine how collective mobilization leads to civil war violence at the local level. We argue that two mechanisms can explain this. First, in a protest escalation dynamic, confrontations between protesters and state security forces increase the willingness of protesters to ramp up the use of force. Second, in a protest capture mechanism, protests attract attention and resources from the state, thereby providing other local non-state actors with the opportunity to use violence. We test our theoretical expectations in a spatial analysis of protests and armed conflict in autocracies from 2003 to 2014. Our results show that protests increase the risk of local armed conflict when violently repressed. Further analysis reveals that the second mechanism, protest capture, accounts for the majority of escalations to armed conflict we see in our data.

SO GEOFORUM
AB This paper discusses the Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) crisis that affected the salmon industry in Chile between 2007 and 2009. For nearly 30 years, the salmon industry grew exponentially to become one of the top five exporting sectors, and the face of the new Chile: globalized and democratic. I argue that the crisis showed cracks in the neoliberal environmental governance mechanisms followed by Chile during that period, raising questions about the need for socially restructuring the political economy relationship with the environment by increasing state oversight over the use of the natural landscape in which the industry produced, while allowing firms to continue their exploitation pattern and global exports of commodities as their accumulation strategy. Furthermore, the political solutions that were introduced tested the ideological reliance of neoliberal environmental governance mechanisms on science and knowledge production for providing appropriate answers.

TI All Conflict is Local Modeling Sub-National Variation in Civil Conflict
   Risk
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Most quantitative assessments of civil conflict draw on annual country-level data to determine a baseline hazard of conflict onset. The first problem with such analyses is that they ignore factors associated with the precipitation of violence, such as elections and natural disasters and other trigger mechanisms. Given that baseline hazards are relatively static, most of the temporal variation in risk is associated with such precipitating factors. The second problem with most quantitative analyses of conflict is that they assume that civil conflicts are distributed uniformly throughout the country. This is rarely the case; most intrastate armed conflicts take place in the periphery of the country, well away from the capital and often along international borders. Analysts fail to disaggregate temporally as well as spatially. While other contributions to this issue focus on the temporal aspect of conflict, this article addresses the second issue: the spatial resolution of analysis. To adequately assess the baseline risk of armed conflict, this article develops a unified prediction model that combines a quantitative assessment of conflict risk at the country level with country-specific sub-national analyses at first-order administrative regions. Geo-referenced data on aspects of social, economic, and political exclusion, as well as endemic poverty and physical geography, are featured as the principal local indicators of latent conflict. Using Asia as a test case, this article demonstrates the unique contribution of applying a localized approach to conflict prediction that explicitly captures sub-national variation in civil conflict risk.

TI Mental health and the law: What else is needed for particularly
   vulnerable contexts facing armed conflict and development obstacles?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS
AB Mental disorders have high prevalence for disability and almost 80% of the global burden occurs in low- and middle-income countries. The impacts of mental health conditions can affect many sectors of society and threaten peace, human rights and development. However, international law jurisprudence has not sufficiently developed to guide mental health governance. This paper reviews the international legal protections for people who experience mental health conditions, including mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities. It focuses on State application of legal instruments in particularly vulnerable contexts, namely, least developed countries and situations of armed conflict. It argues that relying on existing treaties and soft-law instruments from the health and human rights angles is inadequate, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is not the right fit. New hard- and soft-law instruments are urgently needed to meet positive obligations and safeguard rights in these vulnerable contexts. Some suggestions for the contents of future instruments are made.

TI Power Sharing: Institutions, Behavior, and Peace
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Grievances that derive from the unequal treatment of ethnic groups are a key motivation for civil war. Ethnic power sharing should therefore reduce the risk of internal conflict. Yet conflict researchers disagree on whether formal power-sharing institutions effectively prevent large-scale violence. We can improve our understanding of the effect of power-sharing institutions by analyzing the mechanisms under which they operate. To this effect, we compare the direct effect of formal power-sharing institutions on peace with their indirect effect through power-sharing behavior. Combining data on inclusive and territorially dispersive institutions with information on power-sharing behavior, we empirically assess this relationship on a global scale. Our causal mediation analysis reveals that formal power-sharing institutions affect the probability of ethnic conflict onset mostly through power-sharing behavior that these institutions induce.

AB Armed conflict facilitates corruption and Angola presents a dramatic case study of this process. This article explores why the political context represents the key impediment to sustainable development. Solve the political problems and the gates are open for the Angolan people to reap the benefits of an abundant natural resource base with a low population density. The country has been trying to undergo three transitions simultaneously, that from war to peace, from single-party rule to multiparty democracy and from a command-based to a free-market economy. The article explores these processes and their effects on changing patterns of corruption.

TI Do giant oilfield discoveries fuel internal armed conflicts?
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB We use new data to examine the effects of giant oilfield discoveries around the world since 1946. On average, these discoveries increase per capita oil production and oil exports by up to 50%. But these giant oilfield discoveries also have a dark side: they increase the incidence of internal armed conflict by about 5-8 percentage points.This increased incidence of conflict due to giant oilfield discoveries is especially high for countries that had already experienced armed conflicts or coups in the decade prior to discovery.

TI Does civil war breed authoritarian values? An empirical study of
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Croatia
SO DEMOCRATIZATION
AB This article analyses how armed conflict affects individual support for liberal values. It is commonly assumed that the consolidation of democracy depends on individual values such as tolerance as well as aspirations of civil and political liberty. For post-conflict societies, consolidating democracy is also a means of reducing the risk of recurring violent conflict. However, democracy has proven to be especially hard to achieve and consolidate in ethnically divided societies. While previous research has centred mainly on institutions and political elites, I expand the focus to also include ordinary citizens. Using survey data from post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Croatia, I examine the effect of exposure to violence on a scale of authoritarian values. While the effects are small, the results show that war-related violence in some cases leads people to embrace authoritarian values.

TI Fighting over oil: Introducing a new dataset
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Recent research on armed civil conflict has suggested that oil-producing countries tend to experience conflict more often than their non-oil-producing counterparts. However, this research relies on weak and incomplete measures of petroleum resources. To facilitate more rigorous research on the possible links between hydrocarbons and conflict, this paper presents and describes a new global dataset, PETRODATA. The dataset includes 890 onshore and 383 offshore locations with geographic coordinates and information on the first oil or gas discovery and production year. PETRODATA allows researchers to control for both the spatial and temporal overlap of regions with hydrocarbon reserves and armed conflict. To illustrate the use of data, we conduct a duration analysis on the types of armed civil conflict. The results suggest that oil and gas located in conflict area lengthen governmental conflicts but have no effect on conflicts over territory.

TI Globalisation and Intrastate Conflict: An Empirical Analysis
SO CIVIL WARS
AB How does globalisation, especially foreign direct investment, influence the risk of intrastate conflict? While several prominent studies have found that globalisation reduces the probability of civil war, we use new data and methods to approach the question. In particular, we test for the possibility that foreign investment is endogenous to conflict risk and appropriately use inward foreign investment stock rather than net inflow to measure an economy's exposure to international capital markets. We find no evidence that foreign investment affects civil conflict, suggesting that governments' fundamental security interests trump the economic losses they can expect to suffer from failing to compromise with potential rebel groups.

SO INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW
AB Despite the fact that there are strong assumptions surrounding the effects of human rights violations on the risk of civil war, very few researchers have tested the relationship in an empirical and systematic manner. By drawing on both human rights-and civil war research, this article presents an integrated human rights peace and conflict theory. The effects of rights violations are tested by applying quantitative research methods. The main finding is that violations of economic and social rights and physical integrity rights increase the risk of civil war, while violations of other civil and political rights play only a minor role.

SO INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW
AB This article examines the legal relationship between terrorism and other transnational crimes. It considers how terrorist groups instrumentally commit other transnational crimes in order to support their terrorist activities, as well as when terrorist acts can qualify as other transnational crimes. The overlap and differentiation between terrorism and transnational organised crime is explored by reference to the un Transnational Organised Crime Convention 2000 (UNTOC) and its three protocols on human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and firearms trafficking. In particular, the article examines the distinction between politically motivated terrorism and the financial or material benefit that is central to the definition under the untoc. Beyond the untoc, the article then investigates the relationship between terrorism and a cluster of more disparate transnational crimes, including drug trafficking, illicit trafficking in cultural property, illicit exploitation of natural resources and environmental crimes, and kidnapping for ransom. The article identifies gaps in existing legal regimes.

TI Conceptual and Analytical Diversity of Environmental Governance in Latin
   America: A Systematic Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The analysis of environmental governance and the analytical frameworks used to study this concept in Latin America show that the term is diffuse and polysemic. The term governance refers to democratic societies that theoretically encourage the plural participation of actors in decision making to solve public or collective socioenvironmental problems. However, in Latin America, there is a broad social perception of a democratic deficit that affects the socioenvironmental sphere. The objective of this work is to determine the main trends in studies on environmental governance in Latin America, the most commonly used analytical frameworks and the predominant approaches to characterize the scientific and political uses of the concept. A systematic literature review is carried out on databases in English and Spanish, and 140 articles that consider environmental governance using various analytical frameworks are analyzed. The main finding is the predominance of a critical perspective on the effectiveness of environmental governance, as well as the associated institutional components and social organizations, because the democratic practices that should support it are questionable.

TI Generals, Dictators, and Kings Authoritarian Regimes and Civil Conflict,
   1973-2004
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Recent years have seen a surge of literature examining how political institutions influence the risk of civil conflict. A comparatively neglected aspect of this debate has been the heterogeneous impact of different forms of authoritarianism. In this article, I theoretically and empirically unpack the authoritarian regime category. I argue that authoritarian regimes differ both in their capacity to forcefully control opposition and in their ability to co-opt their rivals through offers of power positions and rents. Authoritarian regimes thus exhibit predictable differences in their ability to avoid organized violent challenges to their authority. I examine the association between four types of authoritarian regimes-military, monarchy, single-party, and multi-party electoral autocracies-and the onset of civil conflict from 1973 to 2004. I find that military regimes and multi-party electoral autocracies run a higher risk of armed conflict than single-party authoritarian regimes, which on the other hand seem to have an institutional set-up that makes them particularly resilient to armed challenges to their authority. These findings suggest that the emerging view, that political institutions are not a significant determinant of civil conflict, results from treating a heterogeneous set of authoritarian regimes as homogenous.

TI Bargaining and the Interdependent Stages of Civil War Resolution
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This article examines civil war resolution as a process comprised of multiple interdependent stages. It engages directly the idea that peace emerges only as a process comprised of battle, negotiation, agreement, and implementation of an agreement. I hypothesize that events at earlier stages of the peace process have implications for later stages, but not always in the same ways. Drawing on bargaining models of war, I consider how two factors that might prevent successful bargainingstalemates and the number of actorscan encourage cooperation early in a peace process but impede lasting cooperation at later stages. Using a nested dichotomies statistical approach to capture interdependence, I find support for the argument that stalemates and the number of actors have different effects depending on the stage of the peace process. The results substantiate the need in theoretical and policy work to consider peace as an interdependent, sequential process.

TI Does infectious disease cause global variation in the frequency of
   intrastate armed conflict and civil war?
SO BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB Geographic and cross-national variation in the frequency of intrastate armed conflict and civil war is a subject of great interest. Previous theory on this variation has focused on the influence on human behaviour of climate, resource competition, national wealth, and cultural characteristics. We present the parasite-stress model of intrastate conflict, which unites previous work on the correlates of intrastate conflict by linking frequency of the outbreak of such conflict, including civil war, to the intensity of infectious disease across countries of the world. High intensity of infectious disease leads to the emergence of xenophobic and ethnocentric cultural norms. These cultures suffer greater poverty and deprivation due to the morbidity and mortality caused by disease, and as a result of decreased investment in public health and welfare. Resource competition among xenophobic and ethnocentric groups within a nation leads to increased frequency of civil war. We present support for the parasite-stress model with regression analyses. We find support for a direct effect of infectious disease on intrastate armed conflict, and support for an indirect effect of infectious disease on the incidence of civil war via its negative effect on national wealth. We consider the entanglements of feedback of conflict into further reduced wealth and increased incidence of disease, and discuss implications for international warfare and global patterns of wealth and imperialism.

AB This article reviews the literature at the intersection of war, armed conflict, and food security, focusing on intergroup violent conflicts such as interstate conflict, civil war, insurgencies, state violence toward civilians, riots, and nonstate conflict. We briefly discuss recent trends in conflict and food security and note the channels through which conflict may impact food security in developing countries. Next, we review the quantitative literature, studying the pathways between conflict and food security and their effects on child health and household coping strategies, displacement, changes in factors of production, market and travel restrictions, and insurgent predation. The effect of food insecurity on conflict, related to limited access to land and shocks to commodity prices, is discussed. We briefly survey the effects of aid and assistance programs and then discuss the connection between climate change, conflict, and food security. The review concludes by identifying topics in this field that are ripe for future research.

Strengthening human rights and the rule of law by renewing the commitment made by countries in the region to democratic, governance and human rights frameworks, has the potential to bring sustainable peace back to Mali while preventing escalation in the neighbouring countries. Beyond the complete ratification and effective implementation of these various instruments, efforts must be pursued to improve democratic practices; strengthen ineffective national institutions; and support human rights monitoring mechanisms established at national and regional levels. Moreover, comprehensive transitional justice processes must be implemented in countries emerging from crisis, with a view to addressing past human rights abuses.

TI Repression or Reward: Assessing the Impact of Israeli Counterinsurgency
   Measures on Diverse Perpetrators of Palestinian Militancy
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB This study quantitatively assesses the impact of Israeli government actions on Palestinian militant attacks according to different categories: Islamists (Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad), nationalists (Fatah and Palestine Liberation Organization-affiliated groups), and unknown assailants from 1987-2004. Few large-n studies disaggregate among Palestinian factions. This study, however, identifies the scope of factional responses to counterinsurgency measures based on similar constituency pressures and divergent organizational objectives. For example, both indiscriminate repression targeting the wider population and discriminate concessions that reward suspected militants embolden armed actors to increase attacks across the Palestinian spectrum. But Islamists with maximalist goals significantly ramp up attacks to derail peace process-related events and disrupt concessions that benefit Palestinian society. Islamist factions fight to prevent the emergence of a two-state solution and avoid being sidelined by leading nationalist organizations, who have relatively limited objectives and are more likely to strategically reduce attacks to accommodate peace efforts. Additional findings point to other determinants of militant attacks, including religious and national holidays in multi-party armed conflicts. By analyzing diverse sets of armed actors among a broader national movement, this study contributes to research on counterinsurgency, rebel fragmentation, conflict management, and the strategic logics of terrorism.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
AB This article examines the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in environmental governance systems with a particular emphasis on non-state market-driven governance in the green building industry. Based on an extensive literature review, a conceptual framework of the function of NGOs in environmental governance is developed, focusing on five core aspects - role, power, accountability, legitimacy and acceptance - that define the position of NGOs in a governance system in relation to other stakeholders. The World Green Building Council's (WGBC's) global environmental governance movement has been identified as a dynamic market-driven governance system. Thus, the paper explores the role of regional green building councils (RGBCs) listed in the WGBC's directory within this newly deployed governance system. The results confirm the proposition that RGBCs grow in their governance and third-party role as they progress through the development stages proposed by the WGBC.

SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The globalization of economic relations of the XXI century led to the realization that human resources are the driving force in the development of the stability of the state. A great number of internally displaced persons that appeared was a challenge for Ukraine because the establishment and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main responsibility of the state. This is why the need to form a system of social cost audit on the internally displaced persons due to the armed conflict in the east of Ukraine is a priority in order to optimize the ways of establishing social consensus by taking concerted actions to develop human resources.
   The strategic focus of the social audit is to become a crucial factor for implementing the main principles of social partnership in regulating social and labour relations and carrying out the strategy of the financial encouragement of internally displaced persons due to the armed conflict in the east of Ukraine.
   The problems and needs of internally displaced persons were discussed by many researchers. The issue of improving the system of the social audit was described in the works of A. Liubenko, V. Rysin, V. Pikhotskyi, M. Bukovynska, O. Hnatiuk, O. Ponomarenko, S. Sachenko, F. Fukuiama, etc.
   As the analysis of the studies conducted by scientists implies, the urgent matter emerging in the current realities was not outlined in their works. Little attention was given to improving the efficient analysis system of social risks of either enterprise or state by implementing the social audit.
   The study aims at examining the consistent patterns of allocation of funds of pilot projects total cost between the number of registered internally displaced persons and their families in Ukraine using the social audit as the foundation for carrying out the strategy of the financial encouragement of internally displaced persons while they are socializing in new areas.
   The study analyzed the funds allocated for the implementation of pilot projects aiming at the protection of human rights and legitimate interests violated by the armed conflict in the east of Ukraine and/or temporary occupation of the part of Ukraine. The study of the consistent patterns of allocation of funds of pilot projects total cost between the number of registered internally displaced persons and their families in Ukraine was carried out. It was revealed that increasing the number of registered persons does not influence the allocation of funds between them. It emphasizes the importance of examining the factors of these phenomena, which can be provided by the social audit of allocation of funds on a national scale. The need to carry out the social audit using participatory principle is stressed.

TI The Challenges of Women Housed in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)
   Camps During an Armed Conflict in Ethiopia
SO AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
AB The outbreak of an ethnically and politically motivated armed warfare in Tigray in 2020, spread to the Amhara and Afar regions in Ethiopia, wreaking havoc on civilians. This armed conflict has had a significant impact on the lives of women who have been uprooted from their homes and are now living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. The purpose of this study was to examine the challenges faced by women living in two IDP camps in Dabat and Debark, Ethiopia. In-depth interviews were used to gather data from 13 participants. Challenges emerged that relate to three major themes: systemic (gender-based violence, family separation/disintegration, human trafficking, and genocide); psychological (trauma and stress; loss of home/personal belongings); and social (lack of social security and stability, reintegration and resettlement problems, unmet basic needs [physiological and physical health], and maladministration of supplies. The results of the study suggest that internally displaced women in Ethiopia are a group of targeted and victimized civilians suffering from a wide range of atrocities that are rooted in their gender identity, marginalized status, and extreme vulnerability. Lawmakers, politicians, advocacy groups, social work practitioners and women's activists must all advocate for stronger sanctions for those who perpetrate violence against women.

TI Dealing with Terrorism, Corruption and Organised Crime: The EU and Asia
SO PALGRAVE HANDBOOK OF EU-ASIA RELATIONS
AB After outlining why it is important to analyse and address terrorism, corruption and organised crime together, the chapter briefly considers definitional and measurement problems involved in researching these phenomena. In the next section, the situation over the past 15 years in a number of EU and Asian (ASEAN plus China, India, Japan and South Korea) states is considered. This is followed by an analysis of the methods used by states and international organisations (IOs) in Europe and Asia to combat all three phenomena. It is argued in the conclusions that it is often inappropriate to talk of either 'European' or 'Asian' situations or approaches, given significant differences between countries in both continents. But there are some contexts in which generalisations can be made. One relates to levels of democratisation and attitudes towards civil rights, while another contrasts attitudes towards sovereignty and principles. The implications of these differences on the battle against terrorism, corruption and organised crime are considered, and it is argued that, on balance, Asia has more to learn from Europe than vice versa. But in both continents, for reasons explained, states and IOs will continue to fight an uphill battle to control these phenomena.

TI Rethinking State Capacity: Conceptual Effects on the Incidence of
   Terrorism
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB The civil conflict literature often relies on state capacity having significant impacts on the risk of, and duration of, civil war and other civil conflicts. Many characteristics of civil conflict are often similar to terrorism, especially domestic terrorism, and are also considered when discussing the predictors of terror. However, what is not considered in either area of the literature is alternative characteristics of state capacity, namely, the degree of fragmentation in the policymaking branches, and its ability to enforce and carry out the laws that are implemented. This paper examines these effects, expanding the interpretation of state capacity to include these aforementioned concepts, and testing them simultaneously with the extant interpretation of capacity. Results show that when including these additional characteristics of capacity, previously accepted predictors are no longer relevant in predicting terrorism.

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Post-conflict North Waziristan is experiencing a fundamental shift in the political and economic environment at a very fast pace. This paper examines the complex political economy of post-conflict North Waziristan to assess factors promoting sustainable peace in the region. It identifies the multi-pronged official strategy that is significantly contributing to the transformation of the political and economic environment in the post-conflict setting. These steps include inter alia effective border management to counter illicit trafficking and cross-border terrorism, security sector reforms, improving the mechanism of governance, and diversifying 'formal' economic opportunities. The analysis suggests that post-conflict North Waziristan exhibits considerable improvements towards establishing and promoting conditions that are pivotal for sustainable peace.

TI Assessing concordance between trends in high-level drug trafficking and
   other serious and organised crimes in Australia, 2005-2006 to 2014-2015
SO DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY
AB Aims: Across the globe law enforcement agencies frequently link trafficking in illicit drugs to serious and organised crime such as terrorism and gun trafficking. However, there remain few systematic academic analyses of the extent and nature of links. This paper explored the extent of concordance between trends in high-level drug trafficking and seven other serious and organised crimes in Australia: and which crimes (and crime subtypes) most and least correlated with drug trafficking.
   Methods: Official crime data from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions was obtained on criminal prosecutions on drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, weapons trafficking, people trafficking, sex trafficking, terrorism and corruption and trends examined over a decade: 2005-2006 to 2014-2015.
   Results: Analysis revealed a positive correlation between drug trafficking and money laundering and subcategories of corruption, fraud and people trafficking. No positive correlation was found between drug trafficking and sex trafficking, weapon trafficking or terrorism. Differences were found by type of drug-trafficking offence.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that in Australia, high-level drug trafficking is most likely related to money laundering, fraud, corruption and people trafficking. It also suggests that drug trafficking and other serious and organised crime linkages may be more complex than often asserted.

TI Conceptualizing Civil War Complexity
SO SECURITY STUDIES
AB Civil wars that appear to observers to be the most complex-even using a colloquial understanding of the concept-are also those that seem to register the most intense fighting, the most prolonged spells of war, and the most resistance to durable conflict resolution. But what does it really mean for a civil war to be complex? We currently lack a concept of "civil war complexity " that can help us better understand the most important variations in civil wars across time and space. To address this gap we develop a conceptualization of "civil war complexity " consisting of three dimensions- "actor complexity, " "behavior complexity, " and "issue complexity "-and demonstrate how they manifest empirically. We also highlight this conceptualization's utility-and the danger of overlooking it-through the case of Darfur. This conceptualization paves the way for a new research agenda that explores how civil wars differ in terms of their complexity, the causes and consequences of civil war complexity, and how to refine conflict resolution techniques and strategies.

TI Analysis of the activities of law enforcement authorities in the field
   of combating crime and corruption offences
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyse the activities of law enforcement bodies in the field of combating crime and corruption offences. Design/methodology/approach In modern conditions in Ukraine, effective cooperation between law enforcement bodies and authorities at all levels, as well as with partner organisations and agencies at the national, regional and international levels to effectively combat crimes related to organised crime and corruption is of particular importance. Improving the investigative and detective capacity of the criminal justice system, combined with efforts to intensify cooperation, contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of joint struggle in this area, thus helping to deter, detect, punish and prevent crime and corruption offences. They must be directly part of a sustainable, long-term and comprehensive strategy to reduce the scope for corruption and open the political and economic system to greater competition. Findings The results of this study allow substantiating that the Ukrainian leadership understands the seriousness of corruption and organised crime: the state takes decisive legislative measures based on international experience. Originality/value The obvious mechanisms for reducing the level of corruption and organised crime in Ukraine can be: implementation of measures to ensure business freedom; the formation of anti-corruption business strategies; introduction of special methods of anti-corruption education; approbation in Ukraine of positive normative legal acts and practices of law enforcement of preventive nature of the European Union for joint activity of law enforcement bodies and civil society in the field of combating crime and corruption offences.

TI Ethnic Exclusion, Armed Conflict, and Leader Survival
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB Why do some leaders pursue ethnic exclusion even though it increases the risk of ethnic conflict? This article develops and tests a theory that explains how a leader's ethnic policy and the size of the minimum winning coalition interact to influence leader survival. An event history analysis of leadership duration between 1946 and 2012 shows that in non-democratic countries with small winning coalitions: (1) leaders who promote ethnic exclusion are more likely to survive longer in office than those who do not promote such policy; (2) leaders are more likely to be removed from office in a violent manner (e.g. coup d'etat) when they fail to employ ethnic exclusion; and (3) political benefits from ethnic exclusion are large enough to offset the risk of being involved in civil war. These findings suggest that ethnic exclusion can be a rational strategy for autocratic leaders even if it might increase the risk of civil war. Political reforms without considering this grim reality are likely to introduce another source of violence and instability in autocratic regimes.

TI The Role of Universities in Private Environmental Governance
   Experimentalism
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
AB In our federal, constitutional system of government, the states are often lauded as "laboratories of experimentation" for public policy, including for public environmental law. Yet private actors are playing an increasingly important role as parallel regulators through the adoption of private environmental governance. Private environmental governance can functionally advance one of federalism's core values: policy experimentalism. To the extent that private governance by business firms arouses skepticism for this experimental role because firms' motives to achieve profit in a competitive environment differ from the incentives motivating public regulators, private universities offer an alternative institutional locus for experimentalism. Using Yale University's recent adoption of a private carbon charge as a case study, this article argues that universities should play a greater role in private environmental governance experimentalism, and are worthy of more scholarly focus.

TI Civil Society and Peace Negotiations: Beyond the Inclusion-Exclusion
   Dichotomy
SO NEGOTIATION JOURNAL
AB Civil society is generally seen as an important actor in peace processes. But when it comes to reaching an agreement during peace negotiations, much of the current debate is centered on the question of including or excluding civil society. Although most researchers argue that civil society participation makes the process more sustainable and democratic, most practitioners emphasize that enhanced civil society participation makes it more difficult to reach a peace agreement. I argue that practitioners and theorists must both move beyond this dichotomy and, instead, focus on the variety of ways in which civil society actors can be included in a given negotiation process. To this end, I present in this article a comprehensive overview of nine models of inclusion, from most to least direct involvement of civil society, supported by illustrative case studies. Analysis of these models suggests that it will be possible to broaden the participation of civil society in peace negotiations without decreasing the negotiations' effectiveness.

It draws on macrohistory to contextualize war along its socio-political and psychological drivers and explores alternative options for conflict resolution. The macrohistory perspective offers an alternative view of armed conflict, as a vehicle of social change, due to its disruptive action on stagnating social conditions.

Hence, to enable global sustainable futures, the Causal Layered Analysis suggests plausible routes towards a partnership society.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study is to examine associations between deaths owing to terrorism, civil war, and one-sided violence from 1994-2000 and substance use disorder disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
   Methods: The relationship between terrorism, and related violence and substance use disorder morbidity and mortality among World Health Organization Member States in 2002, controlling for adult per capita alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, and economic variables at baseline in 1994.
   Results: Deaths as a result of terrorism and related violence were related to substance use disorder DALYs: a 1.0% increase in deaths as a result of terrorism, war and one-sided violence was associated with an increase of between 0.10% and 0.12% in alcohol and drug use disorder DALYs. Associations were greater among males and 15-44 year-old.
   Conclusion: Terrorism, war and one-sided violence may influence morbidity and mortality attributable to substance use disorders in the longer-term suggests that more attention to be given to rapid assessment and treatment of substance use disorders in conflict-affected populations with due consideration of gender andage differences that may impact treatment outcomes in these settings. Priorities should be established to rebuild substance abuse treatment infrastructures and treat the many physical and mental comorbid disorders.

TI Environmental Governance of China's Belt and Road Initiative
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
AB China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, is rapidly subsuming much of China's political and economic involvement abroad. As a far-reaching infrastructure development and investment strategy, officially involving more than 130 countries, the expansion of the BRI raises important questions about its environmental impacts and its implications for environmental governance. This article examines how China is actively and rapidly developing an institutional architecture for its envisioned "green BRI," considering the key actors, policies, and initiatives involved in the environmental governance of the BRI. We find that the current institutional architecture of the "green BRI" relies on voluntary corporate self-governance and a multitude of international and transnational sustainability initiatives. The effectiveness of the environmental governance of the BRI not only hinges on China's priorities and commitments, but also on the political willingness and capacity of BRI partner countries to maintain, implement, and enforce stringent environmental laws and regulations. We conclude by outlining several environmental governance challenges and an agenda for future research.

TI Civil war peace agreement implementation and state capacity
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Negotiated civil war terminations differ from their interstate war counterparts in that one side must disarm and cease to exist as a fighting entity. While termination through military victory provides a relatively more enduring peace, many civil wars end with peace agreements signed after negotiations. However, research has shown that the implementation of civil war peace agreements is difficult and prone to collapse. Often these failures are followed by recurrence of the conflict. In some cases, the agreements break down before key provisions are implemented. This article adds to this topic by focusing on the role of state capacity in peace agreement success. We argue that peace agreements and state capacity are necessary but not sufficient conditions for sustainable peace. The article employs a case study approach to explore the importance of state capacity in implementing civil war peace agreements. The role of third-party interventions is also considered. The cases (United Kingdom-Northern Ireland, Indonesia-Aceh, Burundi, Mali, and Somalia) include 14 peace agreements that vary by war type (secessionist or control over government), type of agreement (comprehensive or partial), levels of state capacity (high or low), and peace success (success, partial or failure), and each experienced third-party involvement in the peace process.

TI Theorising Global Environmental Governance: Key Findings and Future
   Questions
SO MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB Global environmental governance in the Anthropocene is fundamentally different from older conceptions of environmental policy-making and sustainable development. Environmental problem-solving is no longer concerned with isolated problems, but rather with reorganising the overall relation between humans and natural systems. Empirically, this is reflected in the ever greater attention to questions of institutional interactions (e.g. between the issue areas of economics and environment) and functional overlaps between parallel governance approaches. Normatively, environmental governance in the Anthropocene is concerned with questions of equity and fairness on a finite planet. This article scrutinises the theoretical interregnum in global environmental governance by first sketching the key empirical trends in global environmental governance; secondly, discussing theory-building with regards to four broad areas of inquiry: the questions of agency and authority; the structural dimension of global environmental governance; the related normative questions about legitimacy, accountability, equity and fairness in the Anthropocene; and finally the integration of governance research into formal approaches and the related incorporation of non-social science concepts into environmental governance research. In our conclusions, we propose some initial ideas on how to move forward in the study of global (environmental) governance.

AB In this research note, I argue that scholars of the international diffusion of civil conflict would benefit from directly measuring rebel mobilization prior to the onset of civil war. To better understand the way in which international processes facilitate dissidents overcoming the collective action problem inherent in rebellion, I focus on militant organizations and model the timing of their emergence. I use several data sets on militant groups and violent nonstate actors and rely on Buhaug and Gleditsch's(2008) causal framework to examine how international conditions predict militant group emergence. While Buhaug and Gleditsch conclude that civil war diffusion is primarily a function of internal conflict in neighboring states, once militant group emergence is substituted in the dependent variable, I observe that global conditions affect rebel collective action. A final selection model links militant groups with civil conflict onset and demonstrates the variable performance of diffusion effects. The results indicate that many rebels mobilize in response to more global events and then escalate their behavior in response to local conditions.

TI Actor Fragmentation and Civil War Bargaining: How Internal Divisions
   Generate Civil Conflict
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Wars within states have become much more common than wars between them. A dominant approach to understanding civil war assumes that opposition movements are unitary, when empirically, most of them are not. I develop a theory for how internal divisions within opposition movements affect their ability to bargain with the state and avoid conflict. I argue that more divided movements generate greater commitment and information problems, thus making civil war more likely. I test this expectation using new annual data on the internal structure of opposition movements seeking self-determination. I find that more divided movements are much more likely to experience civil war onset and incidence. This analysis suggests that the assumption that these movements are unitary has severely limited our understanding of when these disputes degenerate into civil wars.

TI Organised crime and public sector corruption: A crime scripts analysis
   of tactical displacement risks
SO TRENDS AND ISSUES IN CRIME AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB In 2006, the Australian Government introduced the Anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) which increased regulatory controls over businesses potentially able to facilitate organised criminal activities such as money laundering. The implementation of tougher legislation and associated law enforcement interventions may result in criminal organisations adjusting their tactics in order to continue their activities without detection. In this paper, the risk and potential impact of tactical displacement by organised criminals is discussed with regard to the potential for increased attempts by organised crime groups to corrupt public servants. There is a paucity of research exploring the nature and extent of public sector corruption committed by organised crime groups. This discussion is informed by literature on 'crime scripts' originally developed by Cornish (1994) and the 5I's crime prevention framework developed by Ekblom (2011). Making use of public-source information about the commission of such crimes, as exemplified in two recent corruption cases, some intervention strategies are proposed that may be effective in reducing the risks of corruption of public sector officials by organised crime groups in Australia.

TI The Role of Political Exclusion and State Capacity in Civil Conflict in
   South Asia
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB Extant literature on intrastate conflict independently explores terrorism and civil war. However, both terrorism and civil war are probably parts of a continuum of intrastate conflict with the former at one end and the latter at the other end in terms of intensity. I argue that two factors play important roles in rebels' decision-making calculus, namely, the size of their support base and state strength. Terrorism, as a strategy of the weak, is optimal when the rebel groups have little support among their audience and the state is strong. On the other hand, guerrilla warfare is an ideal strategy when such groups have a greater support base and the state is weak. The theoretical argument is tested on a dataset of Myanmar and six countries of South Asia and for 1970-2007.

SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB Do private firms act beyond "business as usual" and proactively build peace? Firms are largely absent from the conflict management literature, despite studies suggesting their importance. What conditions encourage firms to actively prevent or resolve violent conflict? Are such actions interdependent with ongoing international conflict prevention and management efforts? I argue international efforts encourage corporate conflict management-related activities since conflict management interdependencies can decrease the costs of conflict management, while increasing the benefits and success of their efforts. In addition, firms respond to gaps in governance and instability, especially when they are norm entrepreneurs or their reputation is threatened. I test these arguments on original cross-national data of conflict management-related efforts by large, domestic firms in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa from 1999-2013. The findings bring large-N empirical analysis to a topic dominated by case studies and emphasize the need for conflict management scholars to account for the role of the private sector in our studies.

This paper analyzes the research focus and transformation situation of China's environment governance and law by searching related papers with the subject words "environmental law" in Chinese Journal Full-text Database. The co-word analysis results show environmental law research showed five main knowledge focuses, such as international environmental law, sustainable development, environmental right, participation, and environment conservation. And according to the co-word analysis, environmental law research may be divided into four stages: foundation, prosperity, from theory to practice transformation, and challenge stage of environmental law response to new environment problems. By analysis of the research focus, we can know China's researchers in the environmental governance policy or law should strengthen the scientific, pertinence and prospective characteristics of environmental law research, make interdisciplinary and comprehensive study combined with China long-term science and technology development.

TI Battle Diffusion Matters: Examining the Impact of Microdynamics of
   Fighting on Conflict Termination
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB How does diffusion of civil war battles influence conflict termination? Recent advances in civil war literature have found that battle dynamics shape conflict termination by affecting the intra-conflict bargaining between disputants. This article extends the theoretical perspective and argues that how battles diffuse matters in determining conflict termination. While battlefield dynamics should in principle reveal previously unavailable private information, the relevance of information-revealing effect depends on the diffusion patterns of battles. The persistent, and possibly battle-exacerbated, commitment problem can also alter the prospects of conflict termination. We test the argument by distinguishing two distinct diffusion patterns of battles: distant and proximate. The empirical results reveal that distant diffusion, but not proximate diffusion, of battles makes civil conflicts less likely to terminate. The analysis also demonstrates that incorporating diffusion dynamics significantly improves our ability to predict conflict termination.

But who are these politicians and what is the evidence regarding to whom they listen? In the United States (US), critical research documents how the public's will is being subverted-and people and planetary health are being harmed-via changes to the 'rules of the game' that affect democratic governance. Health professionals, organizations, and institutions should encourage civic engagement-for themselves, their staff, members, and study participants-regarding: voter registration; being counted in the 2020 Census; countering partisan gerrymandering; and helping to build strong coalitions addressing profound links between climate change, health equity, and democratic governance.

SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB This study provides evidence from Pakistan on how the delegated task of achieving strategic objectives of the donor can lead to incompatibility of aid objectives which then generates perpetual and multidimensional domestic conflict in the recipient society. We use count data method to estimate the relationship between aid and conflict. At the aggregate level, social sector spending, regime change and youth bulge are positively and significantly related with conflict. However, aid per capita gives ambiguous results. It is significant with conflict count in the terrorism data-set and insignificant for data on armed conflict. Inclusion of youth bulge and unemployment rate confirms the marginalization hypothesis of conflict. Inflation rate and the tax variables are insignificant. This confirms that aid erodes fiscal capacity. At project-level data, conflict is strongly related with aid commitment and purpose. Discrepancy in aid allocation and commitment may accentuate conflict.

AB The question of how conflicts affect the nature of the peace forms a puzzle for students of civil conflict. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence exist supporting the conclusion that increased violence leads to longer or shorter peace durations. Applying a model of rivalry that includes public support of conflict, this paper hypothesizes that the greater the concentration in fighting, the longer the subsequent peace between internal rivals lasts. This hypothesis receives support from tests on the duration of peace between enduring Internal Rivalries. The implications from this finding provide new advice for policy makers seeking to invest scarce resources into civil conflict management.

AB Urban green spaces serve a variety of residents with various perceptions, preferences and demands. Their effective governance and precision provision increasingly require public input. Due to the unique political regime, public decision-making in China has long been controlled by governments with the public neglected. With increasing civic consciousness in recent years in urban China, this research investigated attitudes and willingness toward participation in planning, management and design of urban green spaces in Guangzhou. Face-to-face questionnaire surveys were conducted at the 24 green sites across the city with 595 respondents successfully interviewed. The results demonstrated the positive attitudes and strong willingness toward participation despite socioeconomic variations, fitting into a global trend of increasing civic consciousness and strengthening the theoretical base of public participation. Practically, the positive findings lay a sound social foundation for the participatory decision-making in urban China, and help to drive local governments more open and inclusive and develop effective governance strategies and mechanisms to promote public participation in decision-making of urban green spaces.

TI Between environmental and ecological democracy: theory and practice at
   the democracy-environment nexus INTRODUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
AB Concepts of ecological and environmental democracy seek to reconcile two normative ideals: ensuring environmental sustainability while safeguarding democracy. These ideals are frequently conceived as being in conflict, as democracy is perceived as too slow and cumbersome to deliver the urgent large-scale collective action needed to tackle environmental problems. Theories addressing the democracy-environment nexus can be situated on a spectrum from theories of ecological democracy that are more critical of existing liberal democratic institutions to theories of environmental democracy that call for reforming rather than radically transforming or dismantling those institutions. This article reviews theoretical and empirical scholarship on the democracy-environment nexus. We find continued theoretical and empirical diversity in the field, as well as vibrant debates on democratising global environmental politics, local material practices, and non-human representation. We argue for stronger dialogue between environmental political theory and empirical, policy-oriented research on democracy and sustainability, as well as further exploration of complementarities between ecological and environmental democracy. We identify four main areas of challenge and opportunity for theory and practice: public participation and populism; technocracy and expertise; governance across scales; and ecological rights and limits.

(2) Environmental governance can strengthen the promotion of green low-carbon policies to AGTFP. (3) There are regional differences in causality among AGTFP, environmental governance, and green low-carbon policies.

The pandemic has resulted in substantial changes to government work cultures, financial management, and the implementation of good governance. The paper has shown how these governments react to the crisis caused by Covid-19. We analyse strategy, policy, and financial management when facing Covid-19 and give a result that will contribute to the development of crisis governance field. In this article, we argue that the most successful action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in high income, upper-middle income, and lower-middle income countries is guided by the implementation of good governance principles. Data used in this research was obtained from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The results indicate that countries that have been able to manage the COVID-19 pandemic have good governance indicators, such as voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.

Starting with unofficial efforts by the Indonesian side from mid-2003, which eventually led the parties to the negotiation table and to the signing of the MoU in August 2005, the peace process put an end to the 30-year conflict over the independence of Aceh. The peaceful resolution of the Aceh conflict will be examined using readiness theory, which posits the factors that lead parties to negotiate, and the theory's hypotheses will be applied to understand the factors that contribute to success in negotiating a peace agreement. The study also examines the Aceh peace process from the perspective of central coalition theory, which relates to the readiness of the actors in the internal political debate to negotiate and reach an agreement.

TI The Syrian conflict: a case study of the challenges and acute need for
   medical humanitarian operations for women and children internally
   displaced persons
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Background: After 7 years of increasing conflict and violence, the Syrian civil war now constitutes the largest displacement crisis in the world, with more than 6 million people who have been internally displaced. Among this already-vulnerable population group, women and children face significant challenges associated with lack of adequate access to maternal and child health (MCH) services, threatening their lives along with their immediate and long-term health outcomes.
   Discussion: While several health and humanitarian aid organizations are working to improve the health and welfare of internally displaced Syrian women and children, there is an immediate need for local medical humanitarian interventions. Responding to this need, we describe the case study of the Brotherhood Medical Center (the "Center"), a local clinic that was initially established by private donors and later partnered with the Syrian Expatriate Medical Association to provide free MCH services to internally displaced Syrian women and children in the small Syrian border town of Atimah.
   Conclusions: The Center provides a unique contribution to the Syrian health and humanitarian crisis by focusing on providing MCH services to a targeted vulnerable population locally and through an established clinic. Hence, the Center complements efforts by larger international, regional, and local organizations that also are attempting to alleviate the suffering of Syrians victimized by this ongoing civil war. However, the long-term success of organizations like the Center relies on many factors including strategic partnership building, adjusting to logistical difficulties, and seeking sustainable sources of funding. Importantly, the lessons learned by the Center should serve as important principles in the design of future medical humanitarian interventions working directly in conflict zones, and should emphasize the need for better international cooperation and coordination to support local initiatives that serve victims where and when they need it the most.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Among current studies, there is still question as to whether conflict increases, decreases, or has no effect on HIV prevalence. This lack of clarity can be attributed to the scarcity of quantitative analysis in this field. Thus, studies about conflict and HIV have failed to specify the ways conflict affects HIV prevalence, if indeed it does. In this paper, I argue that armed conflict increases HIV prevalence by reducing total per capita health spending. Using HIV prevalence data from 1990 to 2009, I find supporting evidence in the case of civil conflicts for these arguments. In addition, I find that as the severity of civil conflict increases, so do HIV rates. These findings have significant policy implications for individual governments, as well as for the international community.

TI Mapping War, Peace and Terrorism in the Global Information Environment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LEGAL STUDIES
AB This article outlines in general terms how the environment of 21st century transnational organised crime, terrorism and unconventional conflict is being shaped by information-related capabilities (IRCS) that foster global networked connectivity and asymmetric responses to conventional military supremacy. This article explores how the conceptual apparatus regarding the distinction between wartime and peacetime, as well as war zones and peace zones, which has been developed within the framework of international criminal law and humanitarian law, can contribute to military-strategic operational and capability concepts. Integration of these conceptual frameworks within strategic analysis can serve to promote the effective use of force within a full spectrum operational environment in which information, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance thresholds are being lowered as deeper understandings of the social dynamic that sustains ongoing fighting within a global information environment become increasingly feasible through innovations in IRCS. In this context, this article suggests that law enforcement frameworks and approaches have a high threshold of applicability, i.e. to increasingly serious and organised situations of violence, if the strategic failures associated with conventional military operations are to be avoided. Rather than offering an analysis of cyber warfare/cyber attacks or information operations per se, this article is more generally concerned with understanding how military support and command and control operations are being conducted in the global information environment in order to achieve physical effects that can be characterised as non-international armed conflict.

TI The Role of Universities in Private Environmental Governance
   Experimentalism (vol 33, pg 57, 2020)
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
AB In our federal, constitutional system of government, the states are often lauded as "laboratories of experimentation" for public policy, including for public environmental law. Yet private actors are playing an increasingly important role as parallel regulators through the adoption of private environmental governance. Private environmental governance can functionally advance one of federalism's core values: policy experimentalism. To the extent that private governance by business firms arouses skepticism for this experimental role because firms' motives to achieve profit in a competitive environment differ from the incentives motivating public regulators, private universities offer an alternative institutional locus for experimentalism. Using Yale University's recent adoption of a private carbon charge as a case study, this article argues that universities should play a greater role in private environmental governance experimentalism, and are worthy of more scholarly focus.

SO BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH
AB This article explores the nature and dynamics of criminal violence in central Mexico through the lived experience of internally displaced persons (IDPs) over the past ten years. First, the issue of internal displacement and the context of violence and drug-trafficking in Mexico is addressed, then reflections are made on the methodological, security and ethical challenges of doing fieldwork in contexts of violence. Three case studies are drawn upon to illustrate the complexities of violence, organised crime and state (in)action leading to forced displacement. Findings are analysed and framed as grey zones, uncertain and at times indecipherable and terrifying.

TI Health system governance in settings with conflict-affected populations:
   a systematic review
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB Health system governance has been recognized as critical to strengthening healthcare responses in settings with conflict-affected populations. The aim of this review was to examine existing evidence on health system governance in settings with conflict-affected populations globally. The specific objectives were (1) to describe the characteristics of the eligible studies; (2) to describe the principles of health system governance; (3) to examine evidence on barriers and facilitators for stronger health system governance; and (4) to analyse the quality of available evidence. A systematic review methodology was used following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis criteria. We searched six academic databases and used grey literature sources. We included papers reporting empirical findings on health system governance among populations affected by armed conflict, including refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced populations, conflict-affected non-displaced populations and post-conflict populations. Data were analysed according to the study objectives and informed primarily by a governance framework from the literature. Quality appraisal was conducted using an adapted version of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of the 6511 papers identified through database searches, 34 studies met eligibility criteria. Few studies provided a theoretical framework or definition for governance. The most frequently identifiable governance principles related to participation and coordination, followed by equity and inclusiveness and intelligence and information. The least frequently identifiable governance principles related to rule of law, ethics and responsiveness. Across studies, the most common facilitators of governance were collaboration between stakeholders, bottom-up and community-based governance structures, inclusive policies and longer-term vision. The most common barriers related to poor coordination, mistrust, lack of a harmonized health response, lack of clarity on stakeholder responsibilities, financial support and donor influence. This review highlights the need for more theoretically informed empirical research on health system governance in settings with conflict-affected populations that draws on existing frameworks for governance.

AB In a world of rapid population growth, urbanization, and climate change, sustainability and environmental integrity are increasingly central concerns. The frequent recurrence of conflict within these arenas, coupled to the difficulty in determining their impact on social-ecological systems, challenges governance at all levels of society. Negotiation-based conflict management provides a promising response to these challenges. This guest editor's article examines: (a) the emergence and conduct of environmental and public policy (EPP) conflict management as a distinctive practice over the past 40 years; (b) the interplay between theories of environmental decision-making and practices of EPP conflict management; (c) trends in research into EPP conflict management systems, the dynamics of interventions into these systems to resolve conflict, and the efficacy and impact of EPP conflict management practices; and (d) the contributions of the articles contained in this special issue to this literature and future directions in the field.

TI Why Bad Governance Leads to Repeat Civil War
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Most contemporary civil wars are now recurrences of earlier civil wars. In contrast to classic theories of grievance and opportunity, this article advances a theory of civil war recurrence that highlights the critical role political and legal institutions play in constraining elites in post-civil war states. Such constraints serve as a check on executive power, help incumbent elites credibly commit to political reform, and create a situation where rebels need not maintain militias as a supplementary mechanism to hold political elites in line. All of this reduces the odds of repeat civil war. Using a statistical analysis of post-conflict years, this article demonstrates that strong political institutions are not only significantly and negatively related to repeat civil war but are the primary determinants of whether countries get caught in the conflict trap.

TI More Combatant Groups, More Terror?: Empirical Tests of an Outbidding
   Logic
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB We examine and test the logic that outbidding among insurgent groups results in more suicide terrorism specifically and more terrorism of any type, which has become a popular argument in recent years. A global analysis of terrorism from 1970-2004 provides scant support for the notion that outbidding increases suicide terrorism. An extension of the argument to all types of terrorist attacks provides even less support. The logic of outbidding has received considerable attention in academic and policy circles in recent years.(1) Similar to the argument that democratic occupation increases suicide terror,(2) our lack of empirical support suggests that considerable cross-national work is still needed to understand suicide terror adequately. We suggest some reasons why this may be the case, drawing particular attention to the problem of overgeneralizing from a limited set of cases.

TI Codification and Prospect of China's Codification of Environmental Law
   from the Perspective of Global Environmental Governance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Global environmental governance is the fundamental way to solve the human environmental crisis. With China as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the development of China's environmental law is a key component of global environmental governance. In order to better realize the construction of an ecological civilization, the compilation of China's Environmental Code has been officially put on the work schedule of the legislature. The compilation of the code is a sincere action, showing that China has taken the initiative to assume its own responsibility for environmental governance. In the past 50 years, China's environmental legislation has achieved a great leap forward: from nothing to something, from something to something more comprehensive. Aside from this progress, defects such as the internal imbalance of the environmental law system, the backwardness of some environmental legislation ideas, and the inability of environmental legislation and its academic research to fully match China's national conditions also exist. With the helping hands of conditions and times, it is most appropriate for China to start the compilation of the Environmental Code now. Environmental Codes such as the Swedish Environmental Code, the French Environmental Code and the German Environmental Code (Draft of the Committee of Experts) provide many empirical references for the compilation of China's Environmental Code. China will make important an contribution to world environmental governance again-an Environmental Code in line with international standards while maintaining native characteristics.

TI Seeds of peace? Land reform and civil war recurrence following
   negotiated settlements
SO COOPERATION AND CONFLICT
AB Land reform has been depicted by some as an effective element of counterinsurgency strategy in nations experiencing peasant-based civil conflict. While some studies have argued that land reform reduces civilian support for insurgency, other research has demonstrated that these reforms are often undermined by brutal state repression. The study of land reform has also been driven largely by qualitative case study research, which has limited what we know about the cross-national efficacy of these reforms. This study contributes to the current literature by looking at the efficacy of land reform as part of the post-civil war peace process. Specifically, we examine whether land reform provisions included in comprehensive peace agreements reduce the risk of renewed civil war. Measuring the risk of civil war recurrence in all comprehensive peace agreements from 1989-2012, we find that the inclusion of land reform provisions in the post-war peace process substantially reduces the risk of renewed fighting.

TI Measurement and spatial-temporal analysis of coupling coordination
   development between green finance and environmental governance in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB To direct financial resources for achieving the goal of sustainable development, Chinese government has devoted increasing efforts to developing green finance. However, few studies explored the relationship between green finance and environmental governance. Thus, this paper first theoretically discusses the interactive connection between green finance and environmental governance. And then we construct two comprehensive indicator systems and use entropy method to calculate green finance index (GFI) and environmental governance index (EGI) for 30 provinces of China from 2004 to 2020. The theoretical analysis unveils the complementary and mutual reinforcing relationship of the interaction between green finance and environmental governance through green industry. Using the data of GFI and EGI, the coupling coordination degree of green finance and environmental governance (CCDGE) is measured by coupling coordination model. The trend analysis discovers that GFI is increasing over time while EGI starts decreasing from 2013. Although GFI has grown more rapidly than EGI, but the development of green finance still lags behind environmental governance because of its short history. Just because of the uncoordinated development between green finance and environmental governance, CCDGE has been hovering in the moderate coupling coordination stage for a long time and still has a great distance to the high coupling coordination level. These findings imply that the relationship between green finance and environmental governance is still in a state of disorderly development that restricts each other. Furthermore, the findings of spatial-temporal analysis show there are obvious regional differences in GFI and EGI and the interactive effect between green finance and environmental governance. Specifically, GFI and EGI in eastern China are the highest, while CCDGE presents with a ladder decline status of "eastern region > central region > northeast region > west region." Our findings provide vital references for policymakers to promote the coupling coordination development between green finance and environmental governance.

TI Good for the money: International finance, state capacity, and internal
   armed conflict
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Previous research indicates that a lack of state capacity is a key determinant of internal armed conflict. Scholars identify several internal dimensions of state capacity, but have yet to explore how international finance influences state resources. This is surprising because sovereign lending has increased dramatically in recent decades and plays an increasing role in the functioning of developed and developing governments. In this article, we explore this relationship between a state's integration into global credit markets and its subsequent capacity to promote domestic stability. We argue that international capital increases a state's ability to respond to internal opposition because states with favorable credit terms can expand their resource base beyond domestic constraints to deter, accommodate, or repress opposition while maintaining a level provision of resources to their political base. We examine the influence that both capital access and credit terms have on the risk of civil conflict in 141 countries from 1981 to 2007. Our empirical results indicate that states with affordable credit access are indeed less likely to experience civil conflict.

AB In light of criticism by political commentators and law enforcement experts about counterterrorism overshadowing the investigation of other forms of serious crime-in particular, organised crime-this study explored whether the use of intelligence-led policing would be better directed towards all serious crime, rather than prioritising terrorism. An expert jury comprising twelve subject/practitioner specialists were surveyed. The study used a purposive sampling technique to gauge the jury's views on the current policy priorities, with the options being counterterrorism to serious crime, and the value of intelligence in policing regarding these offences. The findings, though not conclusive, provide compelling support for the hypotheses. That is, the results of a decision-tree analysis showed that intelligence-led policing could provide approximately 2.1 times the utility over the current approach.

Controlling for source country characteristics, we find that civil war increases high skilled emigration by 3-6 percentage points. Further, the nature of conflict matters: While brain drain from countries with ethnic conflict is about 5-8 percent greater than from non-conflict countries, the effect of non-ethnic conflict is less, and is not statistically significant. Duration also matters: Each additional year of ethnic conflict worsens the brain drain by 0.4-0.7 percent, whereas the duration effect from non-ethnic conflict is small and insignificant.

   Colombia?s areas of limited statehood for energy diversification towards
   governance in energy democracy
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB We conducted a qualitative study (2019-22) to contextualise Colombia's energy policy for sustainable development and renewable energy diversification, focusing on the new governance toolbox of market incentives, weak institutions, security risks in areas of limited statehood, and the role of indigenous people. We also examined how geopolitical events, such as COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are affecting fossil fuel and decarbonisation strategies. Our findings suggest that weak institutions are a major obstacle to Colombia's energy transition. The Western definition of energy democracy takes for granted good governance in line with SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; however, in Colombia, the context of social unrest, violence, corruption, and inequality hinders its implementation. Colombia's energy policy considers green investment a market opportunity rather than a way of institution building or phasing down fossil fuels, and there is no meaningful communication with civil society, especially indigenous people, to develop small-scale green investment initiatives. This study enhances energy policy by emphasising the role of governance and strong institutions in energy democracy. We argue that if governments and corporations were committed to climate change mitigation, they would invest in institution building over renewable energy.

In this context, today's societies are challenged to move towards a sustainable transition, by building a more just and egalitarian coexistence model in the region. Various academic circles, centers of strategic analysis and development, as well as political activists, have argued in favor of transforming governance models, the social contract, as well as the interactions within and between society, economy and government, based on new values and imaginaries which would enable to move from a market society to more sustainable alternatives, towards greater social equity and well-being. Reflecting on new governance models is therefore a global challenge which, in this regional context, focuses on sustainable transition processes. This article explores conceptual framings on environmental governance and possible virtuous interactions between the various contributions and approaches, in order to robustly incorporate political dynamics into change processes.

TI The Evolution of Green Growth Policy: An Unwelcome Intrusion on Global
   Environmental Governance?
SO JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB The notion of green growth emerged in 2009. Since then, policy makers and practitioners have largely adopted the term. Although rather intermittently, there have been academic observations on green growth, with the term often being cited as a paradigm and a policy guide for generating new sources of growth. The most important reasons for the surge in green growth today as a new trend and an international agenda item are the rather unsatisfactory results and pitfalls of sustainable development, which has failed at promoting a tangible international environmental principle or a concrete policy framework. Green growth has been proposed as an alternative simultaneously to foster the dynamics of global environmental governance and to reinvigorate the world economy. This study examines to what extent green growth plays a complementary role in existing global environmental governance. Available evidence provides reasonable grounds for arguing that a positive outcome may well be expected from the evolution of green growth architecture and followed by practical policies. It became a global agenda out of a few influential national governments' control. However, decision makers in the leading countries, both developed and developing must be willing to continue implementing what has been discussed and agreed thus far, beyond changes in political leadership and administrations.

TI The Desire to Return during Civil War: Evidence for Internally Displaced
   Populations in Colombia
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB Armed conflict in Colombia has forcibly displaced more than 3.6 million people. In a post-conflict scenario, the socioeconomic stabilization of displaced households is crucial, as families must decide whether to stay in the reception place, relocate to a new municipality or return to their site of origin. In this paper we identify the determinants of the desire to return of internally displaced households in Colombia. We find that i) land tenure in the place of origin provides an incentive to return; ii) vulnerable households, in particular female-headed households and those from ethnic minorities seek to establish themselves at the reception site and exhibit a lower desire to return; iii) those who displaced as a consequence of a direct attack are less willing to return; iv) economic opportunities in the place of origin encourage return while economic opportunities at the reception site decrease the willingness to return; and v) social networks, as exemplified by membership in peasant organizations and collective land ownership, increase the desire to return. To be successful, the design of stabilization programs for the displaced population must consider these particularities of the households that are willing to return and those who prefer to stay in the reception site.

TI SOME INSIGHTS ON THE LINK BETWEEN TERRORISM, ORGANISED CRIME AND 'NEW
   WARS'
SO UNDERSTANDING TERRORISM: A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE
SE Contributions to Conflict Management Peace Economics and Development
AB Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to investigate on the relationship between terrorism, criminal organisations, and the so-called 'new wars'.
   Methodology/approach - Review of the existing literature on the 'new wars' and on the terrorism-crime nexus; estimate of the financial revenues gained by terrorist groups engaged in illicit activities.
   Findings - Terrorist and criminal groups can develop several forms of collaboration. Whether terrorists convert to criminal activities or not depends on a variety of factors, both internal and external. In some cases these links are occasional and opportunistic, associated with the possibility of exploiting the availability of specialised competences in a stateless environment, in other cases the warring parties are directly involved and create stable relationships as a way to finance their war activities.
   Research limitations/implications - Lack of reliable data limits a comprehensive analysis. Nevertheless, the study has important consequences for designing and adopting more effective policies regarding terrorism, organised crime, as well as conflict resolution.
   Originality/value of the chapter - The study presents an overview of different strands of the literature on terrorism; a discussion is articulated on the interplay between 'new wars' and the terror-crime connection. Potentially fruitful avenues of investigation are suggested for future research.

TI Amos and 'Ghana in the Eyes of God': a Public Theological Response to
   Bribery and Corruption
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY
AB The purpose of this article is to draw upon the condemnation of bribery, corruption and miscarriage of justice to be found in the book of Amos for the sake of a public theology. The occasion for such is a bribery scandal that hit the Ghanaian judiciary. An investigative journalist presented evidence to substantiate the hitherto unsubstantiated perception that some judges in Ghana take bribes to skew judgement. The scandal is deepened through many of the judges being Christian. They attracted widespread criticism from religious leaders, both Christian and others, as well as from the wider society. The public sphere of a fair and independent judiciary was thus compromised. The argument draws upon an assessment of Amos 5:7; 10, 12 and 6:12. These texts are examined in the light of this judicial bribery and corruption scandal and thus provide an example of how the Bible can play a part in a public theology and nurture of social justice.

TI The Ties That Bind: Ethnicity, Pro-government Militia, and the Dynamics
   of Violence in Civil War
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Existing research reveals many of the ways pro-government militia (PGM) shape civil violence but overlooks how the ethno-political ties between the state and a PGM might influence these effects. We argue that co-ethnic militia (i.e., groups composed of the ruling elite's ethnic kin) are relatively loyal irregular forces that multiply state military capacity. The greater loyalty of co-ethnic groups mitigates principal-agent problems but further polarizes ethnic communities, and as a result, co-ethnic PGMs are likely to be associated with longer and more intense civil conflict. We test this argument on a global sample of cases from 1989 to 2007 using new data capturing the ethnic ties of all PGMs. The results support our claims that co-ethnic militia are associated with more intense and longer civil conflict.

TI Civilian Victimization and Ethnic Civil War
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB While many studies provide insights into the causes of wartime civilian victimization, we know little about how the targeting of particular segments of the civilian population affects the onset and escalation of armed conflict. Previous research on conflict onset has been largely limited to structural variables, both theoretically and empirically. Moving beyond these static approaches, this article assesses how the state-led targeting of specific ethnic groups affects the likelihood of ethnic conflict onset and the evolution of conflicts once they break out. Relying on a new data set with global coverage that captures the ethnic identity of civilian victims of targeted violence, we find evidence that the state-led civilian victimization of particular ethnic groups increases the likelihood that the latter become involved in ethnic civil war. We also find tentative, yet more nuanced, evidence that ethnic targeting by state forces affects the escalation of ongoing conflicts.

TI Conflict Recurrence and Postconflict Justice: Addressing Motivations and
   Opportunities for Sustainable Peace
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB Why do some postconflict states return to violence, while others remain at peace? Analysts increasingly credit postconflict justice institutions such as truth commissions, amnesties, reparations, and trials with contributing to the prevention of conflict recurrence following civil wars. But scholars remain divided about the overall effectiveness of these varied institutions. In this article, we directly engage this debate. We seek to overcome theoretical and data limitations that make it difficult to address the relationship between justice institutions and the likelihood that conflict will recur. We find that only postconflict justice processes that lessen conflict-induced grievances, and thus address individual motivations to rebel, are successful at keeping the peace. In a series of statistical tests using new data on postconflict justice from 1946 to 2006, we find strong support for the role of motivation-addressing processes in reducing conflict recurrence.

TI When Do States Take the Bait? State Capacity and the Provocation Logic
   of Terrorism
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB A prominent theory holds that groups may use terrorism in order to provoke governments into undertaking repression that alienates the population. However, virtually no studies have addressed the central puzzle of this provocation logic: why states would actually fall into this trap, if doing so can backfire. This study seeks to address this puzzle by suggesting conditions under which states would respond to terrorism with repression. I argue that states with limited bureaucratic capacity are more prone to using repression after terrorist incidents, as their ability to selectively crack down is inhibited by their more limited capability for controlling, monitoring, and collecting revenue from their populations and for collecting intelligence on suspected terrorists. Using a cross-national analysis with data from 1981 to 2011, I find it is low-capacity states which are most likely to respond to terrorism with repression, while constraints on executive authority have no clear effect.

TI Attacks on Civilians in Civil War: Targeting the Achilles Heel of
   Democratic Governments
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB Previous research has indicated that democracy decreases the risk of armed conflict, while increasing the likelihood of terrorist attacks, but we know little about the effect of democracy on violence against civilians in ongoing civil conflicts. This study seeks to fill this empirical gap in the research on democracy and political violence, by examining all rebel groups involved in an armed conflict 1989-2004. Using different measures of democracy, the results demonstrate that rebels target more civilians when facing a democratic (or semi-democratic) government. Democracies are perceived as particularly vulnerable to attacks on the population, since civilians can hold the government accountable for failures to provide security, and this provides incentives for rebels to target civilians. At the same time, the openness of democratic societies provides opportunities for carrying out violent attacks. Thus, the strength of democracy-its accountability and openness-can become an Achilles heel during an internal armed conflict.

TI When Strength Becomes Weakness: Precolonial State Development, Monopoly
   on Violence, and Civil War
SO COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Does the legacy of precolonial statehood affect contemporary levels of civil conflict outside Europe? I argue that places with higher levels of precolonial state development were more likely to end up as weak modern-day states because precolonial state structures and authority structures established by European colonizers came to exist in parallel. This created opportunities and motivation for civil conflict still present in many countries today. I illustrate the argument in the cases of India, Burma, and Ethiopia and test it statistically in a global sample covering 109 countries outside Europe. The results strongly support the theory. Countries with higher levels of state development 3500 BCE-1500 CE have weaker state monopolies on violence and markedly higher levels of intrastate armed conflict in modern times (1946-2018). The findings remain robust across numerous alternative specifications, including using the timing of the Neolithic Revolution as an instrument.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS & INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB What explains longstanding UK non-compliance with international anti-bribery norms? Drawing on evidence from a comparative study of state compliance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anti-bribery Convention and building on the literature on framing' in Sociology and International Relations, this article identifies and illustrates the impact of strategic policy framing on UK anti-bribery policy in the years following the United Kingdom's commitment to criminalize transnational business bribes, in 1997. The research examines the way in which anti-bribery proponents and opponents framed the practice of transnational bribery differently across four distinct policy contexts in the United Kingdom: international development and poverty reduction, domestic anti-corruption, strategic trade, andfollowing 11 September 2001international anti-terrorism. The analysis shows that: (a) policy advocates' choice of frame crucially affected the timing and scope of UK anti-bribery legislation and the extent of UK (non)compliance with international anti-corruption law; and (b) the expedient frame was not necessarily the most conducive to full compliance.

TI Transnational organised crime and terrorism: Nexus needing a human
   security framework
SO GLOBAL CRIME
AB This paper proposes that application of the human security framework enables us to see a negative impact of globalisation on the transnational organised crime and terrorism nexus. The main argument is that state-building and globalisation create conditions allowing for international organised crime and terrorism to cooperate in international and failed-state spheres. Namely, while state-building and traditional security measures suppress terrorist means to operate in strong states, globalisation offers international organised crime lucrative opportunities to escape strong states and instead operate in the non-state sphere (international and failed state). This process makes state-centric traditional methods of combating terrorism and crime, such as the war on terror, largely ignorant of how international organised crime and terrorism operate in non-state sphere. To address security challenges posed by transnational terrorism and crime in the non-state sphere, a human security framework offers an enhanced understanding of the problem.

TI Implementing the Peace: The Aggregate Implementation of Comprehensive
   Peace Agreements and Peace Duration after Intrastate Armed Conflict
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) is often seen as a historic milestone in a peace process, and its implementation takes a highly legitimized set of reforms and puts it front and center in national politics. This article examines the aggregate implementation of CPAs signed since 1989 and future conflict behavior between the negotiating parties and between the government and non-signatory groups. It argues that implementation is both a peace-building process and an outcome that normalizes political relations between hostile groups, solves commitment problems and addresses the root causes of civil conflict. Statistical tests utilizing new data on the implementation of CPAs support the argument. The extent to which an agreement is implemented is shown to have significant long-term effects on how long peace lasts - an effect that applies not only to the signatories of the agreement, but also to the government and non-signatory groups.

TI Influencing factors of green energy transition: The role of economic
   policy uncertainty, technology innovation, and ecological governance in
   China
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB For environmental sustainability and resource security, the global energy system requires a revolutionary transition from traditional energy to green energy resources. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of economic policy uncertainty, technological innovation, ecological governance, and economic growth on the green energy transition in China. We employed a bootstrap auto-regressive distributive lag (BARDL) model to evaluate the long-run association between the study variables from Q1-2000 to Q4-2020. The preliminary finding confirms the long-run cointegration relationship among model variables. The results show that economic policy uncertainty and economic growth negatively derive green energy transition in the long-run. In contrast, technology innovation and environmental governance positively influence the green energy transition. These findings propose strengthening of the environmental governance mechanism and technology innovation to accelerate the green energy transition in China.

TI Language, Education and the Peace Process in Myanmar
SO CONTEMPORARY SOUTHEAST ASIA
AB This article analyses the relationship between the politics of education and language, and armed conflict and ongoing peace process in Myanmar. It 'discusses the state education system, which since the military coup of 1962 has promoted the idea of the country based on the language and culture of the Bamar (Burman) majority community, and the school systems developed by ethnic armed groups which oppose the military government. Ethnic opposition education regimes have developed mother tongue-based school systems. In some cases, the Mon for example, these broadly follow the government curriculum, while being locally owned and delivered in ethnic languages; in others, such as the Karen, the local education system diverges significantly from the Myanmar government curriculum, making it difficult for students to transition between the two systems. This article explores the consequences of these developments, and how reforms in Myanmar since 2011 including the peace process, which remains incomplete and contested have opened the space for educational reform, and the possible "convergence" of state and non-state education regimes. Ethnic nationality communities remain determined to conserve and reproduce their own languages and cultures, adopting positions in relation to language and education which reflect broader state-society relations in Myanmar, and in particular ethnic politicians' demands for a federal political settlement to decades of armed conflict. The article concludes that sustainable resolution to Myanmar's protracted state-society conflict is unlikely to be achieved until elites can negotiate agreement on ethnic language and teaching policies.

Research on the topic has developed along separate research streams, which broadened the knowledge base considerably, but hardly interact across disciplinary, methodological, epistemological and ontological silos. Our forum addresses this gap by bringing into conversation six research streams on the environment, peace and conflict: environmental change and human security, climate change and armed conflict, environmental peacebuilding, political ecology, securitisation of the environment, and decolonizing environmental security. For each research stream, we outline core findings, potentials for mutual enrichment with other streams, and prospects for future research.

TI Environmental governance and its implications for conservation practice
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Governments are no longer the most important source of decision making in the environmental field. Instead, new actors are playing critical decision-making roles, and new mechanisms and forums for decision making are becoming important (e.g., in some contexts regulation is being supplemented or replaced by markets and cooperative arrangements). New ways of governing in relation to the environment have important implications for the practice of conservation. Greater awareness of key ideas and concepts of environmental governance can help conservation managers and scientists participate more effectively in governance processes. Understanding how conservation practice is influenced by emergent hybrid and network governance arrangements is particularly important. This short review explores key environmental governance concepts relevant to the practice of conservation, with specific reference to institutional fit and scale; adaptiveness, flexibility and learning; the coproduction of knowledge from diverse sources; the emergence of new actors and their roles in governance; and changing expectations about accountability and legitimacy. Case-based examples highlight key directions in environmental governance.

TI Health and environmental governance for sustainable development
SO CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
AB The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, will address the challenges for sustainable development (SD), 'green economy and poverty eradication' and the 'institutional structure of sustainable development'. Therefore it will address the governance needed to achieve such goals. This paper discusses the structure of global, regional and national governance of and for health and environment in the context of SD. Among other global actions, the Millenium Development Goals were a significant recent political effort, but despite its advances, it fails when ignores the structural causes of production and consumption patterns and the unequal distribution of power, which are responsible for inequities and impede true development. To achieve SD, proposals must avoid reductionism, advancing conceptually and methodologically to face the challenges of the socio-environmental determinants of health through intersectoral action, including social participation and all levels of government. It is paramount to continue the implementation of Agenda 21, to meet the MDGs and to create 'Sustainable Development Goals'. Regarding the health field, Rio+20 Summit must reassure the connection between health and sustainability - as a part of the Social pillar of sustainable development - inspiring politics and actions in multiple levels.

TI When have violent civil conflicts spread? Introducing a dataset of
   substate conflict contagion
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB The spread, diffusion, spillover, or contagion of violent civil conflict - including insurgencies, coups, or other internal armed conflict - across international borders is of great concern to civil war scholars and international security policymakers alike. For instance, great power military interventions are often predicated in part on the belief that if a given conflict is not stopped now, it may spread and destabilize an entire region. Nevertheless, our understanding of this phenomenon of substate conflict contagion' is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive and accurate universe of cases. In this article I introduce an original dataset of cases and non-cases of substate conflict contagion between 1946 and 2007. The key difference between my dataset and other datasets of this phenomenon is that I require in my definition of contagion not only the spatial and temporal proximity of two conflicts, but also a documented causal link between them. After introducing the dataset and the process by which it was constructed, I show that substate conflict contagion by my definition is significantly less common than previous scholarship and policymaker rhetoric suggest, and that its correlates - and potentially the best methods with which to measure those correlates - are different from prior research as well. Policy implications are considered, and applications of this dataset for future conflict research are explored.

TI Terrorism, Spoiling, and the Resolution of Civil Wars
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB Civil war combatants use terrorism frequently, yet we understand little about terrorism's effects on war resolution. It is assumed that the primary combatants to a war hold a veto over resolution, but less attention has been devoted to whether the use of terrorism can derail peace agreements. We contend that even terrorism, a generally low intensity form of violence, can make civil war peace processes less likely to conclude in a peaceful, durable resolution. Using a new and large geographically coded database of terrorism in civil wars, we find that the use of terrorism can spoil peace processes by prolonging the duration of a war hastening the time until recurrence. Our argument and results add to the literature on civil wars by explicating the process linking terrorism to war duration and outcome. More generally, the results underscore the importance of investigating different varieties of political violence during civil conflict.

TI Does Foreign Development Aid Trigger Ethnic War in Developing States?
SO ARMED FORCES & SOCIETY
AB Can foreign aid trigger ethnic war? The quantitative conflict literature has produced mixed findings on the effect of foreign aid on civil war in developing states. One reason for the mixed results is that a subset of civil wars, ethnic wars, are more likely than other kinds of civil wars to be triggered by foreign aid. This is because large amounts of foreign aid can cause the state to become a prize worth fighting over, mobilizing ethnic identity and group-related rebellion. This article investigates this question by testing the separate impacts of total, bilateral, and multilateral aid given by state and nonstate actors on the onset of ethnic war, using a cross-national time-series dataset of 147 countries from 1961 to 2008. The findings show a very strong association of foreign aid with ethnic war, whether measured as total aid, bilateral aid, or multilateral aid.

TI Square Pegs in Round Holes: Inequalities, Grievances, and Civil War
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB Much of the recent research on civil war treats explanations rooted in political and economic grievances with considerable suspicion and claims that there is little empirical evidence of any relationship between ethnicity or inequality and political violence. We argue that common indicators used in previous research, such as the ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF) and the Gini coefficient for income dispersion, fail to capture fundamental aspects of political exclusion and economic inequality that can motivate conflict. Drawing on insights from group-level research, we develop new country-level indices that directly reflect inequalities among ethnic groups, including political discrimination and wealth differentials along ethnic lines. Our analysis reveals that these theoretically informed country profiles are much better predictors of civil war onset than conventional inequality indicators, even when we control for a number of alternative factors potentially related to grievances or opportunities for conflict.

TI Earth System Law for the Anthropocene
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Law has failed to address the ever-deepening socio-ecological crisis of the Anthropocene. In the light of, and as a response to, law's failures in this respect, this paper argues in support of developing a new legal paradigm for the Anthropocene epoch called Earth system law. It does so first by briefly describing the Anthropocene trope and the extent and dimensions of its socio-ecological crisis. The paper then specifically focuses on international environmental law as an example of how and why law has become incapable of, and inappropriate for, addressing this crisis, and for being unable to respond to the Anthropocene's regulatory demands. By drawing on three Earth system-related regulatory implications of the Anthropocene trope (i.e., inclusivity, interdependencies and complexity), the final part of the paper makes out a case in support of reforming law and creating a new Earth system oriented legal paradigm that is fit for purpose in the Anthropocene epoch.

TI The legacy of country-level experience of armed conflict on emancipative
   value preferences: A global cross-national study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY
AB This study examines the legacies of large-scale armed conflict on emancipative value preferences from 1946 to 2012. The multilevel analysis indicates that people living in countries with past armed conflict are more likely to endorse less emancipative value preferences. The higher the intensity and the longer the duration of the armed conflict episodes experienced in a country, the greater the impact on values. Our evidence further suggests that the mechanism through which armed conflict shapes values is by diminishing/destructing the material, intellectual, and connective resources available to a society. These findings show that armed conflict legacies are bleaker than previous studies on individual exposure to violence have suggested. Large-scale violence diminishes people's ability and motivation to pursue a life free from domination, potentially eroding the basis of generalized tolerance and cooperation.

TI The Legal Basis of Public Participation in the International
   Environmental Governance as a Requirement for Sustainable Development
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The paper focuses on the global environmental governance and features of public participation as an integral element of sustainable development. Recently, sustainable development and environmental governance have become interrelated elements of social development. The requirements to strengthen the role of civil society, especially representatives of the public, under the new or reformed system of international environmental governance are important issue of the article. The civil society should play a major role in five key areas: collection and dissemination; policy development consultation; implementation of environmental policy; monitoring and evaluation; promotion of environmental justice. The author defines the features of powers' separation between the actors in international environmental governance, enlightens the question of the public environmental management and its role in environmental decision-making. Thus, determination of the usefulness of the international environmental governance model for the national systems of law is up to date. The research of the peculiarities of the realization of public participation in the international environmental governance is consider to be of the highest relevance, and the development of public environmental management as a distinct element of environmental governance is the issue for the further investigations.

TI Paradise is a bazaar? Greed, creed, and governance in civil war, 1989-99
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Some prominent recent studies of civil war argue that greed, not grievance, is the primary motivating factor behind violence, basing their conclusions on a strong empirical association between primary commodity exports and civil war. This study contrasts alternative propositions that see need-, creed-, and governance-based explanations that are intimately related to the question of primary commodity dependence and conflict. Maximum likelihood analysis on approximately 138 countries over the entire post-Cold War period shows little support for neo-Malthusian claims. Abundant mineral wealth makes countries highly unstable, whereas scarcity of renewable resources is largely unrelated to civil conflict. A positive effect of population density on conflict does not seem to be conditioned by renewable resource scarcity. Ethnicity is related to conflict when society is moderately homogenous; a highly plural society faces less risk. Very slight political liberalization leads to conflict, but larger increases reduce the danger considerably, supporting the view that conflict is driven by opportunistic behaviour rather than by grievance. Increases in homogeneity among Islamic and Catholic populations make them riskier. Perhaps institutional factors relating to separation of church and state rather than competing creeds explain culture conflicts. Larger shares of both Christians and Muslims within countries make them safer, contrary to claims of natural antagonism between the two. Governance, proxied by the ratio of total trade to GDP, predicts peace strongly, an under-theorized area within the study of civil war. Trade's relationship to peace is robust to specification and sample size, supporting the findings of the State Failure Project. Greater attention should perhaps be paid to formal and informal institutional factors that create the synergy between private and public spaces for overcoming collective action problems of maintaining peace.

TI Simulating the Linkages Between Economy and Armed Conflict in India With
   a Long Short-Term Memory Algorithm
SO RISK ANALYSIS
AB This article analyzes the linkages between the economy and armed conflict in India using annual frequency data for the period 1989-2016, the maximum time period for which consistent data are available for the country. An adequate set of economic indicators was established to fully reflect the economic condition. Long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a machine-learning algorithm for time series, was employed to simulate the relationship between the economy and armed conflict events. In addition, LSTM was applied to predict the trend of armed conflict with two strategies: multiyear predictions and yearly predictions. The results show that both strategies can adequately simulate the relationship between the economy and armed conflict, with all simulation accuracies above 90%. The accuracy of the yearly prediction is higher than that of the multiyear prediction. Theoretically, the future state and trend of armed conflict can be predicted with LSTM and future economic data if future economic data can be predicted.

SO WOMEN IN PEACEMAKING AND PEACEBUILDING IN NORTHERN UGANDA
SE Anthropocene-Politik Economics Society Science
AB The ceasefire agreement signed in August 2006 between the Ugandan government and the Lord's Resistance Army ended two decades of armed conflict. The efforts of many actors contributed to bringing fighting in northern Uganda to a close. The role of women in conflict resolution is often not publicly recognised or acknowledged, but in northern Uganda women have been important actors in peacemaking as well as peacebuilding processes. They have done so by organizing themselves into a civic force and assuming roles as advocates, negotiators and, most importantly, community peacemakers and peacebuilders. Remarkable contributions made by women to the peace process were during the stalemated Juba peace talks, when they arrived and presented the Peace Torch to representatives in the conflict, who on the occasion shook hands for the first time. Many informal peacebuilding initiatives were created by women that significantly responded to the problems of resettlement and reintegration of ex-combatants and children returning from captivity. This created an enabling environment for sustainable peace at the grass-roots level. Their initiatives and non-violent actions offer lessons for everyone trying to resolve civil conflicts in Africa.

AB Civil conflict appears to be contagiousscholars have shown that civil wars in a state's neighborhood make citizens more likely to rebel at home. However, war occurs when both rebels and the state engage in conflict. How do state authorities respond to the potential for civil conflict to spread? We argue that elites will anticipate the incentive-altering effects of civil wars abroad and increase repression at home to preempt potential rebellion. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model and spatially weighted conflict measures, we find robust evidence that a state will engage in higher levels of human rights violations as civil war becomes more prevalent in its geographic proximity. We thus find evidence that states violate rights as a function of the internal politics of other states. Further, we argue authorities will act not to mimic their neighbors but rather to avoid their fate.

TI Buying Peace? Oil Wealth, Corruption and Civil War, 1985-99
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB This article argues that, contrary to received wisdom, political corruption is not necessarily associated with a higher risk of civil war in oil-rich states. Political corruption can be used to accommodate opposition and placate restive groups by offering private privilege in exchange for political loyalty. Since oil wealth is associated with large rents accruing in state treasuries, it provides an economic foundation for such clientelist rule. This article thus argues that oil-rich governments can use political corruption to buy support from key segments of society, effectively outspending other entrepreneurs of violence. Based on a logit analysis of civil war onsets, 1985-99, the article finds support for this 'co-optation argument'. A negative and statistically significant interaction term between oil production and political corruption is consistent across different models and robust to a number of specifications. While both variables per se increase the risk of conflict overall, higher levels of corruption seem to weaken the harmful impact of oil on the risk of civil war. This finding suggests the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between natural resource wealth, governance and armed conflict. Political corruption has prolonged poverty and bred economic and political inequality in many oil-rich states, but it has also helped cement powerful alliances with a stake in the continuation of the corrupt regimes.

SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Existing literature on civil wars relies predominantly on state- and organization-level variables to understand conflict dynamics and outcomes. In this article, we propose that rebel leaders' personal backgrounds and experiences are also key to explaining the behavior of the organizations they lead. Just as scholars have long highlighted the importance of state leaders' biographical characteristics in interstate war and diplomacy, we argue that the attributes of rebel leaders affect their organizations' decisions and actions in civil war. To substantiate our claims, we introduce the Rebel Organization Leaders (ROLE) database, which contains a wide range of biographical information on all top rebel leaders in civil wars ongoing between 1980 and 2011. We first describe the contents of the database and present a number of novel descriptive findings about rebel leaders. To illustrate its utility, we then examine the influence of rebel leaders' attributes on their organizations' use of terrorism in civil war. Ultimately, our work encourages - and enables - a new research agenda that goes beyond rebel organizations and campaigns as units of analysis and brings individual leaders more fully into modern conflict and peace studies.

TI Drivers of (in)equity in collaborative environmental governance
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
AB Collaborative environmental governance seeks to engage diverse stakeholders to tackle complex challenges efficiently, sustainably, and equitably. However, mixed empirical evidence underscores a need to understand the conditions under which particularly equity is or is not achieved. Here, we use the empirical case of California Sustainable Groundwater Management to quantify the extent to which vulnerable small and rural drinking water users' needs are addressed in collaborative groundwater planning. Drawing on a diverse array of mixed method data, we then employ Boosted Regression and Classification Trees (BRCT) to assess potential driving factors including collaboration, representation, elite capture, stakeholder engagement, and problem severity/salience. We find each to be influential, highlighting their relevance for equitable planning. We also find evidence that these relationships are complex and outcome specific. Nonetheless, the overall effect on the three equity measures is modest at best. More institutional analysis of collaborative governance regimes from diverse contexts is needed to build a comprehensive understanding of how to meaningfully advance social and environmental equity in such decentralized reforms. Based on our results, we suggest the answer, if there is one, may transcend current focal domains such as stakeholder representation and engagement.

TI Twisting arms and sending messages: Terrorist tactics in civil war
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB We examine the strategic rationale for terrorist tactics in civil war. We identify conditions that favor terrorism as a tactic in armed civil conflicts as well as the specific targets as a function of rebel characteristics, goals, and government responses to political demands. Terrorist tactics can be helpful as an instrument to coerce the government in asymmetric conflicts, as rebels are typically weak relative to the government. But terrorism can also help communicate the goals and resolve of a group when there is widespread uncertainty. We consider the strategic importance and rationale for terrorism in terms of the frequency of attacks and specific targets, and analyze our propositions using new data linking actors from the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Data and the Global Terrorism Database. Consistent with our expectations, we find that terrorism is used more extensively in civil conflicts by weaker groups and when attacks can help the group convey its goals without undermining popular support. Groups with more inclusive audiences are more likely to focus on hard' or official targets, while groups with more sectarian audiences are more likely to attack soft' targets and civilians.

TI Evidential reasoning rule for environmental governance cost prediction
   with considering causal relationship and data reliability
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Environmental governance cost prediction can avoid blind investment and waste of resources and achieve effective cost planning for sustainable development of resources and environment. For the sake of solving the problem that most previous studies failed to consider the causal relationship and data reliability of environmental governance inputs and outputs, a new environmental governance cost prediction method is proposed under the framework of the evidential reasoning (ER) rule with three improvements comparing to existing methods: (1) the causal relationship of environmental governance inputs and outputs is embedded into evidence representation for better extracting knowledge from data; (2) the efficiency about the minimum inputs to achieve the maximum outputs is used to evaluate the data reliability of environmental governance inputs and outputs; and (3) a new analytical ER rule is investigated to optimize the process of evidence combination. Hence, the new method includes the calculation of belief distributions, evidence reliabilities, and evidence weights, as well as the combination of evidences to predict environmental governance costs. In the case study, the data of 30 provinces in Mainland China from 2005 to 2020 are collected to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Results show a high level of accuracy of the new method over other existing methods.

TI Financing discord: International support for rebel groups as a
   counterforce to civil conflict resolution
SO ETUDES INTERNATIONALES
AB State sponsorship of rebel groups is a recurring phenomenon of contemporary civil wars. However, these rebellions are often relatively unlikely to succeed, even if they are financed by powerful states. Why do states support rebel causes with such limited chances of success ? This article looks into this paradox by suggesting that states often do not seek to help the rebel enterprise, but to weaken a rival country by provoking a civil war or intensifying an existing one. The analysis with a formal model shows that foreign support to rebel groups can act as a counterforce that prohibits institutional conflict resolution. The historical relationship between Russians and Turkish Kurds is analyzed with these new theoretical insights.

TI The failure of a liberal peace: Sri Lanka's counter-insurgency in global
   perspective
SO CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
AB The victory by the Sri Lankan government over the LTTE in 2009 apparently ended over 25 years of civil war. However, the ramifications of the government's counterinsurgency go far beyond Sri Lanka's domestic politics. The military campaign against the LTTE poses a significant challenge to many of the liberal norms that inform contemporary models of international peace-building-the so-called ' liberal peace'. This article suggests that Sri Lanka's attempts to justify a shift from peaceful conflict resolution to counter-insurgency relied on three main factors: the flawed nature of the peace process, which highlighted wider concerns about the mechanisms and principles of international peace processes; the increased influence of 'Rising Powers', particularly China, in global governance mechanisms, and their impact on international norms related to conflict management; and the use by the government of a discourse of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency to limit international censure. The article concludes that the Sri Lankan case may suggest a growing contestation of international peace-building norms, and the emergence of a legitimated 'illiberal peace'.

AB Conflict management, especially when taking into consideration civil war or international violent conflict, can be effective and sustainable only when it is rooted in local social structures. Civil society actors can be agents of peace or, on the contrary, can bring about conflict escalation and violence. Economic and social development should be included in conflict management strategies. However, very often this becomes a dividing factor when development is not inclusive and its benefits are not distributed fairly. Disrespect for human dignity is often what escalates a conflict. On the other hand, education, employment, and prospects for a better life are what motivate people to build peace. Development organizations apply "Do No Harm" principles so as not to contribute to local conflicts by unfair distribution of resources or power. It is crucial to build peace via the action of local people who have already got the trust of their communities (community leaders, mobilizers, teachers, elders, etc.). Such people or organizations, especially if have done any kind of successful community development work before, have the potential to be "the connectors" in resolving the conflict. Peace can be achieved neither from outside nor from above. Nevertheless, conflict may serve as a catalyst to mobilize civil society. The growth of volunteerism and social activism in Ukraine serves as proof. International assistance in conflict management should focus on strengthening the local capacities for building peace.

SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB The article rethinks the relationship between human trafficking as organised crime and child recruitment as a war crime. After analysing the records of 132 cases of child and adolescent recruitment brought before Colombia's ordinary justice system between 2008 and 2016, it became clear that the youngsters involved had performed activities both directly and indirectly related to the conflict, but also that they had been exploited and maltreated, with no control over their situation. Reassessment of the relationship between human trafficking and child recruitment could result in more effective justice for this population by shedding light on alternate ways to construct reparation and reintegration.

TI How does anti-corruption policy affect the sensitivity of green
   innovation to executive incentives?
SO ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING
AB Due to the unique contribution it makes to both environmental and financial performances, green innovation has become a key factor driving organizations to achieve sustainable development. Policy change presents a good opportunity to discover the drivers of corporate behavior. Considering the way in which anti-corruption policy can affect firms' innovation environment and innovation decisions, this research takes China's anti-corruption policy as a shock condition and conducts a quasi-experiment to discuss the impact of anti-corruption policy on the sensitivity of green innovation to executive incentives in China. The main findings reveal that anti-corruption policy significantly improves the sensitivity of green innovation to equity incentives and decreases the sensitivity to control rights incentives, but does not influence the sensitivity to reputation incentives. These findings show the integrated impact of an exogenous environment and endogenous governance upon green innovation. We also reveal the difference of this integrated impact in the context of various natures of ownership. Specifically, in private enterprises, anti-corruption policy can optimize the sensitivity of green innovation to equity incentives, while in state-owned enterprises the sensitivity of green innovation to reputation incentives combined with equity incentives or with control rights incentives significantly improves. The findings presented in this paper reveal the micro-economic effects of anti-corruption policy on green innovation and instruct firms to optimize executive incentive arrangements to green development under the background of China's anti-corruption campaign.

TI Defining civil war by examining post-Soviet conflicts
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB Great many violent events happened during 1991 2005 in the 12 slates that emerged after the collapse of the USSR but only a few civil wars tire registered in the major datasets. That brings up a number of questions about the operational definitions of civil war that generally point in the direction of shifting the research attention from refining the quantitative parameters to grasping the essense of the phenomena in question. It is proposed that civil war partially overlaps with several other type of violent crisis: inter-state wars, civil unrest and revolutions, internal repression, military coups and mutinies, banditry and organized crime, and terrorism. These overlaps create six 'gray zones' where only very nuanced examination rather than application of rigid criteria could help in distinguishing civil wars,from other crises. Therefore, data collection based on a single "robust" definition, which incorporates several verifiable parameters, is not nceessarily the only path to scientific knowledge about civil wars.

TI The surprising decline of international mediation in armed conflicts
SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
AB We identify and investigate a fundamental puzzle in contemporary mediation of armed conflicts. Although the preparedness of international mediators has increased, the proportion of armed conflicts that receive mediation has not increased, but decreased. Using quantitative data on the occurrence of mediation between 1989 and 2013, our analysis suggests that this puzzling contradiction cannot be explained by conflicts being more fragmented, intractable or internationalized. Instead, we argue that the puzzling decline of mediation can be explained by a mismatch between supply and demand in the international mediation 'market'. Although there are more mediators available, the rise in the number of conflicts involving Islamist armed actors, coupled with increased reliance on terror-listing, especially since 2001, has placed a growing number of conflicts beyond the reach of international mediators. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that the post-Cold War era is characterized by high mediation rates and point to the need to develop the practice of mediation to maintain its relevance in the contemporary conflict landscape.

TI Producing Localized Commodity Frontiers at the End of Cheap Nature: An
   Analysis of Eco-scalar Carbon Fixes and their Consequences
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
AB There is no single great' commodity frontier whose exploitation under current socio-technical conditions could fuel capital accumulation at the global scale. According to Jason Moore, this represents the end of Cheap Nature' and signals a terminal crisis for capitalism as we know it. In this article we complicate this assertion by showing how, in the context of global environmental governance frameworks of carbon control, a diverse range of actors situated at multiple scales are intensifying the use of cities and their hinterlands for the production/transgression of localized commodity frontiers. We draw on scholarship on uneven geographical development, state-led restructuring and eco-scalar fixes to present two case studies from different segments of the carbon cycle in the global South. The first case demonstrates how the introduction of waste-to-energy technology in Delhi facilitated the generation of carbon credits' while waste matter itself became a commodity. The second discusses attempts by the Brazilian state of Amazonas (Amazonia) aspiring to shift from rainforest exploitation to financialized conservation supported by the green global city' functions of metropolitan Manaus. These cases demonstrate that although the global carbon-control regime may enable accumulation, implementation remains speculative, and localized commodity frontiers provoke social resistances that jeopardize their durability.

AB Human trafficking is a global, multibillion-dollar industry. Most victims are female and more than half are children. At-risk youth continue to attend school with school nurses on the front-line of this health crisis. Using the Peace and Power Conceptual Model, a mixed-methods study was conducted to explore school nurses' awareness, attitudes, and role perceptions in the prevention of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Six peace-power versus power-over power themes and 4 subthemes were identified: "exposure/knowledge, "collaboration," "role boundaries," and "creating respite space." Policy efforts should focus on improving practice conditions for school nurses to support the prevention of commercial sexual exploitation of children.

AB Colombia has endured one of the longest armed conflicts in the world, influencing land use, local economies, and the environment. The Department of Cordoba, which is part of the Colombian Caribbean region, was a setting of territorial disputes between illegal armed groups. Recently, peace agreements have been reached, thereby leading to a post-conflict period in which conflict-driven socioeconomic and environmental conditions need to be addressed. We used geoenvironmental satellite information and census data to describe land-use evolution in the Department of Cordoba. Our results explain relationships between socioeconomic and geographic variables by using two factors, namely: (1) natural land cover and armed conflict, and (2) pastures and livestock. Five clusters comprised of smaller Colombian territorial units were obtained, exhibiting challenges of environmental governance, conservation of protected areas, and sustainable livestock and agricultural practices. This information provides critical input for institutional decisions during the current post-conflict period.

TI Transnational dimensions of civil war
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Existing research has related civil war primarily to country-specific factors or processes that take place within individual states experiencing conflict. Many contemporary civil wars, however, display a transnational character, where actors, resources, and events span national boundaries. This article challenges the 'closed polity' approach to the study of civil war, where individual states are treated as independent entities, and posits that transnational factors and linkages between states can exert strong influences on the risk of violent civil conflict. Previous research has shown that conflicts in a state's regional context can increase the risk of conflict, but the research has not distinguished between different varieties of transnational linkages that may underlie geographic contagion, and it has failed to consider the potential influences of domestic attributes. The article develops and evaluates a series of hypotheses on how transnational factors can influence the risk of conflict and the prospects for maintaining peace in a conditional autologistic model, including country-specific factors often associated with civil wars. The results suggest that transnational linkages between states and regional factors strongly influence the risk of civil conflict. This, in turn, implies that the risk of civil war is not determined just by a country's internal or domestic characteristics, but differs fundamentally, depending on a country's linkages to other states.

TI Can Domestic Environmental Courts Implement International Environmental
   Law? A Framework for Institutional Analysis
SO TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
AB The rapid and widespread establishment of domestic environmental courts and tribunals raises important questions regarding their implications for international environmental law and global environmental governance. I use an interdisciplinary, multi-method approach to consider the capacity of domestic environmental courts to identify and apply norms and principles of international environmental law in domestic opinions. I first review existing literature, identifying jurisdiction, judicial discretion, and a court's position in a legal system as key institutional determinants of this capacity. I then develop a typology of domestic environmental courts and tribunals, which suggests that, all else being equal, a court with national geographic jurisdiction that also enjoys attributes of broad subject-matter jurisdiction and discretion may be expected to be best equipped to implement norms and principles of international environmental law. Next, I integrate existing assessments of environmental court presence with original outreach and web research to identify all countries which possess environmental courts, and assess a subset of eight existing national-level institutions. The analysis of this subset highlights the diversity of institutional models that can incorporate theorized best practices. Based on these findings, I draw several theoretical conclusions: specifically (i) the relevance of environmental court research to individual- and institutional-level analysis in transnational and international environmental law, (ii) the need for further legal-institutional analysis in global environmental governance scholarship, and (iii) the opportunity for further interdisciplinary analysis of the role of domestic courts in environmental governance.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB China's idea of a community of a shared future for humanity (CSFH) has become the guiding principle and norm to be further embedded and integrated into the country's approach to environmental governance. Under the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, China strongly emphasizes the implementation of its national strategy to mitigate the global climate crisis, and construct international environmental institutions by advocating fair cooperation resulting in mutual gain. China's role as a responsible major country is expected to be more proactive in international process. In particular, the concept of CSFH exerts positive, far-reaching impacts on the greening of the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of solid South-South relations. Based on the renewed perception, China shall undertake its responsibilities in the reform of the global environmental governance system by leading multilateralism to strengthen the capacity of relevant international institutions such as the UN. Driven by China's political will, this concept reflects China's more confident attitude toward global environmental governance. Most profoundly, mainstreaming the vision of CSFH will elevate China's role to a new level in the coming years in terms of norm creation in international environmental institutions.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB The climate of impunity in many post-civil conflict societies results in unprecedented levels of violence against women, making legal implementation and law enforcement particularly difficult. We argue that the presence of strong legal provisions mediates the negative influence of the post-civil conflict environment on violence against women. Specifically, we examine the role of strong legal protections on the enforcement of sexual violence legislation in post-civil conflict countries. To examine our hypothesis, we utilize an original dataset measuring the strength and enforcement of domestic legal statutes addressing violence against women for the years 2007-2010 in post-civil conflict countries. We find elements of civil conflict as well as domestic and international legal regimes to be reliably associated with the enforcement of violence against women laws and rape prevalence in post-civil conflict states.

TI Not to mislead peace: on the demise of identity politics in Iraq
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB By drawing on theories of transition to democracy, social value shifts and recent studies on Iraqi politics and society, this article offers a critical standpoint on the alleged demise/death of identity politics in Iraq. The article suggests that the sort of societal transformation that is indispensable to the demise of 'aggressive sectarianism', ethnic nationalism and the oppression of minority groups has not yet occurred. Any value changes favouring the consolidation of citizenship values and the formation of an Iraqi identity require, among other conditions, a stable, sustainable and steady move towards democratisation, good governance and a broader, often lengthy, process of social and economic transformations. The article therefore contends that any attempt at peace in the country necessitates addressing peace as (1) a fundamental matter of governance and (2) an everyday practice in the local terrain. Regarding state-building and governance, the article suggests that 'rectifying' the post-2003 trend may have adverse consequences should the process run in the direction of retreat from democracy and a rigid re-centralisation of the country. While Iraq's 'the local', increasingly vibrant, its constructive impacts on formal politics and peacebuilding, remain uncertain.

How groups assign blame affects the potential for reconciliation. Very different justifications are offered by those affected by conflict. These discourses of legitimation help to explain the conflict, and provide a narrative for the hostilities/war. For Georgian internally displaced persons, the blame for the conflict falls on Russia. For Abkhazians, the blame is placed on Georgians. Although both discourses are different, they each displace blame from themselves and their own agency and actions that played a significant role in the conflict, as well as in some of the atrocities that have been documented to have taken place on both sides.

Samples (14,447 children aged 5 years or younger) are extracted from the 1996, 2001, 2006 Demographic and Health Surveys. The results from mother fixed effects regression show that exposure has modest but significantly negative impacts on height of children under age 5 on the intensive margin. Conditional on average months of exposure to war violence of the study sample, the height of children decreases by 0.08 standard deviation. In particular, this negative health impact is statistically significant and similar across the whole height distribution.

AB Identifying challenges and opportunities for REDD+ will help to inform future policy and implementation of the program in Indonesia and other countries. The aim of this research is to identify and elucidate challenges and opportunities for REDD+ and other environmental governance initiatives. We present the perceptions of stakeholders and practitioners involved in REDD+ in Indonesia at multiple scales varying from global to local. Our research demonstrates stakeholders are struggling with problems of bureaucracy and a lack of confidence in REDD+, in addition to problems surrounding funding, logistics of implementation, corruption, stakeholder engagement and buy-in. Ultimately, our respondents and supporting documents reflect the particularly complex cultural and governance contexts in Indonesia. Despite challenges, REDD+ may have increased attention to these issues and acted as a catalyst for change. Effective implementation of REDD+ projects in Indonesia will require both nuanced understanding of the local and cultural context as well as long-term perspectives.

TI Scarcity-Induced Domestic Conflict: Examining the Interactive Effects of
   Environmental Scarcity and 'Ethnic' Population Pressures
SO CIVIL WARS
AB This study argues that environmental scarcity is more likely to result in civil conflict in countries that experience 'ethnic' population pressures (i.e. where the size of the largest minority group is close to parity with the majority group). I refer to this argument as the 'parity-threat' approach to the study of scarcity-induced domestic conflict. I empirically test my argument by analysing time-series cross-section data for the period 1979-2000 using four alternative environmental indicators: (1) ecological footprint, (2) biocapacity, (3) scarcity of ecological reserves and (4) water scarcity. The results demonstrate that environmental scarcity increases the probability of civil conflict when conditioned by 'ethnic' population pressures.

TI The application of Geographical Information Systems to armed violent
   conflict resolution and peacebuilding: a literature review
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
AB Many conventional approaches to resolving armed violent conflicts, including negotiations, peace talks, and stabilization, have been adopted, especially in Asia and Africa, but sustainable peace is still illusive in some of these areas. Most of these approaches emphasize the economic and political aspects of peace negotiations and tend to ignore the spatial component. There are several innovative technologies, such as smart cell phones, the internet, Global Position Systems (GPS), and satellite data for mapping armed violent conflict resolution. However, GIS has been recognized as an invaluable tool, a decision support system, and has the potential to assist in conflict resolution. This paper aims to review literature on the application of GIS in the prevention of armed violent conflict, its resolution, post-conflict reconstruction, and peacebuilding. The literature review reveals that while GIS continues to be applied in armed violent conflict resolution and peacebuilding, several challenges remain, including amongst others, its availability, its acceptance by conflicting parties, its accessibility, the accuracy of its data, and the expertise of GIS personnel undertaking the data analysis and integration of data from different sources. A suggested area of further study includes either the application of remote sensing to violent conflict resolution or an integrated application of GIS and Remote Sensing to armed conflict resolution.

TI Terrorism and Organised Crime: Co-operative Endeavours in Scotland?
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB It has been suggested that a nexus between terrorist groups and those involved in organised crime exists. This study explores the co-operative possibilities that exist between these phenomena, focusing specifically on the level of assistance participants in organised criminal activity might provide to those engaged in terrorism, the "initial nexus." This was achieved initially through interviews with subject matter experts with knowledge of the organised crime and counter terrorism situation in Scotland. Thereafter, law enforcement personnel who investigate serious and organised crime were interviewed, and their opinions sought in respect of the likely actions of those they investigate. The data gathered is subject to analysis and comment are provided as to what level of co-operation between those involved in organised crime and terrorism can be expected; what motivational factors may have a bearing on the level of co-operation provided; and discussion of "tipping points," ethical or otherwise, where the withdrawal of co-operation could occur, providing opportunities for increasingly successful law enforcement intervention.

TI The Homegrown Threat: State Strength, Grievance, and Domestic Terrorism
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB Scholars maintain that, similar to insurgency, terrorist violence is precipitated by both relative deprivation and state weakness. Yet aggrieved minority groups within a country should turn to terrorism when they are weak relative to the state rather than strong. Empirical evidence shows minority group discrimination and fragile political institutions to independently increase domestic terror attacks. But it remains unclear whether grievances drive domestic terrorism in both strong and weak states. Using data from 172 countries between 1998 and 2007, we find that for strong states the presence of minority discrimination leads to increased domestic terrorism, while for weak states the presence of minority discrimination actually leads to less domestic terrorism. Consequently, increasing state capacity may not be a panacea for antistate violence, as nonstate actors may simply change their strategy from insurgency or guerrilla warfare to terrorism. Efforts to reduce terrorist violence must focus on reducing grievance by eliminating discriminatory policies at the same time that measures to improve state capacity are enacted.

AB The European Union (EU) draw up a strategic for the time period 2011-2014 related to corporate social responsibility. In this vein, it is published the Directive 2014/95/UE about non financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups. This directive is focused on the importance of businesses divulging information on sustainability such as environmental, social and employees matters, related to human rights, anti-corruption and bribery aspects. According to the above arguments, the purpose of this investigation is to analyze the non-financial information about anti-corruption and bribery through a disclosure index in European firms. Namely, we have analyzed the Eurostoxx 50 in 2017 in order to know the disclosure of information related to the above directive about the fight against corruption and bribery. We find that the level of corruption and bribery disclosure in our firm sample is around sixty percent. In particular, the corruption and bribery aspects more disclosed are related to the anti-corruption policies, procedures and standards; internal and external control processes and resources allocated to preventing corruption and bribery; and criteria used in corruption related to risk assessments. Together, these results have public policy implications because they suggest that firm are responding to the disclosure of corruption and bribery information. However, we should highlight that there is still a long way to get disclosure about corruption and bribery from all companies.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This article provides evidence and a rationale based on adaptive governance studies for why creating meaningful youth engagement should be understood in terms of intergenerational dialogue, collaboration, learning, and substantive decision-making in global environmental governance. We have centered our discussion on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the largest global conservation organization. Through an organizational ethnography approach, we have demonstrated how generational concerns within the IUCN have been framed in terms of participation, and then present the IUCN Intergenerational Partnership for Sustainability (IPS) as a case study of a grassroots movement that is focused on transforming the IUCN towards being a fully intergenerational global governance system for nature conservation. We have described the development of intergenerational thinking and action within the IUCN, and discussed intergenerational governance as being essential for addressing nature conservation challenges faced by local communities in times of increasing global uncertainty. We conclude by providing recommendations for enhancing intergenerational dialogue and building intergenerational governance structures within global conservation organizations.

AB Over the last 30 years significant efforts have been made to ensure that Public Administration: An International Quarterly lives up to its international title. In this review article, we highlight some of the key research articles that have been published by the journal which illustrate an international approach to the study of public administration. We show how the journal's historical inclusion of a diverse spectrum of philosophies, methodologies, theories and contexts has contributed to this internationalization. In doing so the journal has contributed to our understanding of equity, social justice and inclusion; ethics, public value and corruption; networks, governance and participation; and environmental governance and crisis management. This historical review also reveals how global challenges, particularly as a consequence of the climate emergency, drive the transnationalization of public administration, which in turn requires further international scholarship.

TI Rights, equity and justice: A diagnostic for social meta-norm diffusion
   in environmental governance
SO EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
AB Social meta-norms, including human rights, gender equality, equity and environmental justice, are mainstream principles of good environmental governance. The permeation of social meta-norms through global environmental goals, policies and agreements (e.g., the Sustainable Development Goals) is now generally accepted to be critical to the integrity of the Earth's system and to social dignity and opportunities for humanity. Yet, little is known about how globally articulated social meta-norms lead to shifts in action at other scales of governance. Specifically, analysis of the discursive and dynamic nature of social meta-norm diffusion is lacking. To build a better understanding of what shapes the diffusion of social meta-norms across different scales of environmental governance, we provide a synthesis that bridges political and sociological theory and underscores the critical role of agency in the diffusion process. We identify eight drivers of diffusion along a spectrum that ranges from prescriptive drivers, which leave little space for norm negotiation, to discursive drivers, which provide an enabling space for norm interpretation. We hypothesize these drivers intersect with a parallel spectrum of actor responses, ranging from complete resistance to social meta-norms at one end, to complete internalization of social meta-norms at the other. Our diagnostic of integrated drivers and responses is aimed at advancing conventional norm diffusion theory by providing a better account of discursive forces in this process. Applying these diagnostic elements to future empirical research has the potential to improve the rationale, speed, mode and impact of social meta-norm diffusion in multiscale environmental governance.

TI Civil wars kill and maim people - Long after the shooting stops
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Political scientists have conducted only limited systematic research on the consequences of war for civilian populations. Here we argue that the civilian suffering caused by civil war extends well beyond the period of active warfare. We examine these longer-term affects in a cross-national (1999) analysis of World Health Organization new fine-grained data on death and disability broken down by age, gender, and type of disease or condition. We test hypotheses about the impact of civil wars and find substantial long-term effects, even after controlling for several other factors. We estimate that the additional burden of death and disability incurred in 1999, from the indirect and lingering effects of civil wars in the years 1991-97, was approximately equal to that incurred directly and immediately from all wars in 1999. This impact works its way through specific diseases and conditions and disproportionately affects women and children.

TI The public health aspects of complex emergencies and refugee situations
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Populations affected by armed conflict have experienced severe public health consequences mediated by population displacement, food scarcity, and the collapse of basic health services, giving rise to the term complex humanitarian emergencies. These public health effects have been most severe in underdeveloped countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Refugees and internally displaced persons have experienced high mortality rates during the period immediately following their migration. In Africa, crude mortality rates have been as high as 80 times baseline rates. The most common causes of death have been diarrheal diseases, measles, acute respiratory infections, and malaria. High prevalences of acute malnutrition have contributed to high case fatality rates. In conflict-affected European countries, such as the former Yugoslavia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Chechnya, war-related injuries have been the most common cause of death among civilian populations; however, increased incidence of communicable diseases, neonatal health problems, and nutritional deficiencies (especially among the elderly) have been documented. The most effective measures to prevent mortality and morbidity in complex emergencies include protection from violence; the provision of adequate food rations, clean water and sanitation; diarrheal disease control; measles immunization; maternal and child health care, including the case management of common endemic communicable diseases; and selective feeding programs, when indicated.

TI Making Plans for Liberia-a Trusteeship Approach to Good Governance?
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Since the end of the Liberian civil war in August 2003 the international community has been 'making plans' for Liberia. However, it rarely questioned whether these plans were in accordance with the political and economic logic of the peace agreement and the subsequent transitional government. The consequence was that corruption continued and a much more intrusive economic management plan was established. The Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP) is supposed to combat corruption and facilitate good governance, but it also limits the range of policy options for the new democratically elected government of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The irony is that the best and most legitimate government that Liberia has ever had is subject to stronger external control than any of its predecessors. The probability that this scheme will remain sustainable when donor interest shifts elsewhere is low, and what is needed is a more pragmatic approach that draws a wider segment of Liberian society into anti-corruption management and creates checks and balances between them.

TI Securing the social foundation: A rights-based approach to planetary
   boundaries
SO EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
AB The 'planetary boundaries' framework identifies Earth system processes that contribute to the stability and resilience of the planet (Rockstr_om et al., 2009a), setting out the limits to changes the Earth can support for remaining in a Holocene-like state. A key question for global sustainable development that emerges from this framework is how to secure social equity while respecting planetary boundaries. Recent efforts to quantify a 'social foundation' have drawn attention to the necessity of securing human wellbeing in a 'safe and just operating space'. Yet realising the potential of this approach, we suggest, requires addressing two substantial governance challenges: how do we define and analyse success or failure in the integration of social equity in environmental governance systems?; and how do we support the emergence of those voices that are needed to make governance equitable? We argue that human rights offer a widely accepted normative basis for responding to both these questions. The body of rightsbased practice offers an analytical framing and tools for development support at a time when there is an urgent need to engage with the structural problems in environmental governance. Through a rightsbased approach, it becomes possible to identify and address the social relations and mechanisms that generate inequities, and which undermine progress in addressing the unsustainable use of planetary resources at multiple scales. A decade after the planetary boundaries framework first appeared, widespread exploration of the potential of a rights-based approach is overdue. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Democratisation in Africa: The role of self-enforcing constitutional
   rules
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Following several decades during which violent civil conflict was common in African countries, the period from 1990 onwards was marked by a spreading and deepening of adherence to democratic principles. Nonetheless, many African countries still experience political instability and civil unrest. This raises the question of why these countries have not succeeded in resolving conflict in a sustainable manner. Drawing on economic ideas about contracts and institutions, this paper outlines a conceptual framework for thinking about the role of constitutional rules in achieving political stability. It also elucidates a critical requirement for sustainable democratic systems, namely that constitutional rules must become self-sustaining to safeguard such systems and to avoid relapses into violent civil conflict. The experiences of selected African countries are presented as brief case studies that illustrate the relevance of the conceptual framework and the notion of self-enforcing constitutional rules.

Focusing on health adaptation in Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC, we examine whether statistically significant relationships exist between regulatory, institutional, financial, and normative aspects of national-level adaptive capacity and systematically measured adaptation. Specifically, we (i) quantify adaptation actions in Annex I nations, (ii) identify potential factors that might impact progress on adaptation and select measures for these factors, and (iii) calculate statistical relationships between factors and adaptation actions across countries. Statistically significant relationships are found between progress on adaptation and engagement in international environmental governance, national environmental governance, perception of corruption in the public sector, population size, and national wealth, as well as between responsiveness to health vulnerabilities, population size and national wealth. This analysis contributes two key early empirical findings to the growing literature concerning factors facilitating or constraining adaptation. While country size and wealth are necessary for driving higher levels of adaptation, they may be insufficient in the absence of policy commitments to environmental governance. Furthermore, governance and/or incentive frameworks for environmental governance at the national level may be an important indicator of the strength of national commitments to addressing health impacts of climate change.

TI Oil, relative strength and civil war mediation
SO COOPERATION AND CONFLICT
AB Civil conflicts within oil-rich states tend to last longer but are less likely to be mediated and end in a peace agreement. This implies that oil-funded conflict is less likely to end through a mediated settlement, despite offering a greater opportunity for peaceful resolution. This article builds on this puzzle, focusing on the following research question: to what extent does the presence of non-lootable natural resources impact on the onset and outcome of civil war mediation? I argue that oil wealth raises the relative capacity of the incumbent, making it more challenging for insurgents to force mediation and gain the guarantees against defection that are needed to resolve the problem of credible commitment. This theory is tested on 319 civil conflict episodes between 1946 and 2004. The results support the argument that non-lootable natural resources exert a strong negative effect on both the onset and outcome of mediation. The analysis also reveals that the negative effect of petroleum wealth increases relative to a state's hydrocarbon revenue (per capita). This is an important contribution to conflict research focused on natural resources that has previously overlooked the relationship between resource wealth and civil conflict management efforts.

TI Taming the Gods: How Religious Conflict Shapes State Repression
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Despite a robust literature on general forms of state repression, the determinants of religious repression remain unclear. This article argues that a regime's experience with religious conflict will lead it to be more repressive of religious groups within its territory for three primary reasons. Religious conflict increases the behavioral threat posed by religious groups, lowers the cost of repressing these communities, and evokes vivid memories of past religious violence that underscore the role of the state in taming religion to maintain social order. New, cross-national data on religious conflict and repression from 1990 to 2009 show that religious conflict has a significant and positive effect on the level of religious repression for the time period under investigation, expanding the types and severity of government restrictions on religion in a country. Our findings point to the importance of studying the causes and nature of negative sanctions against religious communities, specifically.

TI Movement of the people: Violence and internal displacement
SO INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW
AB Individuals internally displaced by conflict are a prominent feature of wars, political violence and other forms of repression. We suggest that a subnational analysis of internally displaced person (IDP) generation can help us determine the extent to which more specific flight-precipitating factors can account for individuals' behaviors. In particular, we are interested in how different conflict actors and the interactions of these actors affect the production of internally displaced persons. We suggest that some types of conflict actors are more likely to be responsible for greater numbers of internally displaced persons because of their political strategies. We focus on one of the most complex and yet data-rich environments in which the problem of internal displacement has been profound-Colombia. Using extensive data on internally displaced persons in Colombia among its over 1100 municipalities, we examine our expectations using negative binomial analyses to better understand the dynamics of conflict actors, the violence they perpetrate and internal displacement. We find that the identity of the conflict actor does make a difference in producing more internally displaced persons and that conflict between certain conflict actors is especially likely to produce more displaced persons.

TI Internally Displaced Populations and Suicide Terrorism
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This study asserts that countries with large internally displaced populations (IDPs) are more likely to experience a higher rate of suicide terrorism. After demonstrating this, the study tests four intervening factors hypothesized to drive the relationship between IDPs and suicide attacks: IDPs are expected (1) to increase the pool of potential suicide recruits, thereby lowering the labor costs for suicide terrorist groups; (2) to increase local ethnic conflicts that foster a favorable environment for suicide terrorism; (3) to worsen the human rights conditions in countries, prompting aggrieved people to support suicide terrorist tactics; and (4) to raise the counterterrorism and policing costs of the state, enabling terrorists to plan and execute suicide attacks. Results from negative binomial regression and Tobit models show evidence for the IDPs-suicide terrorism connection. When recursive models are employed to evaluate the effects of four intervening variables, the results most consistently support human rights violations as a significant and substantive mediator between IDPs and suicide attacks.

TI Armed Conflict and the Displaced
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFUGEE LAW
AB Many of the world's refugees have fled their homeland due to armed conflict. Added to this is the number of persons internally displaced in conflict zones. Even lawful tactics of armed conflict can force people to leave their home, their family and possessions. Unlawful tactics of ethnic cleansing intentionally exacerbate population displacement. Whether internally or externally displaced, many of the effects are the same - loss of family, possessions and home. However, while the effects are similar, the legal position of the two is very different. Forced to flee their homeland, refugees are vulnerable, so much so that they have been made the subject of international protection regimes. Internally displaced persons, on the other hand, remain within the state and the governmental protections that that brings. Whilst the two may only be physically separated across a state border by a few metres, the legal positions are an ocean apart.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER WARFARE AND TERRORISM
AB International security cooperation is regarded as one of the key and successful mechanisms to fight terrorism and other cross-border criminal activities worldwide. This paper focuses on the benefits and challenges of the US and African countries' defence cooperation, using Ghana as a case study. This study used 21 people as participants. The subjects were selected based on their unique knowledge and expertise in the phenomenon under study. The researchers used interviews to solicit the views of the participants on the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) between Ghana and the US focusing on the benefits and challenges. In conclusion, the study disclosed that no country has a monopoly on what it takes to fight terrorism and other transnational organised crime alone. The major challenges identified include the breach of domestic law, limited mutual trust, and discriminately ethnic and misguided religious practices. The challenges were stated as indispensable for the sustainability of the DCA and the successful mitigation of terrorism and transnational organised crime in West Africa.

While the Dekemvriana is commonly portrayed in right-left terminology in the historiography, this article argues that part of the reason for the left's failure was their inability to manage the Macedonian ethnic component of the struggle, either within their armed forces or in their relationship with Yugoslavia. As such, this article integrates the early phases of the Greek Civil War into the broader literature on minorities in civil conflict, while simultaneously exposing some of the myths about Macedonian involvement that result from its contemporary political ramifications.

As a result, sexual minorities remain an invisible population in armed conflict out of a need for safety. Further study of sexual minorities in conflict zones confronts matters of human rights, war crimes, and the psychosocial effects of war. This article reviews the existing research on sexual minorities in conflict zones, examines the findings on human rights, war crimes, and the psychosocial effects of war and violence on sexual minority populations, and reviews the barriers to effectiveness faced by intervention programs developed specifically to aid post-conflict societies. The article concludes with a summary of findings within the literature and further considerations for research on aggression and violent behavior with sexual minority groups in conflict zones.

After an overview of the Pact, the article discusses the main provisions of the current draft of the Pact, such as the right to live in an ecologically sound environment, the codification of existing environmental principles and the introduction of new principles. The article examines the relationship between the Pact and existing multilateral environmental agreements and institutions and comes to the conclusion that the stated intention for the Pact to serve as a 'legal umbrella' for the existing multilateral environmental treaties raises both political as well as legal questions. Furthermore, the Pact possesses only limited potential to strengthen international environmental law. Nonetheless, the initiative has the potential to trigger reforms in international environmental law by putting the protection of the environment at the top of the global agenda.

TI Managing complexity: addressing the civil conflict component of
   international-civil militarized conflicts (I-CMCs)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThe purpuse of this study is to answer the following two questions. Do conflict management efforts mitigate the recurrence and severity of civil conflict? If so, how? Do some conflict management strategies fare better than others in these tasks? This study theorizes about the connection between the costliness of a conflict management strategy - with respect to both the disputants and third parties - and civil conflict outcomes. This theory produces two contradictory predictions: that more costly strategies either increase or decrease violence. This study not only adjudicates between these two possibilities but also incorporates the role of timing. The early use of more costly strategies, for example, may encourage disputants to reduce violence in civil conflicts. Design/methodology/approachTo evaluate the predications that the authors derive from their theoretical argument, the authors quantitatively analyze the effect of conflict management strategies' relative cost on various measures of civil conflict recurrence and severity. The authors first identify the set of international-civil militarized conflicts (I-CMCs) during the period 1946-2010. I-CMCs contain two dimensions - interstate and intrastate - making them the most complex and dangerous form of militarized conflict. To each I-CMC, the authors then link all third-party attempts to manage the I-CMC's civil conflict dimension. Finally, after developing quantitative indicators, a series of regression equations explore the relationships of primary interest. FindingsTwo main findings emerge. First, when third parties use a relatively more costly conflict management strategy to manage a civil conflict (e.g. a peace operation or military intervention, as opposed to mediation), the severity of the conflict increases, while conflict recurrence rates remain unchanged. Second, this study uncovers a trade-off. The early use of a relatively more costly management strategy lowers a civil conflict's severity in the short-term. It also, however, increases the likelihood - and speed with which - civil conflict recurs. The timing of certain conflict management strategies matters. Originality/valueScholars typically isolate conflict management strategies in number (i.e. consider efforts as independent of one another, even those within the same conflict) and kind (i.e. examine mediation but not peace operations). This study, in contrast, includes the following: the full menu of conflict management strategies available to third parties - negotiation, mediation, adjudication/arbitration, peace operations, sanctions and military intervention - over a lengthy time period (1946-2010); theorizes about the relative merits of these strategies; and considers the timing of certain conflict management efforts. In so doing, it highlights a policy trade-off and proposes promising areas for future research.

AB Despite its low income per capita, Sri Lanka has achieved remarkable success in human development, largely due to appropriate government policies on health and education. However, Sri Lanka's economic performance has been below its potential, and the unresolved civil conflict poses one of the greatest obstacles to its long terms growth prospects. This article examines some indirect costs of Sri Lanka's civil war. It argues that the conflict has resulted in lower domestic and foreign investments, disruptions in trade and commerce, and lower revenues from tourism. As a consequence, economic growth has suffered. With no end in sight to the civil war, these costs are likely to mount, with pernicious effects on future living standards.

   China
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Although the rapid development of urbanization improves the global economy, it causes environmental pollution enormously. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the impact of urban agglomeration on the environment. For this purpose, the Yangtze river urban agglomeration in the Jiangsu province of China is taken as the study area to explore the performance of environmental governance. The pressure-state-response model was used to build the evaluation framework. The principal component analysis was applied to assess the environmental governance performance. Moreover, the spatial differentiation of environmental governance performance was analyzed in combination with the Moran Index (MI). The results revealed that the environmental governance performance of the Yangtze river urban agglomeration from 2012 to 2016 has generally improved, and the gap among cities remained significant. Moreover, the environmental governance performance of Nanjing and Zhenjiang remained at the top. Although Nantongs' comprehensive performance has significant progress in the past five years, it is still at a low level because the previous development methods caused enormous damages to the environment. There is the certain spatial aggregation of environmental governance performance among urban agglomeration. Results also found that the high-performance city was surrounded by a high level of environmental governance performance and vice versa. The results stress the enactment of improved environmental regulations to overcome the situation of environmental pollution. Particularly, strong coordination between environmental protection and resource exploitation is required regarding developing a policy framework.

TI Armed conflict and financial and economic risk: evidence from Colombia
SO RISK MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB This paper analyzes the impact of armed conflict on financial and economic risk in Colombia using data from 2002 to the end of 2012. We have examined the abnormal returns (AR) in the stock market in response to large-scale terrorist attacks. Our results suggest that the AR in stock market do respond to the attacks; our estimation findings show that these attacks increase the volatility of these AR. The increase in volatility is, however, rather small and short-lived. In addition to the financial risk, we have analyzed the impact of armed conflict on economic risk using the movements in industrial production. We showed the negative impact of armed conflict on the real sector with a five-month lag. We have also performed robustness checks one of which examined the attacks perpetuated only in the capital of Colombia, Bogota. The results suggest that investors do respond to a small subset of attacks executed in the capital city. We discuss the implications of the findings for risk management.

TI Diverging forest land use dynamics induced by armed conflict across the
   tropics
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Armed conflicts trigger region-specific mechanisms that affect land use change. Deforestation is presented as one of the most common negative environmental impacts resulting from armed conflicts, with relevant consequences in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and loss of ecosystem services. However, the impact of armed conflict on forests is complex and may simultaneously lead to positive and negative environmental outcomes, i.e. forest regrowth and deforestation, in different regions even within a country. We investigate the impact that armed conflict exerted over forest dynamics at different spatial scales in Colombia and for the global tropics during the period 1992-2015. Through the analysis of its internally displaced population (departures) our results suggest that, albeit finding forest regrowth in some municipalities, the Colombian conflict predominantly exerted a negative impact on its forests. A further examination of georeferenced fighting locations in Colombia and across the globe shows that conflict areas were 8 and 4 times more likely to undergo deforestation, respectively, in the following years in relation to average deforestation rates. This study represents a municipality level, long-term spatial analysis of the diverging effects the Colombian conflict exerted over its forest dynamics over two distinct periods of increasing and decreasing conflict intensity. Moreover, it presents the first quantified estimate of conflict's negative impact on forest ecosystems across the globe. The relationship between armed conflict and land use change is of global relevance given the recent increase of armed conflicts across the world and the importance of a possible exacerbation of armed conflicts and migration as climate change impacts increase.

TI Armed conflict, alcohol misuse, decision-making, and intimate partner
   violence among women in Northeastern Uganda: a population level study
SO CONFLICT AND HEALTH
AB Background: Relations among and interactions between exposure to armed conflict, alcohol misuse, low socioeconomic status, gender (in)equitable decision-making, and intimate partner violence (IPV) represent serious global health concerns. Our objective was to determine extent of exposure to these variables and test pathways between these indicators of interest.
   Methods: We surveyed 605 women aged 13 to 49 who were randomly selected via multistage sampling across three districts in Northeastern Uganda in 2016. We used Mplus 7.4 to estimate a moderated structural equation model of indirect pathways between armed conflict and intimate partner violence for currently partnered women (n = 558) to evaluate the strength of the relationships between the latent factors and determine the goodness-of-fit of the proposed model with the population data.
   Results: Most respondents (88.8%) experienced conflict-related violence. The lifetime/ past 12 month prevalence of experiencing intimate partner violence was 65.3%/ 50.9% (psychological) and 59.9%/ 43.8% (physical). One-third (30.7%) of women's partners reportedly consumed alcohol daily. The relative fit of the structural model was superior (CFI = 0.989; TLI = 0.989). The absolute fit (RMSEA = 0.029) closely matched the population data. The partner and joint decision-making groups significantly differed on the indirect effect through partner alcohol use (a(1)b(1) = 0.209 [0.017: 0.467]).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that male partner alcohol misuse is associated with exposure to armed conflict and intimate partner violence-a relationship moderated by healthcare decision-making. These findings encourage the extension of integrated alcohol misuse and intimate partner violence policy and emergency humanitarian programming to include exposure to armed conflict and gendered decision-making practices.

TI The post-war public health effects of civil conflict
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Civilian suffering from civil war extends well beyond the period of active warfare. We examine longer-term effects in a cross-national analysis of World Health Organization data on death and disability broken down by age, gender, and type of disease or condition. We find substantial long-term effects, even after controlling for several other factors. We estimate that the additional burden of death and disability incurred in 1999 alone, from the indirect and lingering effects of civil wars in the years 1991-1997, was nearly double the number incurred directly and immediately from all wars in 1999. This impact works its way through specific diseases and conditions, and disproportionately affects women and children. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Elections and Ethnic Civil War
SO COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Existing research on how democratization may influence the risk of civil war tends to consider only changes in the overall level of democracy and rarely examines explicitly the postulated mechanisms relating democratization to incentives for violence. The authors argue that typically highlighted key mechanisms imply that elections should be especially likely to affect ethnic groups' inclination to resort to violence. Distinguishing between types of conflict and the order of competitive elections, the authors find that ethnic civil wars are more likely to erupt after competitive elections, especially after first and second elections following periods of no polling. When disaggregating to the level of individual ethnic groups and conflicts over territory or government, the authors find some support for the notion that ethno-nationalist mobilization and sore-loser effects provoke postelectoral violence. More specifically, although large groups in general are more likely to engage in governmental conflicts, they are especially likely to do so after noncompetitive elections. Competitive elections, however, strongly reduce the risk of conflict.

TI Does the IMF cause civil war? A comment
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB The global economic downturn has heightened concerns about intervention by global financial institutions and political stability. One prominently-published article purports to show that signing on to an IMF structural adjustment program (SAP) increases the risk of civil war, Hartzell et al. (International Organization 64:339-56, 2010). The authors claim that IMF SAPs push liberalization, which hurts people badly enough that they foment civil war. We advance the debate by critically examining their theoretical and empirical evidence, particularly questioning their crucial assumptions about the impact of IMF programs on the economic environment in terms of who actually wins and loses from liberalization and who might be in a position to rebel. Using their data, we find that signing on to an IMF program predicts the onset of a civil war negatively if one uses a lower threshold of 25 deaths when defining civil war. These results suggest that the operationalization of the IMF variable as well as the use of large-scale civil war (1,000 deaths and above) simply capture the effect of ongoing conflict rather than the effects of liberalization. After extending the time period under study and making only minor changes to operationalization, we find that at no time does IMF involvement successfully predict the onset of a civil war.

TI Peace and prosperity or democratic chaos? Study of regime transitions
   and Civil War 1945-92
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB Recent political changes throughout the world seem to be followed by extensive political violence and ethnic conflict. Current examples are found in the former Soviet republics and in several countries in Africa. This article argues that in countries where political transitions take place, there is an introductory phase of uncertainty where violent confrontations between groups in the society are highly probable. Mansfield & Snyder have found a link between democratization and international war; I argue for a similar link to domestic violence. This article examines the global relationship between regime transitions and domestic armed conflict for the 1945-92 time period. Additional factors such as a country's level of socio-economic development and degree of ethnic fragmentation are also expected to have an impact on the political violence. The findings indicate that following major political changes countries become more prone to civil war and that the combination of a low level of socio-economic development and ethnic fragmentation further increases the danger of civil war.

TI State repression and human rights in postwar societies
SO REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS
AB This study analyzes the causes of state repression during post-civil war periods. For this purpose, it applies a multifactorial approach, considering armed conflict characteristics as well as the configuration of post-conflict societies as explanatory factors with regard to human rights violations committed by the State. From an empirical viewpoint, the work is based on a comprehensive database which includes all post-war periods registered between 1976 and 2012 and a total of 70 episodes that occurred in 56 different countries. The analysis shows the relevance of multiple variables, including the virulence of armed conflict, its ethnic dimension, the ruling postwar political regime, the presence of political opposition and population size, for explaining the status of human rights in post-conflict situations. The research also proposes a new viewpoint on the impact of state weakness on post-war repression. Thus, it suggests alternative lines of analysis and raises the need to explore the implementation of state-building policies as an additional tool to guarantee human rights in post-war scenarios.

TI Dynamics and Logics of Civil War
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This article reviews the literature on civil war. We focus on the most recent period of scholarly activity, beginning in the early 2000s when the publication of prominent quantitative studies triggered a surge in the empirical research of civil war as a well-defined conceptual category. We identify three explanatory logics that have dominated much of this literature and that view civil wars as a consequence of greed, grievances, and opportunities, respectively. We evaluate the arguments and findings of these theoretical approaches with respect to each of the main phases of war: outbreak, wartime dynamics, conflict termination, and postwar recovery. The article concludes by identifying key challenges confronting future civil war research. In particular, we emphasize the continuing need to advance theories that bridge the main explanatory logics as well as the different phases of conflict. Researchers should also pay more attention to defining the appropriate spatio-temporal scope of their studies.

TI SHADES OF GREEN: ENVIRONMENTALISM IN CLASSICAL POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
AB Over the past few decades, environmentalism has been gaining increased popularity and it seems now that almost the whole world has gone green. However, is it really so? Political ideology has been and remains one of the key factors influencing the policy-making process and environmental governance, be it global, regional or national. There have been many attempts to integrate green thought into classical ideologies, such as liberalism, conservatism, socialism, which have not been equally successful due to differences in the core concepts of named social philosophies. Whatever the case, the extent to which environmentalism will prove to be potent at "greening" existing political ideologies is likely to influence the future of global environmental governance. This article aims at discovering the different "shades of green" that have emerged to date through this process.

AB The article aims to investigate the role played by the United Nations (UN) in conflict resolution in the Central African Republic (CAR). Specifically, we will seek to answer the following question: how has the stabilization character of MINUSCA contributed to the peace process in the CAR? Our hypothesis is that the stabilization character of the operation and the robust use of force have contributed to the success of the peace process in terms of containing conflict, but not exactly in the sense of promoting its resolution and the establishment of long-term peace since the mission has not focused on addressing the deeper causes of the conflict. Methodologically, the article will be based on the analysis of the mission mandate and reports on its performance, as well as data on budget, financial contributions, and personnel. Also, it will explore a set of data on the incidence of armed conflict and violent episodes involving civilians from 2014 to 2020.

TI Oil and terrorism: an investigation of mediators
SO PUBLIC CHOICE
AB Do states with oil wealth experience more terrorism and, if so, why? Drawing from the intrastate war literature, this study considers several factors that prospectively mediate the relationship between oil wealth and terrorism: state weakness; rentier state authoritarianism; corruption of government officials; income inequality; human rights violations; foreign military intervention; and heightened separatist activity. Based on structural equation modeling on a sample of 130 non-OECD countries for the period 1970-2012, the paper produces two main empirical findings. First, while onshore oil production increases terrorist attacks in countries, on- and offshore production and oil revenues from exports do not increase such attacks. Second, the impact of oil on terrorism is mediated through increased human rights abuses. Exploitation of oil is found to be associated with a worsening of physical integrity rights abuses that, in turn, lead to popular grievances that help to fuel terrorist campaigns.

AB Terrorism has often been associated with armed conflict. The so-called Islamic State is the most prominent example of a group that rose to power amidst armed conflict. Against this backdrop, it sounds rather strange to associate terrorism with peace. Terrorism, however, has also been called, "the peacetime equivalent of war crimes". This raises the question how the concepts of terrorism, peace, armed conflict and war crimes relate. This article defines these concepts and applies them in the context of International Humanitarian Law, which is also known as the law of armed conflict. It also discusses today's fight against is in light of the November 2015 Paris Attacks, thereby questioning the consequences and desirability of a war paradigm.

TI Introducing the UCDP Non-State Conflict Dataset
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB This article extends the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) by presenting new global data on non-state conflict, or armed conflict between two groups, neither of which is the state. The dataset includes conflicts between rebel groups and other organized militias, and thus serves as a complement to existing datasets on armed conflict which have either ignored this kind of violence or aggregated it into civil war. The dataset also includes cases of fighting between supporters of different political parties as well as cases of communal conflict, that is, conflict between two social groups, usually identified along ethnic or religious lines. This thus extends UCDP's conflict data collection to facilitate the study of topics like rebel fractionalization, paramilitary involvement in conflict violence, and communal or ethnic conflict. In the article, we present a background to the data collection and provide descriptive statistics for the period 1989-2008 and then illustrate how the data can be used with the case of Somalia. These data move beyond state-centric conceptions of collective violence to facilitate research into the causes and consequences of group violence which occurs without state participation.

TI Organizational Commitment in Time of War: Assessing the Impact and
   Attenuation of Employee Sensitivity to Ethnopolitical Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT
AB We examine organizational commitment in foreign-invested and indigenous firms located in an operating environment characterized by ethnopolitical conflict and its violent manifestations of civil war and terrorism. Drawing on the management, psychology, and political science literature streams, we investigate whether employee sensitivity to ethnopolitical conflict contributes to explaining organizational commitment in a violent operating environment. The results of hierarchical regression analysis reveal that employee sensitivity to ethnopolitical conflict is inversely related to organizational commitment and has explanatory power beyond the traditional predictors of organizational commitment. Further, perceived organizational support is found to attenuate the negative relationship between employee sensitivity to ethnopolitical conflict and organizational commitment in foreign-invested firms but not in indigenous firms. The data suggest that an operating environment beset with violent ethnopolitical conflict may exact an indirect cost on the firm through lowered employee commitment, and that foreign-invested firms through a 'foreignness advantage' can manage this potential cost by maintaining a high level of perceived organizational support among their employees. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI People vs. Malthus: Population pressure, environmental degradation, and
   armed conflict revisited
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Demographic and environmental factors have claimed a dominant position in the post-Cold War security discourse. According to the neo-Malthusian conflict scenario, population pressure on natural renewable resources makes societies more prone to low-intensity civil war. On the contrary resource-optimists concede that agricultural land scarcity caused by high population density may be a driving factor behind economic development, thus causing peace in a long-term perspective. These notions are tested in a quantitative cross-national time-series study covering the 1950-2000 period. The results do not provide strong support for either perspective. Countries experiencing high rates of population growth, high rates of urbanization, or large refugee populations do not face greater risks of internal armed conflict. There is some indication that scarcity of potential cropland may have a pacifying effect. However, where land scarcity combines with high rates of population growth, the risk of armed conflict increases somewhat. This trend is particularly marked for the 1970s, the decade that saw the great rise in neo-Malthusian concerns. Claims that the world has entered a 'new age of insecurity after the end of the Cold War, where demographic and environmental factors threaten security and state stability, appear to be unfounded. Overall, the robustness of the empirical support for both paradigms is low. A strong emphasis on security as a macro rationale for reducing global population growth thus seems unwarranted.

AB We examine the causal impact of the 2002-2007 civil conflict in Cote d'Ivoire on children's health using household surveys collected before, during, and after the conflict, and information on the exact location and date of conflict events. Our identification strategy relies on exploiting both temporal and spatial variation across birth cohorts to measure children's exposure to the conflict. We find that children from regions more affected by the conflict suffered significant health setbacks compared with children from less affected regions. We further examine possible war impact mechanisms using rich survey data on households' experience of war. Our results suggest that conflict-related household victimization, and in particular economic losses, is an important channel through which armed conflict negatively impacts child health.

SO SOCIAL & LEGAL STUDIES
AB This article examines internally displaced women's narratives of rebuilding their life after displacement, focusing on questions of moral agency and community governance. The data come from a 3-year research project (2010-2013) with internally displaced women in Colombia, during the emergence of a new transitional justice regime. The article finds in internally displaced women's narratives of the injuries of war, of their own resistance and overcoming, and of their aspirations for the future, concerns that go beyond poverty alleviation and redistribution in peace-building efforts. Internally displaced women's narratives also engage with questions of ordinary ethics and community governance, describing the loss of moral agency in civil war and its painstaking recovery. This article questions the limitations of transitional justice regimes and peace-building efforts that ignore concerns with the loss of moral agency and community during civil war as well as the role of ordinary ethics in peace building at the grassroots.

In discussing the current phase since the Paris Agreement, we offer to the emerging literature on international neoliberal environmental governance an analytical framework by which the extent of international neoliberal governance can be assessed. We conceptualize international neoliberal environmentalism as characterized by four main processes: the prominence of libertarian ideals of justice, in which justice is defined as the rational pursuit of sovereign self-interest between unequal parties; marketization, in which market mechanisms, private sector engagement and purportedly 'objective' considerations are viewed as the most effective and efficient forms of governance; governance by disclosure, in which the primary obstacles to sustainability are understood as 'imperfect information' and onerous regulatory structures that inhibit innovation; and exclusivity, in which multilateral decision-making is shifted from consensus to minilateralism. Against this framework, we argue that the contemporary UNFCCC regime has institutionalized neoliberal reforms in climate governance, although not without resistance, in a configuration which is starkly different than that of earlier eras. We conclude by describing four crucial gaps left by this transition, which include the ability of the regime to drive adequate ambition, and gaps in transparency, equity and representation.

TI Re-conceptualizing the Science of Sustainability: A Dynamical Systems
   Approach to Understanding the Nexus of Conflict, Development and the
   Environment
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The concept of sustainability has come to permeate many spheres of governance, decision-making and scientific inquiry. Although current academic conceptualizations of sustainability often acknowledge the conflicts inherent in the pursuit of sustainable development, the present discourse does not explicitly include the concepts of peace and conflict. This omission has been in error, as the pursuits of sustainable environmental governance and sustainable human development are themselves efforts to manage and resolve conflict. Thus, this article advocates for an expanded framework of sustainability that operates at the nexus of conflict, environment and development by exploring current mainstream conceptualizations of sustainability and illustrating the direct connections between sustainability and the fields of peace studies and conflict resolution. It goes on to discuss the utility of applying a complex systems approach to the expanded conceptualization of sustainability, including aspects of both coupled systems and dynamical systems theory, in order to provide an analytical framework for studying mechanisms that enable sustainable development by dealing explicitly with conflicting needs and interests among actors in social-ecological systems.

SO HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH
AB Despite an increase in efforts to address shortage and performance of Human Resources for Health (HRH), HRH problems continue to hamper quality service delivery. We believe that the influence of governance is undervalued in addressing the HRH crisis, both globally and at country level. This thematic series has aimed to expand the evidence base on the role of governance in addressing the HRH crisis. The six articles comprising the series present a range of experiences. The articles report on governance in relation to developing a joint vision, building adherence and strengthening accountability, and on governance with respect to planning, implementation, and monitoring. Other governance issues warrant attention as well, such as corruption and transparency in decision-making in HRH policies and strategies. Acknowledging and dealing with governance should be part and parcel of HRH planning and implementation. To date, few experiences have been shared on improving governance for HRH policy making and implementation, and many questions remain unanswered. There is an urgent need to document experiences and for mutual learning.

TI Environmental governance, local government competition and industrial
   green transformation: Evidence from China's sustainable development
   practice
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The rapid development of China's economy has also led to serious environmental problems, which have seriously restricted China's sustainable development. To this end, the Chinese government has continued to explore environmental governance. So, can environmental governance policies promote industrial green transformation, so as to achieve the goal of sustainable development? Will environmental policy competition among local governments have an impact on them? These issues are the focus of this article. Based on the provincial panel data of China from 2006 to 2021, this article empirically analyzes the relationship between environmental governance, local government competition, and industrial green transformation. The results found that there was a "U " type nonlinear relationship between environmental governance and industrial green transformation. On the whole, most regions of China are still in the development stage where environmental governance is not conducive to industrial green transformation. There is competition for environmental governance policies among local governments in China, and the characteristics of "race to the bottom " are more significant. In the East developed areas, there is a more significant "yardstick competition " game state. In the Midwest undeveloped areas, it is manifested as competition for resources by deregulation of the environment, thereby promoting short-term economic growth. In addition, local protection behaviors negatively regulate the impact of environmental governance on industrial green transformation, that is, inhibiting local industrial green transformation by causing labor market mismatch. This study can provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to adopt measures to achieve the sustainable development of the economy and environment.

AB Our understandings of the effects of war on land and resource access following armed conflicts are often shaped (and limited) by a reliance upon remotely sensed data. Here, we analyze household-level survey and community-level focus group data collected in Sri Lanka following the end of the nation's ethno-religiously rooted civil war (1983-2009) to determine if and how the war differently affected the nation's rice farmers. Our synthetic analyses revealed geographic variation in agricultural livelihood viability in post-war Sri Lanka, demonstrating how the protracted effects of war are exacerbating the vulnerability of rural Sri Lanka's ethno-religious minority (Tamil and Moor) populations by (re-)shaping access to critical natural resources, including both land and irrigation water.

TI Economic Grievance and the Severity of Civil War
SO CIVIL WARS
AB This article examines the relationship between economic grievance and the severity of civil war. Theoretically, we create a testable micro-foundation for the association between economic grievance and conflict intensity. We argue that grievance does not lessen after the onset of civil war. Rather, pent-up grievance aggravates violence during the war. The more relative deprivation there is prior to the conflict, the more deadly and violently participants are expected to behave on the battlefield. This proposition is tested in a statistical analysis using the Armed Conflict Dataset (1960-92). Empirically, we demonstrate that economic grievance makes civil war more deadly. This effect is independent of the effect of ethnic grievance.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB There is a conceptual gap between causes-of-war research and conflict resolution research. This article introduces a macro-level conceptual framework to facilitate analysis of the outbreak, conduct and resolution of armed conflict within states. Three arguments are advanced, linked to the three questions Why do people start fighting?, Why do people stop fighting? and How can peace be made durable? The first argument is that people take to arms because they have Reasons in the form of grievances and goals, Resources in the form of capabilities and opportunities, and Resolve because they see no alternative to violence in order to address grievances and attain goals. Second, the Triple-R concepts also explain the 'outbreak of peace', that is, war termination and peace-building. Third, variations in the dependent variable-different degrees of peace; here termed Triple-M (Mutually Hurting Stalemate, Mutually Enticing Opportunities and Mutually Obtained Rewards)-are explained by changes within those three clusters of explanatory factors.

SO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC
AB In the field of global environmental governance South Korea stands out. Since 2005 it has been the initiator and central node in a majority of international networks and organizations promoting green growth. Based on new theoretical approaches and empirical analysis, this article highlights the significance of Korea's middle power diplomacy in relation to green growth governance, establishing it as a 'GreenMiddle Power.' Middle power analyses of Korea usually portray it as a regionally constrained and secondary actor in global governance. This article supplements middle power theory's behavioral approach with a strategic action approach inspired by Bourdieu's practice theory, which it applies to an original database of >1,000 sources, 18 interviews, and 10 participatory observations. The article argues that Korea has become a primary actor in global environmental governance by demonstrating how Korea has established a sub-field of green growth governance through a wide range of strategic moves.

It does so by focusing on four newspapers that are representative of different ideological stances and economic relations with the Turkish government. The time period is during two key events: the Kobani protests in 2014 and the elections in 2015. The research findings indicate that the media's framing of the armed conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK is a contested discursive site; one determined not only by ideological affiliation but also by the relative politico-economic autonomy of the media institutions from the central political power.

TI Does civil war hamper financial development?
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB We examine how armed conflict effects financial development in a cross-country setting using dynamic panel data analysis in a panel of 66 developing countries for the period 1985-2010. Financial development is measured by M2 as a share of GDP, and credit allocated to private sector by banks as a share of GDP. Our findings suggest that armed conflict has a significant adverse effect on financial development. Simultaneously, the quality of governance is always highly significant and conducive to the financial development. The quality of governance is more salient in determining financial development compared to low- and medium-intensity armed conflict; however, the quality of governance cannot entirely offset the adverse impact of high-intensity armed conflict on financial development.

   war onset
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This study leverages a statistical model to answer an empirical puzzle: given that popular conventional wisdom and many theories of ethnic conflict suggest that the ethnic composition of a society should influence the probability that a country experiences civil war, why are the results of large-n studies so contradictory? The author argues that confusion over the nature of the relationship between ethnic cleavages and the likelihood of civil war onset stems from a disconnect between ethnic conflict theory and empirical testing. Most studies that test for a relationship between the level of ethnic fractionalization and civil war onset test only for a direct relationship, while theories of ethnic conflict have suggested that ethnic diversity should have an indirect effect of the likelihood of civil war onset. The author uses a heteroskedastic probit model to show that ethnic fractionalization has an indirect effect on the likelihood of civil war onset.

Violence and any act of terrorism emerging from the armed conflict increase vulnerability, the silencing of memory, impunity and to a large extent, promotes an evasive logic of responsibilities and reparations that are necessary to clarify the victimizing facts and give voice to those affected. The armed conflict brings victims together in a dynamic of terror that impacts all their areas of development and limits their sense of security, trust and credibility in each other and in social institutions.

TI Polycentric Environmental Governance to Achieving SDG 16: Evidence from
   Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa
SO FORESTS
AB Effective environmental governance is deemed essential in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. However, environmental dimensions have no specific reference across the SDG 16 targets and indicators. In achieving SDG 16-the realization of peace, justice, and strong institution, polycentric environmental governance involving multiple actors across scales deserves thoughtful consideration. This study illustrates the potential of a polycentric approach to environmental governance in achieving SDG 16, using case studies of forest, watershed, and transboundary bushland and seascape management in Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa, namely Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Kenya-Somalia cross-border. By highlighting four key elements of polycentric governance namely, political will, legal framework, support from higher-level governance and capacity building, the case studies demonstrate that polycentric governance play a significant role in achieving three environment-relevant SDG 16 targets, yet these targets are silent about environmental governance dimensions. Since many conflicts arise from the environment and natural resources sector, we suggest that (i) polycentric environmental governance be strongly pursued to achieve SDG 16, and (ii) SDG 16 includes indicators specifically directed on polycentric environment and natural resource governance.

TI The prosecution of organised crime: removing the jury
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE & PROOF
AB Serious organised crime groups may enjoy virtual impunity through the corruption and coercion of parties involved in the criminal justice process. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, this is most evident in the intimidation of witnesses and jurors, leading to difficulties in successful prosecution of organised criminality. One notable response to this phenomenon is to hold juryless trials for serious indictable offences, mirroring a similar approach in counter-terrorism legislation arising from the political violence in Northern Ireland. Despite common rationales, such trials have been operationalised differently in these neighbouring jurisdictions: in England, Wales and Northern Ireland 'ordinary' legislation was introduced, whereas in Ireland juryless trials are permitted under existing counter-terrorism laws. This article reviews the problematic dimensions of both legislative schemes, and considers their application by the courts since enactment. After outlining viable alternatives, it concludes that juryless trials may be necessary in limited instances, and if so, the English model is to be preferred.

TI Narcotics and armed conflict: Interaction and implications
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
AB The link between armed conflict and the production and trafficking of illicit drugs has been much noted in the popular literature, and recent research tentatively indicates a link between lootable resources, including narcotics, and conflict duration. Yet the specific dynamics of the linkage between narcotics and conflict remain poorly understood. Evolving theory on the link between organized crime and terrorism enhances and supplements the debate on economic incentives in civil war, proposing mechanisms whereby insurgent groups interact with narcotics production-a crime-rebellion nexus. Studies of nine major narcotics-producing areas indicates strong support for this nexus. Rather than generating or being generated by drug cultivation, armed conflict qualitatively and quantitatively transforms existing drug cultivation. Importantly, armed conflict is itself deeply affected by the narcotics industry, which tends to strengthen the capacity of insurgent movements while weakening that of the state. A momentous aspect of the crime-rebellion nexus is the effect that the drug industry tends to have on the motivational structures of insurgent groups: criminal involvement in some instances creates an economic function of war and vested interests in the continuation of armed conflict. This has substantial implications for strategies to resolve armed conflict involving the production and trafficking of illicit drugs.

TI TRADEMARKS AND PRIVATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE
SO NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW
AB This Article examines the relationship between private environmental governance and trademark law. Over the past two decades, green trademarks and other forms of private governance have flourished in tandem with the retreat from national and international public law modalities of environmental regulation. The rising political opposition to environmental regulation partly accounts for this change. Also relevant is the rise of globalization, which due to jurisdictional and trade constraints has diminished the effective regulatory control countries have over products sold in their markets.
   Private environmental governance is premised on consumers "voting with their wallets" by selecting products that reflect not just their instrumental preferences, but also their values. The potential of this form of private governance has not been realized, however, in part because consumers are often overwhelmed by information from multiple green trademarks with different standards or criteria. The resulting congestion of market information has undermined the communicative function of green trademarks that is essential to enabling consumers to make environmentally responsible choices.
   For a variety of reasons, trademark law is premised on a narrowly prescribed role for trademarks that is poorly adapted to facilitating information-based forms of private governance. Instead, intramural battles over the scope of trademark rights-ignited by overreaching corporate branding strategies-have elevated a reactionary turn in trademark theory that reduces trademarks solely to identifying the specific source of a product or service. We argue that the normative ends of private environmental governance should factor into, though by no means determine, trademark policy.

The prominent criminal insurgency approach helpfully focuses attention on cartel-state conflict, but unnecessarily redefines insurgency as state-weakening, eliding critical differences in rebels' and cartels' aims. Whereas rebels fight states, and cartels fight with one another, to conquer mutually prized territory and resources, cartels fight states merely to constrain their behavior and influence policy outcomes. This distinction yields a typology with theoretical consequences: decisive victory plays an important role in most models of civil war but is impossible or undesirable in wars of constraint. Theories of criminal war must therefore explain how ongoing coercive violence can be preferable to pacific strategies. I distinguish two such coercive logics of cartel-state conflict: violent lobbying and violent corruption. Lobbyings' more universalistic benefits elicit free riding, so turf war among cartels should make it rarer than violent corruption. This prediction accords with qualitative and quantitative evidence from Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil.

   Ukraine
SO CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK AND HEALTH INTERVENTION
AB Background. In 2014, an armed conflict began in the eastern territories of Ukraine. In Kharkiv region, there are one of the highest numbers of internal migrants in need of social assistance in Ukraine.
   Objective is to define effective strategies of social service provision to internal migrants (or internally displaced persons in Kharkiv region.
   Methods. General scientific methods and special scientific methods (content analysis method and others) are applied. The analysis of the secondary sociological information array concerning the problems of social protection of internally displaced persons in Ukraine and Kharkiv region.
   Results. It is argued that the social assistance project "Helping Hand" has become the most successful in the social field for IDPs.
   Conclusions. The most successful projects on providing social assistance to internal migrants in Kharkiv are highlighted: in employment and housing spheres. The focus on organizational issues in obtaining social services for internal migrants is made.

TI Interethnic Tensions in Kyrgyzstan: A Political Geographic Perspective
SO EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS
AB Two U. S. geographers review an array of intertwining political geographic issues that provide context and set the stage for deadly armed conflict between groups of ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in the southern Kyrgyzstan city of Osh in June 2010. Applying a disaggregated and localized approach to understanding the ambiguous and complex factors underlying the current instability in Kyrgyzstan, they focus on: the role of north-south political competition; the country's uneasy economic relationship with its western neighbor, Uzbekistan; widespread official corruption and the penetration of organized crime into government structures; as well as broader geopolitical issues. The latter include Tashkent's policy toward the Uzbek diaspora, perceived threats from international terrorism/Islamist fundamentalism, the potential for the export of a "color revolution" to Uzbekistan, the presence of U. S. and Russian military forces in Central Asia, and the relative ineffectiveness of regional security structures such as the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

TI The Political Impact of Displacement: Wartime IDPs, Religiosity, and
   Post-War Politics in Bosnia
SO POLITICS AND RELIGION
AB Following armed conflict, why do some members of ethno-religious groups vote for political parties that use religious appeals while others do not? I argue that internal displacement shapes the relationship between conflict and post-war political outcomes. Specifically, individuals who become internally displaced during armed conflict will use their religious faith to cope with the trauma of displacement, thereby strengthening their religiosity. This heightened religiosity then leads them to prefer religiously oriented parties after conflict. Analyzing survey data from Bosnian Muslims, I show that internally displaced respondents were more likely to vote for the religious nationalist Party of Democratic Action nearly a decade after conflict. Employing matching analysis, I then verify that these internally displaced persons became more religious than other respondents compared to before the war. My findings therefore provide evidence that trauma and religiosity combine to shape post-war voting behavior for members of ethno-religious groups.

TI Psychiatric Disorders in Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons After
   Forced Displacement: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Protracted armed conflicts not only shape political, legal, and socio-economic structures, but also have a lasting impact on people's human migration. In 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported an unprecedented number of 65.6 million individuals who were displaced worldwide as a result of armed conflicts. To date, however, little is known about these people's mental health status. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among forcibly displaced populations in settings of armed conflicts.
   Methods: We undertook a database search using Medline, PsycINFO, PILOTS, and the Cochrane Library, using the following keywords and their appropriate synonyms to identify relevant articles for possible inclusion: "mental health," "refugees," "internally displaced people," "survey," and "war." This search was limited to original articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published after 1980. We reviewed studies with prevalence rates of common psychiatric disorders-mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse, and suicidality-among adult internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees afflicted by armed conflicts.
   Results: The search initially yielded 915 articles. Of these references 38 studies were eligible and provided data for a total of 39,518 adult IDPs and refugees from 21 countries. The highest prevalence were for reported for post-traumatic stress disorder (3-88%), depression (5-80%), and anxiety disorders (1-81%) with large variation. Only 12 original articles reported about other mental disorders.
   Conclusions: These results show a substantial lack of data concerning the wider extent of psychiatric disability among people living in protracted displacement situations. Ambitious assessment programs are needed to support the implementation of sustainable global mental health policies in war-torn countries. Finally, there is an urgent need for large-scale interventions that address psychiatric disorders in refugees and internally displaced persons after displacement.

TI The Collaborative Management of Sustained Unsustainability: On the
   Performance of Participatory Forms of Environmental Governance
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In modern democratic consumer societies, decentralized, participative, and consensus oriented forms of multi-stakeholder governance are supplementing, and often replacing, conventional forms of state-centered environmental government. The engagement in all phases of the policy process of diverse social actors has become a hallmark of environmental good governance. This does not mean to say, however, that these modes of policy-making have proved particularly successful in resolving the widely debated multiple sustainability crisis. In fact, they have been found wanting in terms of their ability to respond to democratic needs and their capacity to resolve environmental problems. So why have these participatory forms of environmental governance become so prominent? What exactly is their appeal? What do they deliver? Exploring these questions from the perspective of eco-political and sociological theory, this article suggests that these forms of environmental governance represent a performative kind of eco-politics that helps liberal consumer societies to manage their inability and unwillingness to achieve the socio-ecological transformation that scientists and environmental activists say is urgently required. This reading of the prevailing policy approaches as the collaborative management of sustained unsustainability adds an important dimension to the understanding of environmental governance and contemporary eco-politics more generally.

TI Contesting liberal peace: Russia's emerging model of conflict management
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Russia has started to present itself as a peacemaker despite advocating for interventions that prioritise authoritarianism over human rights and democracy - quite different from the current international norm of liberal peacebuilding. This article explains why Russia is creating its own model of conflict management, and what this says about Russia's challenge to the international order.
   Russia has begun to promote itself internationally as a mediator of conflict and as a 'peacemaker'. Russian officials cite its extensive experience in managing numerous post-Soviet conflicts and its more recent experience of intervention in civil wars in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia considers all these activities forms of 'peacemaking', but its approach differs radically from the model of liberal peacebuilding that has dominated international practice in the post-Cold War era. It prioritizes authoritarian stability over justice, human rights and democracy and advocates short-term goals of conflict management over long-term goals of conflict resolution. In this article I explain why Russia's norms of peacemaking and conflict management diverged so markedly from liberal peacebuilding norms. I argue that Russia is no longer simply contesting western norms, but developing its own distinct model of conflict management. This model accepts the use of force as an integral element in peacemaking, engages in 'coercive' mediation by authoritative actors, and views the West as a geopolitical and normative opponent. This debate over Russia's approach to peace and conflict also offers wider insights into how Russia challenges the norms and practices that underpin the liberal international order.

TI The right to health, public health and COVID-19: a discourse on the
   importance of the enforcement of humanitarian and human rights law in
   conflict settings for the future management of zoonotic pandemic
   diseases
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives: The catastrophic effects of armed conflict, particularly prolonged armed conflict, on individual and public health are well established. The 'right' to healthcare during armed conflict and its lack of enforcement despite a range of United Nations mandated requirements regarding health and healthcare provisions is likely to be a significant feature in future conflicts, as zoonotic-induced pandemics become a more common global public health challenge. The issue of enforcement of health rights assurance and its implications for the public health management of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in and between countries and regions in conflict is the objective of this Review.
   Study design: A narrative review was conducted.
   Methods: Referenced to the framework of International humanitarian law (IHL) and International human rights law (IHRL) to explore and discuss the deficits in health rights assurances in conflict settings and illustrate how gaps in protection and lack of enforcement compounds the disease response. Both IHL, and IHRL can be leveraged to ensure human and health rights are assured in conflict settings. There is a distinct lack of international criteria with regard to standards of healthcare coverage, infrastructure and service preservation to the civilian population during times of armed conflict. This has far reaching consequences when confounded by a pandemic or even localised disease outbreak.
   Results: We illustrate how in a pandemic disease emergency, such as COVID-19, all life is threatened; and how leaving the citizen population exposed to this contagion is a human rights breach and an indirect method of warfare. The consequences of failure to effectively address such pandemic infections, (i.e. COVID-19), in a conflict setting are potentially catastrophic as prevention and containment responses are severely constrained by state insecurity, political instability, terrorism, repression, rights abuses, and displacement of citizens. Neglect by State actors potentially constitutes a breach of the universal right to life. States cannot justify their failures to mitigate disease based on claims of lack of resources, even when available resources are minimal. Where discrimination of people with a disease, such as COVID-19, or minority groups at the point of access to health facilities occurs, this further breaches the principle of medical neutrality.
   Conclusions: The example of the COVID-19 response may offer a viable route to leverage greater access and coverage of healthcare in conflict and humanitarian settings. A radicalised partnership approach during these times of emergency is warranted, based on an ethical 'humanitarian intervention' approach to provide care to all affected by contagious disease in conflict settings.

   development goals: applying indicators for assessing performance
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess African performance for substantially reducing all forms of corruption and bribery on the continent by 2030, through the indicators for achieving Target 16.5 of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the available and accessible relevant data from credible sources, this work quantifies, outlines and analyses the relationship between corruption/bribery and sustainable development as it applies primarily to sub-Saharan Africa; assesses the trends in the region through the official indicators for achieving Target 16.5 of the SDGs; and recommends other indicators for assessing ethical behaviour in African political, administrative and business leadership and institutions for achieving sustainable development and improved ethical performance towards significant reductions in all manifestations of bribery and corruption on the continent by 2030. Findings Corruption and bribery are found to affect all SDG-related sectors, undermining development outcomes and severely compromising efforts to achieve the SDGs in Africa. Consequently, prioritising corruption reduction including from money laundering, bribery and other illegal activities is a necessary requirement for achieving sustainable development, good governance, building effective and inclusive institutions as required by SDG 16, and funding the achievement of the SDGs. Originality/value The main value of the paper is the insights it provides through the very comprehensive compilation of statistical information that quantifies, and with analysis, the corruption/bribery avenues and the resultant deleterious effects on sustainable development in Africa.

TI Evaluating environmental sustainability of an urban industrial plan
   under the three-line environmental governance policy in China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Rapid and large-scale industrial growth has imposed tremendous challenges to the sustainable development of cities in China. The evaluation of the environmental sustainability of industrial planning has become a top priority for improving urban sustainability. In this regard, a goal-oriented framework, called three-line environmental governance, was proposed in the latest Chinese environmental management policy. Three lines, consisting of an ecological conservation red line, an environmental quality bottom line and a resource utilization upper limit line are to be taken into account when evaluating the potential effects of an urban industrial development plan. In this paper, the fuzzy axiomatic design system was applied in the development of an evaluation process and an indicator system that can be used to evaluate industrial alternatives that are established based on the three lines requirement. In an application of this methodology, the Industrial Green Development Plan of the city of Ordos was taken as a case study to recommend an optimal alternative. The target accessibilities of five alternatives were evaluated by conducting a comprehensive comparison among the alternatives meeting the environmental sustainability objectives of all of the indicators. This research shows that the evaluation of environmental sustainability on the basis of the three-line environmental governance policy is an effective way of promoting industrial green development and integrating environmental management requirements into urban industrial planning. It proposes not only a universal process for evaluating the environmental sustainability of urban industrial alternatives, but also a feasible method of tracking and evaluating the performance of industrial green development.

TI Beyond ethnicity: historical states and modern conflict
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB Historical states, be they sprawling empires or nominal vassal states, can make lasting impressions on the territories they once governed. We argue that more historical states located within the borders of modern states increase the chance of civil conflict because they (1) created networks useful for insurgency, (2) were symbols of past sovereignty, (3) generated modern ethnic groups that activated dynamics of ethnic inclusion and exclusion, and (4) resisted western colonialism. Using new global data on historical statehood, we find a robust positive association between more historical states inside a modern state and the rate of civil conflict onset between 1946 and 2019. This relationship is not driven by common explanations of state formation that also drive conflict such as the number of ethnic groups, population density, colonialism, levels of historical warfare, or other region-specific factors. We also find that historical states are more likely to be conflict inducing when they are located far from the capital and in poorer countries. Our study points to unexplored channels linking past statehood to modern-day conflict that are independent of ethno-nationalist conflict and open possibilities for a new research agenda linking past statehood to modern-day conflict outcomes.

TI Orchestrating transnational environmental governance in maritime
   shipping
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Maritime shipping is the transmission belt of the global economy. It is also a major contributor to global environmental change through its under-regulated air, water and land impacts. It is puzzling that shipping is a lagging sector as it has a well-established global regulatory body the International Maritime Organization. Drawing on original empirical evidence and archival data, we introduce a four-factor framework to investigate two main questions: why is shipping lagging in its environmental governance; and what is the potential for the International Maritime Organization to orchestrate emerging private 'green shipping' initiatives to achieve better ecological outcomes? Contributing to transnational governance theory, we find that conditions stalling regulatory progress include low environmental issue visibility, poor interest alignment, a broadening scope of environmental issues, and growing regulatory fragmentation and uncertainty. The paper concludes with pragmatic recommendations for the International Maritime Organization to acknowledge the regulatory difficulties and seize the opportunity to orchestrate environmental progress.

TI Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Anxiety and Depression Symptoms, and
   Psychosocial Treatment Needs in Colombians Internally Displaced by Armed
   Conflict: A Mixed-Method Evaluation
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
AB Armed conflict in Colombia has resulted in the displacement of an estimated 4.5 million people, or about 10% of the Colombian population. Hundreds of thousands of Colombians are exposed to violence and forced displacement annually. The present study used survey methods to assess levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms in a convenience sample of 109 internally displaced adults residing in Medellin, Colombia. A qualitative approach including an open-ended survey and focus groups with a subsample of 44 survey respondents was used to gain a better understanding of mental health treatment needs. A large proportion of survey respondents exceeded cut-scores for clinically significant PTSD (88%), anxiety (59%), and depression (41%). Multivariate regression models showed that female gender was a significant predictor of higher PTSD symptom levels and that female gender, higher education, and being separated as opposed to married predicted higher levels of depression symptoms. Focus group findings suggest that participants are interested in specialized psychological treatments as well as broader psychosocial interventions to treat the consequences of exposure to violence and forced displacement.

TI The roots to peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo: conservation as
   a platform for green development
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is endowed with an abundance of natural resources, and the presence of high-value resources such as coltan and diamonds is well known. The country is also endowed with a wealth of biodiversity, although the value of this is often overlooked. This article describes the detrimental impact of armed conflict on this biodiversity and the dangers posed by the return of peace, which is likely to result in increased biodiversity exploitation. The resulting loss of key carbon sinks crucial to the global fight against climate change will affect not only the DRC, but also the international community. Biodiversity is therefore identified as a threat to security but also a valuable asset for development, and this article discusses methods to realize the value of biodiversity in the DRC through the benefits of ecosystem services and income generated from monetizing biodiversity. It concludes by arguing that the false dichotomy of conservation and development as separate entities and objectives needs to change so that conservation becomes a central pillar of security and development work in the DRC and other regions of current or recent armed conflict around the world.

TI Displacement in urban areas: new challenges, new partnerships
SO DISASTERS
AB Rapid urbanisation is a key characteristic of the modern world, interacting with and reinforcing other global mega trends, including armed conflict, climate change, crime, environmental degradation, financial and economic instability, food shortages, underemployment, volatile commodity prices, and weak governance. Displaced people also are affected by and engaged in the process of urbanisation. Increasingly, refugees, returnees, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) are to be found not in camps or among host communities in rural areas, but in the towns and cities of developing and middle-income countries. The arrival and long-term settlement of displaced populations in urban areas needs to be better anticipated, understood, and planned for, with a particular emphasis on the establishment of new partnerships. Humanitarian actors can no longer liaise only with national governments; they must also develop urgently closer working relationships with mayors and municipal authorities, service providers, urban police forces, and, most importantly, the representatives of both displaced and resident communities. This requires linking up with those development actors that have established such partnerships already.

TI Good governance: Concept, basics, and relationship to sustainable
   development from a Palestinian perspective
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The study adopts the historical approach with a view to tracking the history, causes and important characteristics of the concept of good governance and its interrelationship with sustainable development in the Palestinian context. The study reveals that Palestinian society is considered an exception and in a great need for good governance as a result of Israel's occupation, administrative and financial corruption inherited among staff, and the Palestinians' dependence on foreign aid. It also reveals significant Palestinian efforts in the area of good governance, manifested in the signing of the convention against corruption, the establishment of the anti-corruption commission and the office of financial and administrative oversight. The results also showed that the adoption of good governance at the Palestinian level will contribute to improving the quality of life and improved relations with donor countries, improved investment environment and access to international aid and empowering marginalized groups to access their rights, and preparing Palestinians for a more realistic development role in the future community and institutional awareness and willingness to change, based on the information available at the appropriate time and place and complementary participatory relationships between different sectors, institutions and society, and everyone's participation in decision-making law-making, policymaking, resource protection, strategic decision-making and social peace. Accordingly, the study recommends that good governance should be applied as a Palestinian priority and that researchers should provide good governance indicators appropriate to Palestinian realities.

TI The tsunami of 2004 in Sri Lanka: An introduction to impacts and policy
   in the shadow of civil war Introduction
SO NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB The tsunami of 2004 and ongoing civil war in Sri Lanka are treated in the Special Issue of Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift-Norwegian Journal of Geography as two inter-related disasters. Both have been shaped by long-established patterns of vulnerability. Understanding their outcomes and offering constructive critique about policy responses depend both on explanations and models of social processes as well as an understanding of the post-tsunami policy process in the shadow of civil war. A framework is offered for analysing the policy process to which the articles in the Issue contribute. Policy process is examined in terms of policy narratives, the actors involved and their institutions. Two policy narratives constructed by international development institutions - vulnerability, and livelihood destruction and recovery - are discussed, followed by more focused policy narratives concerning internally displaced persons (IDPs), housing policy, resettlement, and the 'right to return'. They are reproduced dynamically between a range of actors, including those in civil society (differentiated by ethnicity, gender, age, wealth, social and political capital, and geographical location), international non-governmental organisations (INGOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations (CBOs), civilian government, the military, and others. Policy narratives evolve and interact reflexively with the policy process and address the impact and longer term development effects of the tsunami and the civil conflict that overshadows it.

TI Substantive but inconsistent: Canada's role in global environmental
   governance, 1968-2017
SO CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY
AB Canada has played a key leadership role in global environmental governance during specific periods since 1968, but has frequently faded from view or reversed direction as economic competiveness remained the central pillar of Canadian foreign policy. Canadian leadership on climate change and other environmental issues has proven inconsistent, torn between pressures for maximal resource extraction and the green agenda first advanced in the 1970s. Three international contextual dimensions have shaped Canadian foreign policy on environmental issues since Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was first elected in 1968. Each of these in turn is further shaped by the domestic policy context, including the party in power, federal-provincial relations, and the state of the economy. The contextual dimensions include the Canadian-American relationship (or, more broadly, the continental dimension); the global ecopolitical context defined primarily by environmental multilateralism and Canada-United Nations collaboration; and the advent of climate change as the predominant environmental issue in the post-1992 period. This paper discusses these three dimensions and offers a panoramic viewpoint on Canada's contribution to global environmental governance in the age of globalization.

TI Networks of Violence: Predicting Conflict in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB Civil conflicts are complex: multiple warring parties compete for control of territory both against each other and the government. These processes are often dynamic, changing over time and space. In this study, we embrace these complexities through a network-based approach. By considering important relational patterns, such as reciprocity and transitivity, and tying them together with existing theoretical developments in the conflict processes literature, we answer the question of "who fights whom and when" during civil conflict. Furthermore, by using the case of Nigeria, we offer novel theoretical insights about how the entrance of a new, aggressive actor can decisively alter the trajectory of conflict. In addition, we show that our approach is better at predicting "who fights whom and when" in an out-of-sample context than extant approaches.

TI 'Neither war nor peace': failed ceasefires and dispossession in
   Myanmar's ethnic borderlands
SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB A reform process initiated in 2011 in Myanmar brought hope to end decades of civil war and ethnic conflict. But new ceasefires have not moved into real political dialogue, the 'peace process' has stalled, and fighting continues in parts of the country. Economic reforms have favoured foreign investment and local elites, and have had detrimental impacts on communities in ethnic borderlands. The new ceasefires facilitated this, and coupled with economic reforms brought loss of land and related natural resources, and strengthened the central government and the military's political and economic control over ethnic borderlands. This article argues that this is a continuation of the 'neither war nor peace' policy of a previous round of ceasefires in the 1990s, but by different means. In the past this focused on coercion and military pressure, but now these military tactics have been complemented with the use of the new legal framework.

SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
AB This article studies the association between ethnic conflicts and political attitudes. It employs a new data set on the casualties of the ethnic conflict in Turkey to identify the effects of the Kurdish insurgency on the electoral behavior of the Turkish voters. The results indicate that the conflict leads to the political polarization of the society along ethnic nationalist lines. Further investigation of the data also provides some empirical support for the constructivist argument that the salience of ethnic identities is subject to change in response to external stimuli, of which ethnic conflict constitutes a drastic example.

TI Potential uses of Numerical Simulation for the Modelling of Civil
   Conflict
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB This paper explores ways in which civil conflict can be simulated using numerical methods. A general two-party model of conflict is developed by extending an approach proposed by [Christia, F., (2012), Alliance Formation in Civil Wars, Cambridge University Press, New York], which is based on a metric of the 'relative power' that exists between the state and a rebel group. Various definitions of relative power are considered and one of these is chosen to illustrate different types of two-sided armed conflict, namely direct-fire, guerrilla and asymmetric warfare. The additional suggestion of Christia that random or stochastic events can lead to unexpected conflict outcomes is also further extended in this paper. The inclusion in the model of terms describing concurrent rebel recruitment of civilians and state deployment of troops are then described. Examples are presented for various hypothetical cases. It is demonstrated that numerical simulation techniques have great potential for modelling civil war. The Christia approach is shown to provide an excellent basis from which numerical models of civil conflict can be built and from which the progress of a conflict can usefully be visualised graphically.

TI Minorities and mistrust: On the adoption of ethnic recognition to manage
   conflict
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB An enduring debate in the conflict management literature concerns the wisdom of recognizing versus avoiding reference to ethnic identities in institutions to manage ethnic conflict. Understanding why ethnic recognition occurs is crucial for informing this debate. We develop a theory based on functional and political mobilization effects of recognizing ethnic groups. Contrary to reasoning that minority leaders would be most interested in recognition, the theory suggests that recognition consistently favors the interests of leaders from larger, plurality groups, whereas minority leaders face a dilemma of recognition' between functional gains and mobilization threats. We use mixed methods to test our theory. For our quantitative analysis, we draw on an original coding of recognition in constitutions and comprehensive political settlements from 1990 to 2012. We find that for cases with leaders from plurality groups, recognition is adopted 60% of the time. With leaders from minority groups, the rate is about 40 percentage points lower, even after accounting for many background factors. Additional quantitative tests and a qualitative analysis present more detailed evidence to show that the processes correspond to the logic of our theory. Answering these questions about when and why recognition is adopted is a crucial step in evaluating its effects on conflict.

TI Engaging the Next Generation: A Field Perspective of Youth Inclusion in
   Myanmar's Peace Negotiations
SO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Literature examining the participation of youth during peace processes is limited. Previous work has often focused on youth as "peacebuilders" and agents of change or threats to peace in the post-accord period, with little emphasis on how young people participate during the negotiation phase. This article seeks to fill this gap by assessing youth inclusion and participation in Myanmar's ongoing peace negotiations. The study finds that, while youth have not had formal inclusion avenues in the peace negotiations, there are cohorts of young people who perceive themselves to be legitimate stakeholders in the peace process, who have attempted to gain access to decision-making in the peace negotiations, and have played active roles in supporting the process. It is argued that recognizing youth as key stakeholders in the peace accord will play a vital role in building sustainable peace within Myanmar's nascent democracy.

While research shows an association between human rights and foreign intervention by democracies, democratic responsiveness to children's human rights violations remains understudied. This study argues that democracies are concerned about the well-being of vulnerable populations, including children. We argue that democracies recognize the violations of children's rights in conflicts where rebels recruit child soldiers and are likely to respond by serving as mediators. Our study examines civil conflicts from 1989-2007. Findings show that while conflicts where rebel child soldiering exists are more likely to receive democratic mediation, government child soldiering has no effect.

TI Innovative urban forestry governance in Melbourne?: Investigating "green
   placemaking" as a nature-based solution
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB A nature-based approach to climate resilience aims to challenge and re-frame conventional environmental management methods by refocusing solutions from technological strategies to socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based governance models, thereby improving and legitimizing the delivery of ecosystem services (ES). There are, however, many challenges to applying a socio-ecological agenda to urban climate resilience and thereby re-framing ES delivery as community and people focused, a knowledge gap extensively outlined in the environmental governance literature. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this re-assesment of urban environmental governance by examining the City of Melbourne's approach to urban renaturing governance from a place-based perspective. Here we focus on the city's internationally-acclaimed urban forest strategy (UFS), investigating how and to which extent the governance arrangements embedded within the UFS draw strength from diverse perspectives and allow for institutional arrangements that support "situated" reflexive decision making and co-creation. We find that Melbourne's UFS governance process fosters green placemaking by re-focusing climate adaptation solutions from technological strategies to situated socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based decision making. In this sense, this case provides valuable insight for the broader UGI governance field regarding the opportunities and challenges associated with a socio-cultural approach to urban re-naturing and ES delivery.

TI Scrutinizing environmental governance in a digital age: New ways of
   seeing, participating, and intervening
SO ONE EARTH
AB Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in addressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and resource depletion. Yet, the characteristics and implications of digitalized environmental governance are still under-conceptualized. In this perspective, we distinguish three dimensions of governance: (1) seeing and knowing, (2) participation and engagement, and (3) interventions and actions. For each dimension, we provide a critical perspective on the shifts that digital technologies generate in governance. We argue against the assumption that the use of digital technologies automatically results in improved outcomes or in more democratic decision-making. Instead, attention needs to be paid to the wider political and normative context in which digital technologies are proposed, designed, and used as environmental governance tools. We conclude with key questions for academics and policymakers to broaden the debate on responsible design and use of digital technologies in environmental governance.

TI Unsettling the Peace? The Role of Illicit Economies in Peace Processes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
AB The long-term legacies of civil war economies ?often characterized by widespread illicit economic activities and the proliferation of criminal and quasi-criminal networks ?pose significant challenges to achieving sustainable postwar settlements. This essay surveys predominant strategies to address war economies in peace processes for countries emerging from war. I identify three prevailing approaches ?criminalization, co-option, and neglect ?and discuss trade-offs associated with each. While there is no clear consensus on which approach is most likely to succeed and most countries will require a balanced combination of all three, it is increasingly clear that peace agreements that fail to sufficiently incorporate the perspectives of communities dependent on illicit economies and to account for how illicit economies shape national and subnational political settlements are more likely to produce unstable postwar regimes in the medium to long-run. I conclude with some reflections on future research agendas and potential policy implications that merit further exploration.

TI Peacemaking through disentangling political order and organized crime?
   An attempt at interpreting the Colombian peace process through the lens
   of the concept of crimilegal settlement
SO MONATSSCHRIFT FUR KRIMINOLOGIE UND STRAFRECHTSREFORM
AB In the eyes of the international community, Colombia's peace process is today perceived as an example of a successful political settlement of a protracted internal armed conflict, which took its course more than half a century ago. Since the 1980s, the political-ideological causes of the conflict became ever more entwined with massive criminal interests, concerning both the rebels and the Colombian state. The present essay argues that the Cuba-based talks between the administration of President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) represent not only a conventional peace process geared at ending the long-standing armed confrontation by political means, but can also be interpreted as an instance of a special kind of negotiation leading to a "crimilegal settlement". This approach is based on previous work by the author on "crimilegal order" and "crimilegal governance", which is presented here in summary form. The article thus opens up new perspectives on the Colombian peace process, as well as the huge peacebuilding challenges the country now faces.

TI Merchants of death: Arms imports and terrorism
SO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Do arms imports fuel terrorism? Despite the high human, economic and political toll associated with terrorism, the effect of a country's arms trade on the propensity to experience terrorist attacks has received scant attention so far. We argue that arms imports affect a country's institutional landscape, increasing grievances due to corruption, exclusion and human rights violations; these grievances, in turn, incite terrorism. We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in global arms trade patterns as an instrument to provide causal evidence of a significant positive effect of arms imports on terrorist activity for 179 countries between 1992 and 2018. We also show that arms imports indeed increase corruption and political exclusion, which may explain why arms imports ultimately encourage terrorist activity. Finally, the adverse effect of arms imports on terrorism is strongest among countries characterized by low levels of fiscal capacity and high levels of political inequality and authoritarianism.

AB The proposition that environmental scarcity causes violent conflict attracts both popular and academic interest. Neomalthusian writers have developed theoretical arguments explaining this connection, and have conducted numerous case studies that seem to support the view that scarcity of biological assets such as land and other renewable resources causes conflict. So far there have been few systematic quantitative or comparative studies, and the few that exist have focused on particular forms of environmental degradation or on a small subset of resources, particularly mineral wealth. We test a more general argument about the effects of resource scarcity by examining the most widely-used measure of environmental sustainability: the ecological footprint. Contrary to neomalthusian thinking, we find that countries with a heavier footprint have a substantially greater chance of peace. Biocapacity and the ecological reserve also predict to peace, but these results are more fragile. Separate tests for smaller conflicts, for the post-Cold War period, and with additional control variables do not yield stronger support for the scarcity thesis. On the whole, the neomalthusian model of conflict receives little support from this analysis. We cannot exclude that erosion of the earth's carrying capacity can increase conflict in the long run, but an empirical analysis with the ecological footprint measure does not provide any support for such a position.

AB Previous work finds that countries that contain an excluded group are at higher risk of terrorism. However, there are good reasons to think that the impact of exclusion may be more likely to motivate ethnic violence when this exclusion is paired with local conditions that increase awareness of intergroup competition. In this study, we examine sub-national terrorist violence and find that areas that contain an excluded ethnic group are at higher risk of violence. Moreover, this risk is heightened by local population density, wealth, and country regime type.

It questions why the negotiations failed although Turkey's conditions had become ripe for resolution. This research shows that even though the ripe moment occurred before the process steered the parties toward the negotiation table, their perspectives regarding the table ultimately changed due to both domestic and international developments. Hence, the MHS seized at the beginning of the process did not turn into the MEO that would lead to resolution.

TI Can we take the pulse of environmental governance the way we take the
   pulse of nature? Applying the Freshwater Health Index in Latin America
SO AMBIO
AB Quantitative assessments have long been used to evaluate the condition of the natural environment, providing information for standard setting, adaptive management, and monitoring. Similar approaches have been developed to measure environmental governance, however, the end result (e.g., numeric indicators) belies the subjective and normative judgments that are involved in evaluating governance. We demonstrate a framework that makes this information transparent, through an application of the Freshwater Health Index in three different river basins in Latin America. Water Governance is measured on a 0-100 scale, using data derived from perception-based surveys administered to stakeholders. Results suggest that water governance is a primary area of concern in all three places, with low overall scores (Guandu-26, Alto Mayo-38, Bogota-43). We conclude that this approach to measuring governance at the river basin scale provides valuable information to support monitoring and decision making, and we offer suggestions on how it can be improved.

TI More Data, New Problems: Audiences, Ahistoricity, and Selection Bias in
   Terrorism and Insurgency Research
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW
AB The quality of social science inquiry examining terrorism, insurgency, and nonviolent civil resistance has progressed rapidly in recent years. One reason for this advancement is the emergence of new datasets and the sub-sequent application of quantitative methods to the analysis of asymmetric political conflict between states and nonstate actors. Despite rapid development within the research paradigm, the use of new data has coincided with several methodological and conceptual challenges. This inquiry employs insights from qualitative social science methodology and organizational sociology to highlight and propose solutions to three shortcomings found in recent quantitative analyses of asymmetric conflict. The first problem arises from scholars' proclivity to ask research questions based on easily accessible categories of data rather than on theoretically significant puzzles in the literature. The second pitfall concerns limitations and "conceptual stretching" associated with static, nominal variables constructed to enable statistical inference. Finally, the third class of research obstacles arises from selection bias caused by underreporting of data. Each of these methodological problems potentially undermines theoretical claims made in recent work on insurgent organizations, terrorism, civil war, and nonviolent resistance.

TI Embryonic forms of private environmental governance in Northeast Asia
SO PACIFIC REVIEW
AB This article provides empirical evidence of the emergence of new private governance forms through three case studies: transboundary air pollution, green supply chain, and energy transition in Northeast Asia. This article also refers to private governance theories discussed in the context of global environmental governance. Consistent with the private authority theory, entrepreneurs with vast expertise and capacity to provide useful information and practices have emerged. They allow stakeholders to cooperate in regional environmental sustainability under the conditions of weak or no focal institutions and heterogeneous state preferences. This observation is consistent with the global trend of environmental governance, which is shifting from regulatory-based to goal-setting governance. As global partnership theory suggests, hybrid forms of private governance, including various local- to global-level public-private partnerships, emerge across the cases. However, these forms of governance are still in the embryonic stage, where their functions of private authority are not fully developed. These insights challenge the predominant view on the limited roles of nonstate actors in building regional environmental governance in Northeast Asia as discussed in the existing literature.

AB This paper considers the role of aimed conflict, and attitudes to the study of armed conflict, in an evaluation of international conflict resolution. Its primary method is an investigation of the literature and consideration of analytical approaches adopted by International Conflict Resolution Research. We demonstrate that armed conflict is a major tool used by countries, with a high degree of effectiveness. We adopt a primarily theoretical, realist approach to analysis of the field.
   Our findings and conclusions are that the exclusion of armed conflict from the analysis of international conflict resolution methods is not justified conceptually and leads to a warped analysis of party behaviours in conflict situations. We consider this as a substantial finding, which questions long-standing assumptions in the field. Our conclusions could have dramatic practical implications, in the form of changed approaches to analysis of conflict resolution, with better guidance to researchers and conflict resolution practitioners alike.

TI The political ecology of transition in Cambodia 1989-1999: War, peace
   and forest exploitation
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB Over the last decade, forests have played an important role in the transition from war to peace in Cambodia. Forest exploitation financed the continuation of war beyond the Cold War and regional dynamics, yet it also stimulated co-operation between conflicting parties. Timber represented a key stake in the rapacious transition from the (benign) socialism of the post-Khmer Rouge period to (exclusionary) capitalism, thereby becoming the most politicized resource of a reconstruction process that has failed to be either as green or as democratic as the international community had hoped. This article explores the social networks and power politics shaping forest exploitation, with the aim of casting light on the politics of transition. It also scrutinizes the unintended consequences of the international community's discourse of democracy, good governance, and sustainable development on forest access rights. The commodification of Cambodian forests is interpreted as a process of transforming nature into money through a political ecology of transition that legitimates an exclusionary form of capitalism.

Currently, while legal and human rights approaches are important, people with disabilities in Colombia do not generally have the resources to fight for their own rights. However, there could be opportunities in the negotiations currently with the National Liberation Army (ELN) to include a specific focus on the rights of people with disabilities.

TI Why negotiate peace? An analysis of the start of negotiations in the
   armed conflict in Colombia
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB The conflict in Colombia has seemed insolvable for decades. Despite several peace attempts, it has always flared up again. In this article, I explain the onset of peace negotiations in 2012 between the Government of Colombia and the FARC, the largest guerrilla group in the country. I claim the fundamental explanation for why they initiated negotiations was the military weakening of the FARC in the 2000s, which led the guerrilla group to appreciate the necessity of ending the conflict through negotiation in order to reach at least some of their goals. The second most important factor was the change in leadership in Colombia, where in 2010 the newly-elected president, Juan Manuel Santos, considered a political solution possible and more attractive than his predecessor did, and took pragmatic measures to create a sustainable process. In addition, third parties contributed to safe and secret proceedings and to trust in the peace process. Negotiations begun in 2012 are - through a structured, focused comparison - compared with the peace dialogue in Caguan (1999-2002) between the same actors, where negotiation did not start. Case studies like this one can help us understand dynamics behind the choices of armed actors to pursue political solutions to armed conflicts. The onset of negotiation, which I analyze, must not be equated with a peace agreement or the end of the conflict. It can, however, provide important answers about where armed actors' motivation to end conflicts come from, and under what conditions this motivation can bring the parties to the negotiating table.

TI The Consequences of Contention: Understanding the Aftereffects of
   Political Conflict and Violence
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 22
SE Annual Review of Political Science
AB What are the political and economic consequences of contention (i.e., genocide, civil war, state repression/human rights violation, terrorism, and protest)? Despite a significant amount of interest as well as quantitative research, the literature on this subject remains underdeveloped and imbalanced across topic areas. To date, investigations have been focused on particular forms of contention and specific consequences. While this research has led to some important insights, substantial limitations-as well as opportunities for future development-remain. In particular, there is a need for simultaneously investigating a wider range of consequences (beyond democracy and economic development), a wider range of contentious activity (beyond civil war, protest, and terrorism), a wider range of units of analysis (beyond the nation year), and a wider range of empirical approaches in order to handle particular difficulties confronting this type of inquiry (beyond ordinary least-squares regression). Only then will we have a better and more comprehensive understanding of what contention does and does not do politically and economically. This review takes stock of existing research and lays out an approach for looking at the problem using a more comprehensive perspective.

TI Blue Economy and Competing Discourses in International Oceans Governance
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB In this article, we track a relatively new term in global environmental governance: blue economy. Analyzing preparatory documentation and data collected at the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (i.e., Rio+20), we show how the term entered into use and how it was articulated within four competing discourses regarding human-ocean relations: (a) oceans as natural capital, (b) oceans as good business, (c) oceans as integral to Pacific Small Island Developing States, and (d) oceans as small-scale fisheries livelihoods. Blue economy was consistently invoked to connect oceans with Rio+20's green economy theme; however, different actors worked to further define the term in ways that prioritized particular oceans problems, solutions, and participants. It is not clear whether blue economy will eventually be understood singularly or as the domain of a particular actor or discourse. We explore possibilities as well as discuss discourse in global environmental governance as powerful and precarious.

TI A local to global perspective on resource governance and conflict
SO CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
AB This article serves as an introduction to the special issue 'A Local to Global Perspective on Resource Governance and Conflict'. It advances the debate on natural resource governance and conflict by bringing together three different strands of literature with the aim of developing a local to global research perspective and framework for analysis. First, this article reviews and identifies research gaps in the literatures on (1) the resource curse, (2) environmental security and (3) the large-scale acquisition of land and natural resources. Second, it addresses the previously identified research gaps by developing a local to global research perspective and a corresponding analytical framework. The final section of this contribution summarises the key findings of the articles presented in the special issue and outlines their policy implications.

TI Civil war: is it all about disease and xenophobia? A comment on
   Letendre, Fincher & Thornhill
SO BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB Letendre, Fincher & Thornhill (2010) argue that pathogen intensity provides the ultimate explanation for why some countries are more prone to civil war than others. They argue that the economic and political factors highlighted in previous research on civil war are largely caused by underlying differences in pathogen intensity, and contend that disease proneness increases the risk of civil war through its effects on resource competition and xenophobia. They present empirical evidence that they interpret as consistent with their argument: a statistically significant correlation between pathogen intensity and civil war onset. In this comment, we raise concerns over their interpretation of the empirical evidence and their proposed causal mechanisms. We find that the data provide stronger evidence for the reverse causal relationship, namely that civil war causes disease to become more prevalent. This finding is consistent with the literatures on the public health effects of civil war as well as research on state capacity and public health.

TI New Incentives and Old Organizations: The Production of Violence After
   War
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB The immediate aftermath of an armed conflict is a key window of opportunity to build sustainable peace and security. Whether and how violence arises during that time has profound effects on a country's political and economic development. Yet, conceptualizing post-conflict violence has remained elusive. Much of this difficulty arises because post-conflict violence is a liminal phenomenon with a dual nature: it emerges during transitions from war to peace and is a combination of new strategic incentives and wartime organizational legacies. This paper contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of post-conflict violence with a theory-grounded typology, based on two axes: strategic aims (predatory, constructive) and degrees of cooperation (directed, coordinated, spontaneous). The premise of this categorizing effort is that with a more solid grasp of the mechanisms driving post-conflict violence and its variation we can design more suitable policies to lower its incidence.

TI A Human Rights Approach to Conflict Resolution
SO ETHICS & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Human rights and conflict resolution have been traditionally perceived as two separate fields, with contradictory principles and conflicting approaches toward achieving peace. This essay aims to understand these two fields in a more integrative way, showing how a human rights perspective can enrich the theory and practice of conflict resolution. It clarifies the main characteristics of a human rights approach to conflict resolution and identifies a set of human rights standards guiding its implementation: a normative legal framework; structural conditions for peace; participation and inclusion; and accountability and redress. The essay also briefly applies a human rights approach to the Colombian peace process and to the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The conclusion addresses one of the main criticisms of this approach and its principal challenges.

TI Civil-Military Relations and Civil War Recurrence: Security Forces in
   Postwar Politics
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Does restructuring security forces reduce the risk of civil war recurrence? Prior research has examined effects of military integration in alleviating commitment problems, but the evidence has been inconclusive. Other aspects of civil-military relations have received less attention. This article examines the effects of civil-military relations in the context of postwar struggles to consolidate authority. It outlines three pathways through which security forces contribute to renewed civil war: by excluding rival factions and facilitating insurgent mobilization, by exploiting control over resources to challenge the regime, or by escalating incipient insurgency through repression. Analysis of original, cross-national data on postwar civil-military relations shows that reducing the potential for exclusion and exploitation through diverse officer appointments and robust civilian oversight lowers the risk of civil war. These findings emphasize the distributive effects of restructuring security forces and highlight the value of examining political contests around state institutions to understand why civil wars restart.

TI Beauty: A Lingua Franca for Environmental Law?
SO TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
AB This article investigates whether beauty in nature can provide a global language to inform environmental governance, such as by providing shared values and collaborative approaches across and within different cultures. Because art mediates how many people experience environmental aesthetics, such as through photography and music, this enquiry extends to the arts. As is the case for other aesthetic values, beauty is ultimately about relationships and ways of knowing our environment, and the law can best engage with such values through interpretive guidance and processes for participatory decision making. Prescriptive codification of beauty 'standards' is generally not a realistic goal for lawmakers. The article enriches our understanding of how aesthetics can contribute to human beings' emotional empathy and ethical commitment to environmental stewardship, and identifies some conceptual and methodological difficulties that militate against beauty being a lingua franca for environmental law.

The ARC dataset contains 17 variables covering organization-level features such as type, age, leadership, goals, and interorganizational alliances. These data facilitate new measurements of key concepts in the study of contentious politics, such as the social and ideological diversity of resistance episodes, in addition to measures of network centralization and fragmentation. The ARC dataset helps resolve existing debates in the field and opens new avenues of inquiry.

TI Political Exclusion, Oil, and Ethnic Armed Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Why do members of some ethnic groups rebel against the state? One approach holds that groups subject to exclusion from national politics engage in armed conflict. We theorize that the presence of resource wealth moderates the effect of political exclusion. Ethnic groups subject to exclusion whose settlement area includes oil wealth are more likely to experience the onset of armed conflict than groups experiencing exclusion alone. We depart from the convention of cross-national analysis to examine subnational, geocoded units of analysisethnic group settlement areasto better capture the impact of natural resource distribution. Using data on ethnic group political exclusion derived from the Ethnic Power Relations database and geo-coded indicators, we conduct a series of logistic regression analyses for the years 1946 to 2005. We find that exclusion alone increase the likelihood of conflict, while the presence of oil wealth further raises the risk of war.

TI Strengthening Diabetes Care in Humanitarian Crises in Low- and
   Middle-income Settings
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Amid the growing global diabetes epidemic, the scale of forced displacement resulting from armed conflict and humanitarian crises is at record-high levels. More than 80% of the displaced population lives in lower- and middle-income countries, which also host 81% of the global population living with diabetes. Most crises are protracted, often lasting decades, and humanitarian aid organizations are providing long-term primary care to both the local and displaced populations. Humanitarian crises are extremely varied in nature and occur in contexts that are diverse and dynamic. The scope of providing diabetes care varies depending on the phase of the crisis. This paper describes key challenges and possible solutions to improving diabetes care in crisis settings. It focuses on (1) ensuring a reliable supply of life preserving medications and diagnostics, (2) restoring and maintaining access to health care, and (3) adapting service design to the context. These challenges are illustrated through case studies in Ukraine, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Jordan.

TI The Analytical Framework of Governance in Health Policies in the Face of
   Health Emergencies: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The Governance Analytical Framework (MAG) defines governance as a social fact, endowed with analyzable and interpretable characteristics, through what it calls observable constitutive elements of governance: the problem, the actors, the social norms, the process of decision-making and scope or nodal points; in the sense that each society develops its modes of governance, its decision-making or conflict resolution systems among its members, its norms, and institutions. In this perspective, the purpose of this article was to carry out a systematic review of the scientific literature to understand the role of governance in health policies in health emergencies, such as that caused by the SARS-CoV-2. The systematic review was designed based on the methodology proposed in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) Declaration. The literature search was carried out in six databases: Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, APA-PsycInfo, MEDLINE, eBook Collection (EBSCOhost), PubMED, and MedicLatina, published in the last 5 years. Fifteen articles that met quality and evidence criteria were analyzed. The governance approach alluding to the health emergency problem in health policies was the most addressed by the authors (80%), followed by a description of the actors (40%), the process of decision-making spaces (33%), and ultimately, social norms or rules with 13%. Formulating a coherent set of global health policies within a large-scale global governance framework is mostly absent. Although the countries adopt international approaches, it is a process differentiated by the social, economic, and political contexts between countries, affecting heterogeneous health outcomes over the pandemic.

TI Migrate, Cooperate, or Resist: The Civilians' Dilemma in the Colombian
   Civil War, 1988-2010
SO LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
AB By using innovative microlevel data from Colombia's civil war, this article examines protests, one of many actions that civilians employ to resists peacefully armed actors during civil war. By using a cost-benefit analysis, the author argues that inhabitants can mobilize and solve their collective action problem when the costs of migrating or supporting one side in a war are too expensive. By examining the civil conflict on Colombia between 1988 and 2010, the author finds that civilians are likely to protest armed actors under three conditions. First, autonomous communities, which enjoy benefits associated with their territory, are likely to protest because migration would be costly; moreover, the institutional strength of these communities can decrease the costs of mobilization against armed actors. Second, foreign aid distributed through nongovernmental associations can empower individuals to take action by providing selective incentives for mobilization, thus decreasing costs. Last, high levels of violence, up to a certain threshold, increase the costs of nonparticipation and induce civilian action.

TI From a Climate of Complexity to Sustainable Peace: Viability
   Transformations and Adaptive Governance in the Anthropocene
SO HANDBOOK ON SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITION AND SUSTAINABLE PEACE
SE Hexagon Series on Human and Environmental Security and Peace
AB In an increasingly interconnected climate of complexity, the stabilization of human-environment interactions is a major challenge in international relations and demands the integration of complexity science with global governance. This chapter highlights several cases of complex crises where cascading events affect international stability. Climate change is considered as a risk multiplier which disturbs the balance between natural and social systems and amplifies the consequences through complex impact chains that affect the functioning of critical infrastructures and supply networks; intensify the nexus of water, energy and food; lead to production losses, price increases and financial crises in other regions through global markets; undermine human security, social living conditions and political stability; and trigger or aggravate migration movements and conflict situations. An integrative framework of human-environment interaction is used to analyse destabilizing developments, tipping elements and cascading risks, as well as concepts of resilience, viability and sustainable peace. Whether climate stress fuels a cycle of violence or climate policy drives a transition towards a cycle of cooperation and sustainable peace depends on the human and societal responses. Strategies for viability transformations and adaptive governance range from climate mitigation and adaptation and the building of social networks to new capabilities of disaster management, crisis prevention and conflict resolution. Several examples are presented showing how transition and transformation processes can be analysed with an agent-based model framework.

TI Climate Wars? Assessing the Claim That Drought Breeds Conflict
SO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
AB Dominant climate models suggest that large parts of Africa will experience greater climatic variability and increasing rates of drought in coming decades. This could have severe societal consequences, because the economies and food supplies of most African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture. According to leading environmental security scholars, policymakers, and nongovernmental organizations, an increase in scarcity-driven armed conflicts should also be expected. A conditional theory of environmental conflict predicts that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. However, an empirical evaluation of this general proposition through a unique gridded dataset of postcolonial Africa, which combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethnopolitical context, shows little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.

TI Experiences of pregnancy in adolescence of internally displaced women in
   Bogota: an ethnographic approach
SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB Background Pregnancy in adolescence is higher among internally displaced women in Colombia than non-displaced women. It is defined as a problem with significant negative outcomes by both biomedical and epidemiological approaches. However, little is known about pregnancy during adolescence from the perspective of women who experienced this in the specific context of armed conflict and displacement. Aim This article focuses on how internally displaced women understand their experiences of pregnancy in adolescence in the context of armed conflict through an ethnographic approach in a receptor community of internally displaced women in Bogota, Colombia. Methods Based on 10 years of experience in the community, we conducted 1 year of fieldwork, using an ethnographic approach. We collected life stories of 20 internally displaced women through in-depth interviews and ran 8 workshops with them and other women from the community. We used thematic analysis to analyse the responses of internally-displaced women and understand how they made meaning around their experiences of adolescent pregnancy in the context of displacement. Results The main themes that emerged from participants' experiences include rural violence, early family life (characterized by violence and mistreatment at home), meanings of pregnancy at an early age (including being challenged and feelings of love), and reactions to their pregnancies during adolescence (such as stigmatization) from their families and partners. Conclusion Our analysis of the in-depth interviews and the workshops suggests that adolescent pregnancy among women who are internally displaced has complex dynamics, characterized by the violent context of the rural areas, but primarily by the violence experienced during their childhood. The experience of pregnancy during adolescence brings feelings of ownership and also challenges, together with the forced displacement. This understanding will provide insights for policy makers and healthcare providers on how to work with this specific population who have experienced pregnancy in adolescence.

TI Challenges to Peace: conflict resolution in the Great Lakes region of
   Africa
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Efforts to bring peace and reconstruction to the Central African region have been fashioned by contemporary conflict resolution models that have a standard formula of peace negotiations, with a trajectory of cease. re agreements, transitional governments, demilitarization, constitutional reform and ending with democratic elections. Local dynamics and the historical and multifaceted nature of the conflicts are rarely addressed. Furthermore, participants in the peace process are restricted to representatives of political parties, the state and rebel movements, to the exclusion of civil society. Using as examples the conflicts and peace processes in three Great Lakes countries Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo - the paper contends that contemporary global frameworks for peacemaking and peace building that rest on the acceptance of neoliberal political and economic models cannot lay the foundations for the conditions necessary for sustainable peace. This necessitates the utilisation of a more inclusive concept of peace, the starting point of which has to be the emancipation of African humanity.

TI Refugees and the spread of civil war
SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB Certain regions of the world experience more conflict than others. Previous analyses have shown that a civil war in one Country significantly increases the likelihood that neighboring states will experience conflict. This finding, however, still remains largely unexplained. We argue that population movements are an important mechanism by which conflict spreads across regions. Refugee flows are not only the consequence of political turmoil-the presence of refugees and displaced populations can also increase the risk of subsequent conflict in host and origin countries. Refugees expand rebel social networks and constitute a negative externality of civil war. Although the vast majority of refugees never directly engage in violence, refugee flows may facilitate the transnational spread of arms, combatants, and ideologies conducive to conflict; they alter the ethnic composition of the state; and they can exacerbate economic competition. We conduct an empirical analysis of the link between refugees and civil conflict since the mid-twentieth century, and we find that the presence of refugees from neighboring countries leads to an increased probability of violence, suggesting that refugees are one important source of conflict diffusion.

TI Citizen preferences on private-public co-regulation in environmental
   governance: Evidence from Switzerland
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Environmental policy is touching on ever more aspects of corporate and individual behavior, and there is much debate over what combinations of top-down (government-imposed) and bottom-up (voluntary private sector) measures to use. In democratic societies, citizens' preferences over such combinations are crucial because they shape the political mandates based on which policymakers act. We argue that policy designs that involve privatepublic co-regulation receive more citizen support if they are based on inclusive decision-making, use strong transparency and monitoring mechanisms, and include a trigger for government intervention in case of ineffectiveness. Survey experiments in Switzerland (N = 1941) provide strong support for these arguments. Our research demonstrates that differences in co-regulation design have major implications for public support. Another key finding is that there seems to be a contradiction between inclusiveness and democratic accountability for policy outcomes. The findings are surprisingly consistent across two very different green economy issues we focus on empirically (decarbonization of finance, pesticides). This suggests that our study design offers a useful template for research that explores public opinion on green economy policy designs for other issues and in other countries.

TI Green silk roads, partner state development, and environmental
   governance: Belt and road infrastructure on the Sino-East African
   frontier
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
AB China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is reorienting global development. Few scholars, however, query relationships between green silk road discourse, BRI infrastructure, partner state development goals, and environmental governance. This article details the roots of green silk road discourse in efforts to environmentally engineer China's desert landscapes. Much like large-scale nature-based infrastructure projects in China, BRI infrastructure projects abroad precipitate a range of socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. Through juxtaposing terrestrial infrastructure development in Ethiopia with maritime infrastructure development in Djibouti, the article demonstrates how different types of BRI infrastructure projects shape environmental governance and advance the development agendas of partner countries. Sugar plantations, roads, railways, and energy infrastructure in Ethiopia further Ethiopian state development plans while transforming Indigenous people's relations to their land and livelihoods. In Djibouti, port infrastructure and military bases figure centrally in strategic rentiership for the Djiboutian state with ancillary effects on fisheries and international trade. The article illustrates how relative articulations between East African central government development interests, environmental governance, and infrastructure are mediated by varieties of Chinese capital. The comparative analysis disrupts simplistic narratives of "win-win" partnerships and "China as threat" to partner state autonomy.

TI Civil War and the Formation of Social Trust in Kosovo: Posttraumatic
   Growth or War-related Distress?
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB While a new, growing subset of the literature argues that armed conflict does not necessarily erode social cohesion in the postwar era, we challenge this perspective and examine how civil war experiences shape social trust in Kosovo after the war from 1998 to 1999. Based on a nationwide survey conducted in 2010 and the disaggregated conflict event data set of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, we simultaneously analyze the impact of individual war-related experiences and exposure to war in the community through hierarchical analyses of twenty-six municipalities. Our findings confirm that civil war is negatively related to social trust. This effect proves to be more conclusive for individual war experiences than for contextual war exposure. Arguably, the occurrence of instances of violence with lasting psychological as well as social structural consequences provides people with clear evidence of the untrustworthiness, uncooperativeness, and hostility of others, diminishing social trust in the aftermath of war.

TI Monitoring the moneylenders: Institutional accountability and
   environmental governance at the World Bank's Inspection Panel
SO EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB This article discusses how Independent Accountability Mechanisms (IAMs) such as an Inspection Panel have the potential to improve both the legitimacy and environmental governance of multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank. The World Bank provides loans and credit to developing countries to stimulate social and economic development in an attempt to alleviate poverty, often investing in infrastructure projects such as pipelines, power plants, and oil and gas fields. With billions in annual lending, the World Bank is the largest international financial institution in the world. Between 1994, when it started operations, and June 2015, the World Bank Inspection Panel received 103 requests for inspection across more than 50 countries that resulted in 34 approved investigations. Based on a qualitative case study methodology, the study finds that institutional accountability has inherent value in improving the internal governance of an institution-in this case the World Bank-and its ability to achieve development and sustainability goals. Yet to be effective, such governance needs steered by committed and independent leaders on all sides, and there are limits to what IAMs such as the IP can accomplish. Understanding the internal dynamics, processes, and accountability mechanisms of the World Bank offers a rare chance to test the efficacy of institutional accountability in practice. Moreover, this study shows how attributes reflecting independence, impartiality, transparency, professionalism, accessibility, and responsiveness are crucial to improving governance outcomes and more equitable decision-making processes-themes highly relevant to public policy and development studies as well as environmental governance and the extractive industries.

TI Entrepreneurship as Boundary Object: Toward Reintegration of Colombia's
   Ex-Militants into Civil Society
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB War and other violent conflicts greatly degrade a country's economic, social, and marketing systems. In the aftermath of conflict, national and international organizations develop different strategies, such as business development, aimed at the reconstruction of these systems. This article draws on boundary theory to frame the way in which entrepreneurship can help ex-militants to discard war-activities and to reintegrate peacefully and productively into a peace-time economy. An interpretive study examining the life-narratives of former militants of illegal groups involved in Colombia's armed conflict - the world's longest, lasting 52 years - regarding their business start-ups was designed and administered. Findings extend current Macromarketing and Entrepreneurship literature by showing how policies and entrepreneurial business practices in recovering marketing systems can help ex-militants to overcome discrimination, to transform their identities and to reintegrate peacefully into civil society, which in turn may portend a more inclusive and equitable marketing system and robust national economy.

Post-mortem changes were considered to be signs of torture and post-mortem mutilation. This example demonstrates how political purposes may falsify results of a forensic investigation.

TI Developing environmental governance research: the example of forest
   cover change studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB Environmental problems are often complex and it is widely recognized that they cannot be satisfactorily addressed by single disciplines. The review of forest cover change studies points to the need to carry out research integrating economic, political, social and environmental aspects. Existing interdisciplinary study areas, namely ecological economics, political ecology, sustainability science and Earth system governance do not yet fully integrate all the required aspects. This paper points out that the establishment of greater synergies between those study areas would be beneficial in developing the broader study area of environmental governance. A definition of environmental governance as a subject of study is developed. Lack of an all encompassing theory of environmental governance is highlighted, while the improbability of such a theory is acknowledged. In relation to normative work, the refinement of principles of good environmental governance could support the design and prioritization of policies. Empirical research needs to include the testing of hypotheses arising from theoretical developments, assessment of policy uptake and new exploratory research. Methodologically, environmental governance might start from an interdisciplinary approach followed by further integration leading to a transdisciplinary study area that uses a mixed methods research approach.

This paper contributes to the debate by identifying autonomy as a dual-use technology: under conditions of peace, autonomy acts to maintain a unified state; under large-scale political violence (civil war), autonomy increases the probability of an ethnic group's region emerging as an independent state. I present a cross-national, statistical test of this theory during the post-1945 period.

TI Understanding victimological factors when analysing Organised Crime
   characteristics: A human trafficking perspective
SO SALUS JOURNAL
AB It was identified through this Australian study that organised crime groups operate in a variety of criminal markets and as a result the methods of organised crime groups also vary. Utilising the Sleipnir framework of Organised Crime to analyse the characteristics of organised crime groups, it emerged that the Sleipnir framework did not reflect the link or reliance an organised crime group may have on victims to succeed in their criminal endeavours. Human trafficking is a crime type where victimisation of an individual would be considered an essential element to undertake the crime. This led to the development of a Victimological Framework and further defined the organised crime attribute of 'victimisation', which was incorporated into the research on the context of organised crime involvement in sex-trafficking crimes in Australia. Understanding and identifying an organised crime groups' ability and need to victimise individuals, groups or businesses is an important element to understanding the context of organised criminal offending.

TI A diamond curse? Civil war and a lootable resource
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB While territory, oil, and water are frequently mentioned as resources likely to promote interstate conflict, diamonds have emerged as a prominent factor in explanations of civil war. In this article, the authors report on a new database on diamond deposits and production and analyze the relationship between diamonds and armed conflict incidence. They find a strong bivariate relationship between diamonds (particularly secondary diamonds) and the onset of civil war. Adding diamond dummies to standard models of civil war, the results are more mixed. The production of secondary diamonds increases the risk of onset of ethnic war, but not other types of war. The authors find evidence that secondary diamonds are positively related to the incidence of civil war, especially in countries divided along ethnic lines. Primary diamonds, on the other hand, make ethnic war onset and incidence less likely. The authors also find that the impact of diamonds has been substantially stronger in the post-cold war era.

TI Lost in Space? The spatial and scalar dimensions of organised crime in
   the Pacific
SO ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
AB Two theoretical frameworks frame the spatial dimensions of organised crime. The first, which has shaped international responses to the problem, stresses the scalar and territorial nature of the problem; the second (and recently emerging) has drawn on network theories to suggest that organised crime is ascalar and operates through fluid relationships between people, places and things. We suggest that these viewpoints tend to bifurcate scalar and flat ontologies and argue that understanding and responding to organised crime requires engaging with theories of scale and networks simultaneously. We bring this theoretical insight to bear on a case study: we examine the way state power has shaped organised crime and responses to it across the Pacific. The case study highlights that responses to organised crime are by and large driven by scalar and state-based responses, which have been shaped by political power. In contrast, organised crime constitutes networked relations that are significantly shaped by administrative and political scales. The paper argues that the disjuncture between the nature of responses to organised crime helps perpetuate the problem. It also highlights the advantages of greater dialogue between scalar and networked theories of organised crime.

   reintroductions: are democratic principles at stake?
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Contemporary governance systems have been characterised as multi-actor' and multi-level', but the consequences of such greater complexity for core principles of democracy remain uncertain. To investigate the effects of these late-modern governance shifts, we used political decision making on Scottish reintroductions of charismatic animals as a case study. Based on interviews with key actors engaged in the reintroduction of the white-tailed eagle, beaver and (potentially) lynx, we analysed the impact of governance shifts against four selected democratic principles. We found that new modes of governance can make decision-making processes look better than they actually are, and may even harm democratic principles.

TI Too partial to work? Informal institutions in the midst of climate
   change and armed conflict in central Mali
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB In situations characterised by armed conflict and climate change, can informal institutions resolve conflict around shrinking resources? It is widely acknowledged that low state capacity increases the likelihood of violence in the context of climate change. In such context, informal institutions should play a crucial role in preventing and mitigating violence in the absence of formal institutions. However, little is known of the characteristics of these informal institutions and existing literature on climate change and conflict has examined them in isolation from national contexts and actors. This paper seeks to address this gap and argues that impartiality is essential for the ability of informal institutions to resolve resource-based conflict, a by-product of climate change, and prevent violence escalation. However, when institutions are partial, because of co-option by the state or other external actors, their decisions may further increase communal violence and prolong civil conflict. Partial institutions can encourage people to take justice into their own hands, and push individuals to join rebel groups offering more favourable

TI The Use of 'Macro' Legal Analysis in the Understanding and Development
   of Global Environmental Governance
SO TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
AB This article examines the manner in which macro' legal analysis can potentially assist in overcoming some of the issues that are faced in the understanding and development of global environmental governance (GEG). It argues that the analysis of law through separate and distinct disciplines - such as environmental law, trade law, corporate law, and human rights law - results in what this article refers to as micro' legal analysis. As such, it contends that this can have the effect of creating obstacles in the development of coherent and effective legal and policy choices related to the protection of the environment. It illustrates these arguments with examples of practical problems that have arisen from the separation of legal issues in practice and provides the theoretical underpinnings, based on the critique of international lawyers, for the application of macro' legal analysis. In other words, it argues for a form of analysis that would consider the entire range of relevant legal disciplines in a unitary process. It then provides a methodology for the development and application of macro' legal analysis in relation to environmental issues. Finally, it considers the potential that this approach could have within the field of GEG and comments on the implications that it could have for the way in which lawyers are trained in the future.

TI Gender, mental health and resilience in armed conflict: listening to
   life stories of internally displaced women in Colombia
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB For over 60 years, Colombia has endured violent civil conflict forcibly displacing more than 8 million people. Recent efforts have begun to explore mental health consequences of these contexts, with an emphasis on national surveys. To date few Colombian studies explore mental health and well-being from a lived experience perspective. Those that do, overlook processes that enable survival. In response to this gap, we conducted a life history study of seven internally displaced Colombian women in the Cundinamarca department, analysing 18 interview sessions and 36 hours of transcripts. A thematic network analysis, informed by Latin-American perspectives on gender and critical resilience frameworks, explored women's coping strategies in response to conflict-driven hardships related to mental well-being. Analysis illuminated that: (1) the gendered impacts of the armed conflict on women's emotional well-being work through exacerbating historical gendered violence and inequality, intensifying existing emotional health challenges, and (2) coping strategies reflect women's ability to mobilise cognitive, bodied, social, material and symbolic power and resources. Our findings highlight that the sociopolitical contexts of women's lives are inseparable from their efforts to achieve mental well-being, and the value of deep narrative and historical work to capturing the complexity of women's experiences within conflict settings. We suggest the importance of social interventions to support the mental health of women in conflict settings, in order to centre the social and political contexts faced by such marginalised groups within efforts to improve mental health.

TI Multi-level governance and competing sustainability aims: Politics of
   renewable energy development and nature conservation in Changdao, China
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Governmental departments at various levels and non-governmental actors have been competing over land use for renewable energy development and biodiversity conservation. This study decontextualizes the logic of green-green conflict resolution employing a multi-level governance framework and qualitative methods in China's Changdao district of Yantai city, where the primary development goal has been shifting from a pilot wind energy site to a marine ecological demonstration zone. We find that the central government and environmental NGOs raise questions about the green-green conflict and drive the local government to solve it. The local government, particularly the provincial government, plays a key role in creating platforms for cross-sector and multi-level negotiations, and collaboration among various actors with diverse interests to find innovative solutions. Regarding the many possible land uses, the results suggest that collaboration between governments, companies, and NGOs in multi-level governance is essential in managing the trade-offs between different sustainability aims to create a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of meeting such goals.

TI Equity norms in global environmental governance
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Contestations over justice and equity in international environmental regimes present striking evidence of the struggle to create institutions for global environmental governance that are based on widely shared ethical standards of responsibility and accountability. Focusing on two key equity norms-the common heritage of mankind (CHM) and common but differentiated responsibility (CDR)-this paper highlights four factors that affect the influence of moral responsibility norms in global environmental regimes: (i) source and force of articulation; (ii) nature of issue-area; (iii) "moral temper" of the international community; and (iv) "fitness" of norms with the prevailing neoliberal economic idea and structure. Consequent upon the argument that the most important of all these factors is the "fitness" with the extant neoliberal order, the paper questions the assumptions of the burgeoning constructivist scholarship that tends to overemphasize the independent role of intersubjective beliefs in international politics. Further, it is suggested that the abiding "responsibility deficit" in institutions for global environmental governance is due mostly to the successful co-optation of equity norms for neoliberal ends.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Previous studies of internal armed conflict outcomes have found evidence that rebel-biased military intervention increases the likelihood of rebel victory, but little indication that pro-government interventions improve the odds of government victory. Our argument, grounded in a theory of the utility and limitations of military force in civil wars, anticipates that armed intervention increases the probability of victory for the supported side only when that belligerent's primary challenge is a lack of conventional war-fighting capacity. Empirical analyses of internal armed conflicts from 1945 to 2010 support these expectations. Direct interventions in support of opposition movements have substantively large, robust effects on conflict outcomes. In contrast, government-biased interventions are only effective in increasing the odds of an outcome favorable to the government when the fighting capacity of rebel forces matches or exceeds that of the state.

TI WHY DO ETHNIC GROUPS REBEL? New Data and Analysis
SO WORLD POLITICS
AB Much of the quantitative literature on civil wars and ethnic conflict ignores the role of the state or treats it as a mere arena for political competition among ethnic groups. Other studies analyze how the state grants or withholds minority rights and faces ethnic protest and rebellion accordingly, while largely overlooking the ethnic power configurations at the state's center. Drawing on a new data set oil Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) that identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups and their access to central state power around the world from 1946 through 2005, the authors analyze outbreaks of armed conflict as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. The findings indicate that representatives of ethnic groups are more likely to initiate conflict with the government (1) the more excluded from state power they are, especially if they have recently lost power, (2) the higher their mobilizational capacity, and (3) the more they have experienced conflict in the past.

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB My central aim in this paper is to evaluate the outcomes of the amnesty programme established in mid-2009 by the Nigerian government as a way of resolving the groundswell of violence in the oil-rich Niger Delta region. In particular, I focus analytic attention on the planning and implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process of the amnesty. I argue that while the amnesty promotes non-killing alternatives to conflict resolution and opens a door for stabilisation, its current planning and implementation is flawed and unable to reduce the long-term potential for armed conflict in the Niger Delta. Far from been a transformational strategy, I argue that the amnesty programme has become a strategy of gilded pacification essentially targeted at buying off militants and re-establishing oil and gas production in the Niger Delta without addressing the multilayered causes of peacelessness in the region.

TI Sooner or later: The timing of ethnic conflict onsets after independence
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB A well-known finding in the literature on ethnic conflict is that new states are more prone to ethnic conflict than old states. What are less well known, however, are the mechanisms through which independence leads to ethnic conflict. This lacuna is surprising since the literature offers different mechanisms to explain the result, each pointing to very distinct policy responses. This article examines these mechanisms by analyzing variations in the time from independence until an ethnic group engaged in armed conflict in ex-British colonies using an original colonial legacies dataset covering 177 ethnic groups in 33 ex-colonies. My analysis reveals that the main group-level triggers of early conflict onset are perceptions of backwardness, exclusion from political power on the eve of independence, downgrading of political status in the immediate aftermath of independence, and being regionally based. More generally, I find that shorter durations of post-independence peace are better explained by subjective evaluations of group worth instead of rational assessments of the costs and benefits of mobilization. These findings indicate that power-sharing arrangements may be a sine qua non for stabilizing new states in divided societies since what is at play in these contexts are complex considerations of group status that cannot be accommodated by non-ethnic institutional arrangements.

TI Access to land and the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil in Colombia
SO GLOBALIZATIONS
AB In the wake of the 2008 triple crisis (finance, food, environment), large-scale land investments raised concerns about their negative impacts on local populations. To counter risks to agribusiness' reputation, sustainability certifications legitimize investments fulfilling certain production criteria. But do such certifications ensure local populations' land access? This paper investigates the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and argues that its definition of sustainability fails to ensure such land access for two reasons: (1) It refers to land rights instead of recognizing the human right to land (2) It promotes contract farming as win-win. By focusing on local contexts and practices in Colombia, field research provides evidence that to ensure local populations' land access, the RSPO should opt for a human rights approach. For the Colombian peace process, this result means that the RSPO's current definition of sustainability is not in line with the integral rural reform planned in the peace agreement.

TI What Do We (Not) Know About Development Aid and Violence? A Systematic
   Review
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The paper presents findings from the first-ever systematic review of the causal impact of development aid on violence in countries affected by civil war. The review identifies 19 studies: Fourteen within-country studies from Afghanistan, Iraq, Colombia, Philippines, and India, and five cross-national studies. These studies investigate the impact of six aid types: Community-driven development, conditional cash transfers, public employment scheme, humanitarian aid, infrastructure, and aid provided by military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan. The evidence for a violence-dampening effect of aid in conflict zones is not strong. Aid in conflict zones is more likely to exacerbate violence than to dampen violence. A violence-dampening effect of aid appears to be conditional on a relatively secure environment for aid projects to be implemented. A violence-increasing effect occurs when aid is misappropriated by violent actors, or when violent actors sabotage aid projects in order to disrupt the cooperation between the local population and the government.

TI Territorial politics and the success of collaborative environmental
   governance: local and regional partnerships compared
SO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The paper explores the role local governments and territorial proximity play in the efficiency of collaborative environmental governance. It develops the hypothesis that the representatives of local authorities involved in partnerships possess resources to diminish the pitfalls of sustainable governance, facilitate coordination, and contribute to the success of shared policy-making. Four French and English partnerships are presented. They include a diversity of stakeholders such as fisheries, ports, farmers, yachting associations, environmental NGOs, or local authorities. Thereby, the paper develops whether and under which conditions local governments play a positive or negative role, as well as comparing territorial levels of implementation and the effects of geographical proximity. It is shown that collaboration at the regional level prevents the integration of decision-making in organisational networks, the inclusion of citizens, and the development of social responsibility for stakeholders -the partnership acting as a formalisation of pre-existing lobbying. Locally, governments assume inter-organisational leadership and do contribute to the institutionalisation of the new forums. Yet, local successes of partnerships answer logics of social, rather than environmental, regulation. The local attenuation of usage conflicts does not necessarily reduce the negative effects of those usages on the environment. By stressing a collaborative definition of environmental problems, the partnerships tend to sideline substantial policy changes, and possibly conflict with the goals and longterm temporality of sustainable governance.

TI Using Negotiation Sites for Richer Collection of Network Data
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Global environmental governance (GEG) is widely recognized as particularly networked. And negotiation sites are sites not only of formal decision-making processes but also of intense networking by various actors. Use of formal social network analysis to analyze both networked governance and governance networks in global environmental politics has to date mostly rested on relatively easy-to-get data, such as membership in formal organizations or treaties. These analyses give useful broad-brush analyses to help think about the social structure of environmental governance, but relatively limited inferences can be drawn about key processes that network analysis can help understand, such as learning, diffusion, and other forms of institutional interaction. This article proposes how to advance the value of the method in the field by focusing on the personal networks of actors who make up the decision-making processes in GEG. Negotiation sites could thus become important sites for collection of data about these networks, through direct observation of interactions, intensive short interviews, and surveys, in particular.

TI Global justice and environmental governance: an analysis of the Paris
   Agreement
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL
AB Based on the major normative political theory contributions on global climate justice, the present paper analyzes the new international agreement on climate change, adopted at COP 21 in Paris (2015). Therefore, a literary review of the extensive normative theoretical discussion about global climate justice is made, with special attention to the two approaches that have permeated multilateral political negotiations - historical responsibility and equal per capita emissions. From this normative discussion, this paper recalls the global climate change negotiation process, focusing on the Kyoto Protocol. Next, the analysis emphasizes on the Paris Agreement in an effort to evaluate the normative questions on justice and equity within the environmental governance regime. Finally, the set of conclusions indicates that, although the flexibility of the Agreement has encompassed some dimensions of responsibility, necessity and ability to bear the costs, the most complex dimensions of justice and equity has not been completely solved, which may hinder the operation of environmental governance in a near future.

TI Natural resources governance and conflicts: Retrospective analysis
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Rapid increases in natural resources globally during the 1970s have had far-reaching environmental consequences. The rising exploitation of environmental assets has progressively detrimental societal effects. Therefore, the current study aims to identify the nexus between natural resources and governance conflicts while assessing the role of governance in natural resource management. The results identify three significant categories of governance challenges (associated with capacity, connectivity, and knowledge) and three domains of good governance (effectiveness, involvement, and efficiency). The results highlighted that developing countries would likely need more decision-making power, financial and human resources, leadership on crucial resource challenges, and conflict resolution mechanisms. On the contrary, research into natural resource management governance structures in industrialized countries has often shown problems with policy clarity and the alignment of stakeholder institutions' goals and aims. The study adds to the existing literature by summarizing new organizational capacities and governance frameworks essential for better natural resource management.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This article examines the relationship between interregional inequality and the incidence of domestic terrorism in a panel of 48 countries over the period 1990-2010. The results show that a high level of interregional inequality increases the number of domestic terror events in the sample countries. This finding is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables that may affect both interregional inequality and domestic terrorism. Furthermore, the observed link between interregional inequality and terrorist activity does not depend on the choice of the specific measure used to quantify the degree of dispersion in the regional distribution of GDP per capita within the sample countries.

TI The consequences of armed conflict on household composition
SO OXFORD DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB We evaluate the effect of large-scale violent conflict on the household composition of internally displaced persons using quantitative data from Colombia. We use a panel database of migrants constructed with the Sisben database (used to target social programmes in Colombia) for 2006-2009. We follow migrant mothers and children who belong to nuclear-biparental households before migration, and analyse the changes in the composition of their households after migration through multilevel multinomial logistic models. We do this separately for rural and urban migrants because they exhibit differences in household composition traditions and exposure to armed conflict. We find that urban and rural migrants have different migration strategies in both peaceful and armed conflict circumstances. We conclude that the household compositions of mothers and children are differently affected by violence, which might be caused by family separation; for example, rural children have a higher probability than mothers of belonging to households which are not nuclear biparental. We also find that exposure to violence can increase or decrease the effects of individual variables; for instance, in peaceful situations it is more likely that a household remains intact during migration when the number of children per adult increases; however, this effect is attenuated in violence situations.

CT Seminar on Sexuality, Gender and Rights - Exploring Theory and Practice
   in South and South East Asia
CY SEP, 2003
CL Bellagio, ITALY
AB The discourse of human rights in armed conflict situations is well adopted to respond to violence and violation, invoking internationally agreed principles of civil and political rights. However, in areas where the subject or domain of rights discourse is contested or controversial, human rights advocates appear less prepared to promote and defend such rights. Sexuality is one such domain. This paper explores the complex sexual choices women in Sri Lanka hove hod to negotiate, particularly widows and sex workers, within a context of ethnic conflict, militarisation and war It argues that sexuality cannot be defined exclusively in terms of violation, even in a context dominated by violence, and that the sexual ordering of society may be subverted in such conditions. Newly widowed women and sex workers have had to negotiate self-determination as well as take responsibility for earning income and heading households, in spite of contrary community pressures. For women, political and economic rights are closely linked with the ability to determine their sexual and reproductive choices. The challenge to women's and human rights advocates is how to articulate sexual autonomy as a necessary right on on a par with others, and strategise to secure this right during armed conflict and postwar reconstruction.

TI RECONCEPTUALISING THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO FOREIGN FIGHTERS
SO INTERNATIONAL & COMPARATIVE LAW QUARTERLY
AB The Syrian civil war has highlighted the phenomenon of foreign fighting, in which individuals leave their home State to join an armed conflict overseas. The predominant paradigm for regulating foreign fighting, centred on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2178, is based on counterterrorism, which in essence treats foreign fighting as a form of terrorism. This paradigm is largely reflective of the domestic legislation of the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and Australia. This article argues that this approach is problematic, and that an alternative paradigm based on the international law of neutrality and related domestic legislation provides a better means for regulating foreign fighting.

TI Toward Enabling and Inclusive Global Environmental Governance
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB Sustainable development has always been a compromise formulation that papered over real conflict between environment and development. Twenty years after Rio, the geopolitical climate is far less conducive to easy compromises. Given an embattled North and a rising South, particularly Asia, the language of zero sum conflict rather than positive sum cooperation is likely to prevail. Green growth offers one way to paper over these conflicts yet again, but it would be prudent to resist this temptation. There is incomplete buy-in to the green growth story, and some in the South are also concerned that this narrative will downgrade poverty alleviation and equity considerations from the sustainable development triad of environment, growth and distribution. In this context, Rio+20 can play a positive role by focusing on national and sub-national institutions and embracing a diversity of national political, institutional and legal contexts; seeking to impose uniformity is likely to chafe. Global efforts can play a supporting role by inducing normative change, stimulate national processes, and provide hooks for domestic policy actors. In addition, Rio+20 should ensure that inclusion of the weakest should remain firmly on the agenda. While the conversations may be difficult, Rio+20 will be most productive if it leads to engagement with fraught geopolitical issues than if, once again, these are papered over.

TI The Anti-Politics of Climate Finance: The Creation and Performativity of
   the Green Climate Fund
SO ANTIPODE
AB This paper is an empirical case study of the institutional design process of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from December 2011 to May 2014. Powerful countries, corporations and banks have favoured a deepening of neoliberal environmental governance, while civil society actors have argued over retaining movement concepts, won small representational victories, while participating in a process that has subjected them to a deepened practise of advanced liberal governance. The process has thus far produced non-outcomes that fail to meet hopes that the GCF could provide a significant scaling up and paradigm shift in global climate finance. However, civil society engagement appears to be, somewhat inadvertently, exposing the overflows, limits and contradictions inherent in advanced liberal governance. The impasse created has prompted alternative governmentalities to emerge, not least of spectacle and (non-)performativity, which may be generating an anti-politics in environmental governance.

TI Explaining Violent Intra-Ethnic Conflict: Group Fragmentation in the

SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Despite significant advances in the disaggregation of the study of civil conflict and intra-ethnic violence, intra-ethnic violence remains understudied. In this article, we present the first systematic, cross-national analysis of the conditions that promote violent, fragmentary conflict within politically active ethnic minorities. We propose a model of intra-ethnic conflict in which collective violence is produced by the interaction between subgroup entrepreneurs and the suppressive actions of the state. This two-level model predicts a curvilinear relationship between the relative size of an ethnic minority and its probability of experiencing large-scale intra-ethnic conflict. Additional hypotheses based on the proposed causal mechanism are also posited. These hypotheses are tested with data drawn from a global sample of politically active ethnic minorities, for the period 1990 through 2006, using a combination of parametric and semi-parametric regression techniques. The results strongly confirm the predicted curvilinear relationship while also demonstrating that the specific shape of this relationship shifts in predictable ways under varying social and political contexts.

TI Peace in Guatemala and Immigrant Health in the United States
SO ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background: The civil war between the indigenous Mayans and other Guatemalans lasted for 36 years, killed civilians, decimated villages, and resulted in many refugees. The Guatemalan Peace Agreement of 1996 aimed to alleviate the ongoing conflict. Studies of peace agreements more typically evaluate local political outcomes while neglecting global health outcomes.
   Objective: Our research quantified associations between pre-migration exposure to the peace agreement in Guatemala and the post-migration health status of Guatemalan immigrants in the United States.
   Methods: We used chi-square tests to compare the distribution of health status before and after peace. We used ordered probit regressions to estimate associations between peace in Guatemala and health in the United States, conditional on the observed distributions of age, age squared, age cubed, and linear time trends before and after peace.
   Findings: The study sample included 4,115 female and 5,282 male Guatemalan immigrants between the ages of 15 and 85. The mean age was 38.8 years for females (standard deviation, 14.2) and 35.4 years for males (standard deviation, 12.6). Chi-square tests found statistically significant differences in the distribution of health status before and after the peace agreement, for females (P < .001) and males (P < .001). In unadjusted results, the peace agreement was associated with a 7.3 percentage point increase in excellent post-migration health for females (95% confidence interval, 4.9 to 9.8) and a 6.0 percentage point increase for males (95% confidence interval, 3.8 to 8.2). In adjusted results, we found that the peace agreement was associated with a 6.1 percentage point increase in excellent post-migration health for females (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 11.4) and a 5.5-percentage point increase for males (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 10.0).
   Conclusions: The peace agreement in Guatemala was associated with statistically significant improvements in the health status of Guatemalan immigrants to the United States.

TI Fields of green: Corporate sustainability and the production of
   economistic environmental governance
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB This article critically examines the production of economistic fields of environmental governance in the context of global summits like Rio+20. It focuses on the constitutive work performed by diverse actors in extending corporate sustainability logics, social technologies, and organizational forms initially enacted at the 2012 Corporate Sustainability Forum (CSF). Fields are defined as dynamic, relational arenas featuring particular logics, dynamic actor positions, and organizational forms. Corporate sustainability exemplifies how the language and practices of economics have reshaped approaches to environmental protection and sustainable development. Although numerous studies have looked at the implementation of market-oriented approaches, less attention has been focused on the constitutive processes that animate and expand economistic fields of governance over time. Our analysis emphasizes diffuse processes of economization as central to the reproduction and extension of fields. The article addresses three key issues: (1) how global corporate sustainability networks help to constitute economistic fields of governance, (2) the extent to which major events contribute to field configuration, and (3) the processes through which field elementslogics, social technologies, and organizational formstranspose onto related fields of governance. Field configuration produces economistic environmental governance by solidifying business logics, enabling new actor-networks, launching new global-scale initiatives, and enhancing the role of UN agencies in promoting corporate sustainability. We illustrate field configuration with two examples: the Natural Capital Declaration and the Green Industry Platform. Our analysis highlights the diffuse power of field dynamics in which discursive and social entanglement and transposition reproduce and extend corporate sustainability beyond current institutional boundaries.

TI Environmental governance and social learning: towards more reflexive
   interactions
SO DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB Facing the increasing complexity of social and environmental issues, environmental governance configurations are required to adopt increasingly collaborative strategies and reflexive learning oriented practices. The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical discussion about environmental governance and the contribution of the social learning approach to expand the reflexivity potential of multi-stakeholder interaction spaces in governance processes. We argue that social learning practices, understood as interactive and reflective, can broaden the critical responsiveness of participating in environmental governance systems. Social learning-oriented processes are based on the promotion of dialogic spaces in which participants can learn from the diverse views present in the group and critically reflect on the assumptions that underlie decision making, thus creating possibilities for the emergence of innovative practices and new social configurations. We conclude that social learning processes driven by the stakeholders interactions in environmental governance spaces tend to broaden the ability of participants to critically evaluate the governance structure itself, in order to foster arrangements that can effectively promote practices for sustainability.

TI Was the EU's Role in Conflict Management in Macedonia a Success?
SO ETHNOPOLITICS
AB This article explores the EU's role in ethnic conflict management in Macedonia-once a favourite success story, now a case whose outcome appears increasingly uncertain. Through a historic and conceptual overview of the relations between EU/EEC and the Republic of Macedonia, this study analyses whether the EU's intervention can be considered a success. The paper examines the impact of the EU during the pre-conflict period, in the armed conflict in 2001 itself, in shaping the mediation effort leading to the Ohrid Framework Agreement, and in the management of the post-conflict phase. The EU's role as a power broker in de-escalating the armed conflict in 2001 and in securing the Ohrid Agreement occurred, it is argued, because of the EU's promotion of a perception that Macedonia had a clear perspective for EU membership. The prolonged stalemate in the accession process between Macedonia and the EU since the agreement has induced widespread scepticism about the credibility of the EU's incentives for compliance and the good faith of the EU as a conflict manager, thus threatening to destabilize Ohrid.

Based on the analysis model of the outcome set (Sustainable Development Goal Index) and the causal sets of seven variables on the four green state categories ('ecological authoritarian state', 'ecological modern state', 'ecological democracy state', and 'ecological welfare state'), this study reveals the following results. Among OECD member countries, if ones have high environmental tax, high environmental innovation (patent), high economic development and democracy, high levels of environmental governance and social expenditure, or have high economic development and democracy, and high levels of environmental governance and environmental health, they can be seen to have reached a high level of green state (consistency: 0.980, total coverage: 0.675). Also, the thirteen ideal types of green state of twenty-four OECD countries were derived. Norway (fuzzy-set membership score of 0.515) is a country of Type 1, with a characteristic of 'strong green state' having all high features of the four green state categories. Greece (membership score, 0.692) and Ireland (0.577) belong to Type 13, characterized by 'weak green state' with all four low features. As a result, the green state types of the twenty-four OECD countries can be assorted into five levels: 'Strong Green State', 'Quasi-Strong Green State', 'Quasi-Green State', 'Quasi-Weak Green State', and 'Weak Green State'.

TI Empirical Investigation into the Determinants of Terrorism: Evidence
   from Fragile States
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB This study investigates the determinants of terrorism in countries that are in the top category of the Fragile States Index (FSI), and are also prone to terrorism. Panel data for 38 countries mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia for the years 2005-2014 are used. Findings from the negative binomial and fixed effects estimation show that fragile state, number of refugees and youth unemployment have positive and significant impacts on terrorism. Military spending is positive but less robust across models. Conversely, FDI and remittances have a negative impact on terrorism with the former less robust. Governance and foreign aid are negative and insignificantly related to terrorism. Policy implications follow from the findings.

Author defines the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a civil war based on the scientific definition and categorization. Later on, the author points to the differences in perception of the war origins based on ethnicity, as Serbs perceive war as a civil war, Bosniaks as an external aggression of both Serbia and Croatia, while Croats perceive it as an external aggression of Serbia. Finally, the author suggests that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be perceived as an intercommunal ethnic conflict and internationalized civil war.

SO CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
AB This paper reviews recent literature on the mental health needs of youth in the context of war and terrorism. A human rights lens is used to explore issues of accessibility and sustainability in service utilization during times of crisis. The authors present the evolution of services over the last several decades, progressing through individual, school-based, and community-wide interventions by exploring models that focus on symptom reduction and building resilience. This paper highlights the benefits and limitations of traditional intervention methods and proposes a new frontier of intervention development and research. The authors focus on the emerging field of e-mental health services and specifically highlight the utility of virtual reality games in treating trauma-exposed youth. The rapid and easily accessible nature of e-mental health models is presented as one potential solution to barriers in accessibility that can help promote the human rights of youth exposed to war and terrorism.

TI Why did governance and institutional establishments fail in Sudan and
   South Sudan?
SO JOURNAL OF NORTH AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Since its independence in 1956, Sudan has continued its search for an inclusive and sustainable system that will address the sociopolitical and economic needs of its diverse ethno-cultural and religious population. The post-independence political elites have adopted colonials' traditions of political violence, subjective sociopolitical contracts and inequitable means of wealth distribution that only serve interests of the rulers. Consequently, the people of Sudan have lived through two bloody civil wars (1955-2005) that ended with the signing of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and separation of South Sudan in 2011. The separation of South Sudan did not, however, lead to good governance, political stability, or economic and institutional development. The neo-SPLA/M political establishment has failed to initiate the process of nation-building and socioeconomic and political reforms that would return political power to the people. The military elites in both countries continue to undermine the endless quest for sustainable, equitable and inclusive social, economic, and political participation. The two nations continue to endure challenges posed by decades of violence tainted with unresolved ethnic and regional grievances and identity politics. Thus, lack of political will for conflict resolution, transformation to democracy and equitable power sharing has delayed all aspects of sustainable economic development, thereby fuelling everlasting political violence.

TI Immediate physical needs of refugees during the Ukrainian armed conflict
   of 2022
SO HEALTH POLICY
AB Purpose: The study assessed the physical needs of Ukrainian refugees and internally displaced persons during the ongoing Ukrainian armed conflict of 2022. We aimed to investigate the immediate physical needs of the refugees that may affect their somatic condition during the armed conflict when they did not yet reach their final destination or just reached a safety zone.
   Methods: The questionnaire-based prospective repeated cross-sectional study (three study groups) and the longitudinal study (one group) were undertaken in Ukraine and Israel among 19,101 refugees and 828 controls from February 24 to April 9. We assessed the availability of basic somatic necessities (water, food, clothing, hygiene, and sleep) and the general physical fatigue of internal, moving abroad, and arriving to safety refugees with scores ranging from 35 (normal) to 7 (extremely inadequate).
   Results: The average score of 26.8 +/- 1.8 indicates that the participants experienced somatic problems even being healthy. In Ukraine, the score for moving abroad refugees (n = 16,449) dropped from 26.8 +/- 0.6 to 23.5 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.03) during the study period. Internally displaced persons (n = 1200) remained physically stable with a score of 27.5 +/- 0.7. In Israel, group-organized refugees (n = 796) were relatively normal somatically (30.0 +/- 0.6) while independent refugees (n = 656) were exhausted having a score of 24.2 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.03 vs. group-organized).
   Conclusion: During hostilities, refugees, internally displaced persons, and regular inhabitants are somatically affected but to varying degrees. For refugees, group-organized travel abroad is the best option to maintain adequate physical condition, followed by an internal refugee status, and travel abroad independently (the worst strategy).

SO MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB The article represents the results of analytical review and comparative analysis of EU membership candidate countries legal economic framework for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. The aim of the research is to show opportunities and illuminate the gaps for timely fulfillment of obligation in framework of euro integration process. The choice of countries is determined by similarity of political, economic, and social conditions including, inter alia: 1) the aftermath of the global economic crisis; 2) political crisis; 3) threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the risk of armed conflict (the unlawful annexation of the Crimea and Sevastopol and destabilization in the Eastern Ukraine; occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia; and the Transnistria conflict in Moldova). The comparative analysis determined some similarities in positive shifts for all countries. In the article is underlined that first steps to be taken as a matter of priority toward implementing the sustainable development and green economy objectives should include the development of the Governmental Action Plan to support transition toward a green growth model; establishment of the governmental coordination and information centre; adoption of a unified system of sustainable development and green growth indicators; development and introduction of a smart system of economic incentives including tax exemptions, no-interest or low-interest loans for businesses introducing resource-saving technologies and environmental protection facilities (wastewater treatment facilities, waste recycling plants etc.); legislation of mechanisms facilitating the involvement of the public in resource management and decision-making.

TI The public sector corruption and organised crime nexus: The case of the
   fertiliser subsidy programme in Malawi
SO AFRICAN SECURITY REVIEW
AB The nexus between corruption and organised crime is under-established. This article argues, however, that there is a direct linkage between corruption and organised crime. By using the case study of a Malawi fertiliser subsidy programme the article shows that corruption not only gives rise to organised criminal groups, but also works as a lubricant for the effective operation and survival of organised criminal groups. The fertiliser subsidy programme implemented by Malawi in the 2005-2009 growing seasons has generally been heralded as a success as a result of the resultant abundant yields. Donor organisations that were initially not in support of the programme as it was in conflict with their neoliberal policy ideals subsequently began funding it. However, the programme was rocked by corruption which has given rise to organised criminal groups who have hijacked the whole process and either smuggled the subsidised fertiliser to other countries or took it for their personal use. The problem has been exacerbated by the international dimensions of the crime and the fact that traditional leaders, politicians and government officials have been key players in the process, thereby intensifying the corruption/organised crime nexus. This in turn has had a negative effect on the poor who were supposed to be the primary beneficiaries of the programme.

TI Inclusion of persons with disabilities in the Colombian peace agreements
SO IBEROAMERICAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB There is a noteworthy relationship between disability and armed conflict. The critical situations of violence, besides causing new-fangled disabilities, may intensify the existing ones. Taking into consideration that the term "disability" is a human rights issue as well as the high quantity of victims of the conflict who in fact have any sort of disability, it could have been significant that the Colombian peace agreement with FARC-EP has encompassed a specific disability approach. Therefore, the absence of this perspective may perpetuate its exclusion. Throughout the current negotiation process with ELN, an opportunity is opened to mend this omission.

TI Estimating the effects of Syrian civil war
SO EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB We estimate the effects of the Syrian civil war using a synthetic control method which is based on a counterfactual scenario of an absence of the armed conflict that has led to the humanitarian crisis and one of the largest population displacements without a precedent in modern history. By comparing Syria's growth and development trajectories with the characteristics of a set of sixty-six countries with no armed internal conflict between 1996 and 2021, we can deduce a series of gaps in economic growth, human development, and institutional quality that can be attributed to the civil war. Our analysis shows that the effect of the Syrian civil war on the trajectory of economic growth was temporary and almost disappeared before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, the war led to an unprecedented decline in human development, a high rise in infant mortality, and a prevalent degradation of institutional quality. To the present day, the civil war has led to more than 4500 additional infant deaths with a permanently derailed trajectory of longevity. The unparalleled and permanent deterioration in institutional quality resulting from the war is indicated by a diminished rule of law, civil liberties, government efficiency, and a widespread escalation of corruption. To ensure the internal validity of the findings, the estimated effects were subjected to and passed a variety of placebo checks.

TI Peace Resources? Governing Liberia's Forests in the Aftermath of
   Conflict
SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
AB Natural resources represent both peril and promise for peacebuilding. Natural resources can support economic recovery and sustainable livelihoods, and contribute to trust and cooperation frequently lacking in war-torn societies. Natural resources can also catalyse social disputes and provide revenue for would-be insurgents. Recognition that natural resources can be an opportunity and challenge for peace has led international peacebuilders to intervene in post-conflict countries to establish governance reforms that promote sustainable peace and development. This article examines international efforts to govern natural resources in the aftermath of conflict. Specifically, it focuses on Liberia, where timber was recognized as a key factor in fuelling the decade-long civil war; and as a result, forest reform was a peacebuilding priority. I argue that although there have been some positive results, the forest reform process has been controversial in part due to international interventions that mirror pre-war forest governance arrangements in which patronage and corruption historically took root and work to rekindle past sources of tension. I suggest that international peacebuilders should not see themselves as interveners but conveners that use natural resource governance as a way to build confidence and serve as a foundation for cooperation and peace.

TI Framing health and foreign policy: lessons for global health diplomacy
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Global health financing has increased dramatically in recent years, indicative of a rise in health as a foreign policy issue. Several governments have issued specific foreign policy statements on global health and a new term, global health diplomacy, has been coined to describe the processes by which state and non-state actors engage to position health issues more prominently in foreign policy decision-making. Their ability to do so is important to advancing international cooperation in health. In this paper we review the arguments for health in foreign policy that inform global health diplomacy. These are organized into six policy frames: security, development, global public goods, trade, human rights and ethical/moral reasoning. Each of these frames has implications for how global health as a foreign policy issue is conceptualized. Differing arguments within and between these policy frames, while overlapping, can also be contradictory. This raises an important question about which arguments prevail in actual state decision-making. This question is addressed through an analysis of policy or policy-related documents and academic literature pertinent to each policy framing with some assessment of policy practice. The reference point for this analysis is the explicit goal of improving global health equity. This goal has increasing national traction within national public health discourse and decision-making and, through the Millennium Development Goals and other multilateral reports and declarations, is entering global health policy discussion. Initial findings support conventional international relations theory that most states, even when committed to health as a foreign policy goal, still make decisions primarily on the basis of the 'high politics' of national security and economic material interests. Development, human rights and ethical/moral arguments for global health assistance, the traditional 'low politics' of foreign policy, are present in discourse but do not appear to dominate practice. While political momentum for health as a foreign policy goal persists, the framing of this goal remains a contested issue. The analysis offered in this article may prove helpful to those engaged in global health diplomacy or in efforts to have global governance across a range of sectoral interests pay more attention to health equity impacts.

TI Public Perceptions on Organised Crime, Mafia, and Terrorism: A Big Data
   Analysis based on Twitter and Google Trends
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER CRIMINOLOGY
AB Public perceptions enable crime and motivate government policy on law and order; however, there has been limited empirical research on serious crime perceptions in social media. Recently, open source data-and 'big data'-have enabled researchers from different fields to develop cost-effective methods for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to apply state-of-the-art tools and techniques for assembly and analysis of open source data. We set out to explore how non-discursive behavioural data can be used as a proxy for studying public perceptions of serious crime. The data collection focused on the following three conversational topics: organised crime, the mafia, and terrorism. Specifically, time series data of users' online search habits (over a ten-year period) were gathered from Google Trends, and cross-sectional network data (N=178,513) were collected from Twitter. The collected data contained a significant amount of structure. Marked similarities and differences in people's habits and perceptions were observable, and these were recorded. The results indicated that 'big data' is a cost-effective method for exploring theoretical and empirical issues vis-a-vis public perceptions of serious crime.

TI Low Carbon Urban Transitioning in Shenzhen: A Multi-Level Environmental
   Governance Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As the world's second largest economy, China ranks among the world's top nations when it comes to carbon emission. Accordingly, its attitude towards climate change is closely followed by all parties concerned. There have been few studies on the role of environmental governance in the transformation process to low-carbon, especially Chinese ones. This study analyzes the impact of government environmental regulation on the low-carbon city transformation process by adopting Shenzhen as the research object. One of the world's youngest super cities, Shenzhen also happens to be the city with the lowest carbon emission intensity in China. The multi-level governance framework is a useful mechanism with which to gauge divisions of responsibility and resources. This paper uses multilevel environmental governance to explain the policy for dealing with the climate in the city of Shenzhen. Striving to explore green low-carbon development path for the whole country, Shenzhen provides practical experience for countries to cope with global climate change.

   Escalate Violence to Higher-Intensity Armed Conflicts?
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
AB Why do some insurgent groups escalate violence to higher-intensity insurgencies or civil war? We explore this question among 140 insurgent groups worldwide across various thresholds of armed conflict. We argue that the main drivers of escalation are insurgent networks and domestic resource mobilization. Findings show that territorial control and engagement in criminal activities to finance operations are key factors associated with insurgent-inflicted battle deaths. The number of insurgent alliances, however, is the strongest determinant of higher-intensity armed conflicts. State counterinsurgency strategies also play an important role. Many of these insights support an exploratory look at rising insurgent violence in West Africa's Sahel region.

TI Foreign Aid Shocks as a Cause of Violent Armed Conflict
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB In this study we resolve part of the confusion over how foreign aid affects armed conflict. We argue that aid shocks-severe decreases in aid revenues-inadvertently shift the domestic balance of power and potentially induce violence. During aid shocks, potential rebels gain bargaining strength vis-a-vis the government. To appease the rebels, the government must promise future resource transfers, but the government has no incentive to continue its promised transfers if the aid shock proves to be temporary. With the government unable to credibly commit to future resource transfers, violence breaks out. Using AidData's comprehensive dataset of bilateral and multilateral aid from 1981 to 2005, we evaluate the effects of foreign aid on violent armed conflict. In addition to rare-event logit analysis, we employ matching methods to account for the possibility that aid donors anticipate conflict. The results show that negative aid shocks significantly increase the probability of armed conflict onset.

AB Existing research has found that killing or capturing rebel group leaders can lead to the termination of civil wars. This paper considers the quality of those terminations, examining how wars end and whether this produces a lasting peace or only a temporary reprieve from violence. Decapitation is expected to weaken rebel groups, shifting the balance of power to the government; however, results suggest that killing or capturing a rebel group leader tends to produce termination through inactivity rather than outright government victories. Decapitation is also found to have no effect on the chances of civil war recurrence. This suggests that the removal of rebel group leaders is effective primarily as a short-term strategy that does not tend to generate a lasting peace.

TI Economic Costs of Civil Conflicts: The Case of Burundi
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB This study examines the effects of civil conflicts in Burundi on its economic performance. The analysis of the structural effects using a structural VAR model points to the long-lasting effects of a civil conflict shock on economic growth in Burundi. After 10 years, the effect on economic growth is still noticeable. The cumulative effect of a civil conflict shock is found to be a 7.1% decrease in economic growth over a horizon of 10 years. Using the Synthetic Control method, estimates indicate that the Burundian civil war led to an average GDP per capita decline of approximately 138 dollars per annum, compared to what it would have been in the absence of war. The average annual loss as a percentage of the counterfactual GDP per capita is 34%. The total monetary cost of the war during this period is estimated at USD 1514 per person and almost 10 billion USD for the entire country. The estimated effects are robust to placebo checks conducted. We compare these results with costs of conflict in other countries to better understand the relative financial burden of the civil war. The study highlights the need to consolidate peace to achieve long-term economic development in Burundi.

TI Do child soldiers influence UN Peacekeeping?
SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
AB The use of child soldiers in conflicts has received increasing academic attention in recent years. This article examines post-conflict periods to see whether the use of child soldiers mobilizes United Nations peacekeeping operations (UN PKO) in the aftermath of a conflict. Taking into consideration how child soldiers affect conflict and how important their reintegration is to sustainable peace and post-conflict development, we analyse whether the presence of child soldiers in a civil war increases the likelihood of the presence of a PKO. We argue that the UN deems a conflict with child soldiers as a difficult case for conflict resolution, necessitating a response from the international community. This is in line with our empirical results confirming that the use of child soldiers significantly increases the likelihood of peacekeeping.

TI Disputes over the Divine: Introducing the Religion and Armed Conflict
   (RELAC) Data, 1975 to 2015
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB This article introduces the Religion and Armed Conflict (RELAC) data, 1975 to 2015, which is a new data set suitable for analyzing the causes, dynamics, and resolution of religious conflicts. It contains information about key religious dimensions of conflicts: whether the issue at stake is religious, the actors' religious identity, and fine-grained data about the type and salience of religious claims. The article presents the major features of the data set and describes patterns and trends that shed new light on religious conflicts, for example, by demonstrating that conflicts over Islamist claims have become more prevalent. We also illustrate the utility of the data. For instance, we show that there is great variation in lethality across conflicts with different types of Islamist claims, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of the deadliness of religious conflicts. RELAC should be a valuable resource for scholars, examining religious dimensions of intrastate armed conflicts.

TI Foreign aid and political stability
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Concerns about international terrorism make the stability of failing states central to Western foreign aid policies. This paper explores how donors reduce the volatility of aid to avoid political destabilization of recipient countries. Using a formal model, we show that stability-oriented donors control the risk of conflict, but they never fully eliminate it. Recipient governments can exploit donor preferences for stability through increased rent extraction. As a result, stability-oriented aid reduces the risk of political destabilization only under narrow circumstances. If these conditions are not met, stability aid makes conflict more likely. We present evidence for key predictions of our model.

TI Back Home Again: Assessing the Impact of Provisions for Internally
   Displaced Persons in Comprehensive Peace Accords
SO REFUGEE SURVEY QUARTERLY
AB This article examines how issues related to internally displaced persons are integrated into comprehensive peace accords. The question being asked is twofold: Does the inclusion of internally displaced persons issues increase the likelihood for a peace accord's success? Does the inclusion of internally displaced persons issues into a peace accord increase the likelihood that these issues will be resolved? Using data from the Peace Accord Matrix, this research finds that the inclusion of internally displaced persons issues within an accord does indeed increase its likelihood for success. However, there is less evidence to suggest that the inclusion of such provisions actually leads to the successful resolution of internally displaced persons issues. The article further investigates this issue by examining cases in which a country has pursued internally displaced persons legislation prior to the signing of the final peace accord and finds evidence to suggest that when internally displaced persons issues are addressed outside the parameters of the peace negotiation there is a higher likelihood for success. The implications of these findings are discussed.

It centres on thorough analysis of the case of Desio (Milan, Italy), where a recent judicial inquiry discovered several instances of corruption related to the drafting of the local master plan, in an environment characterised by the rooted presence of a mafia-type organisation known as the 'Ndrangheta. The study sheds light on the various types of corrupt practices that prevail in the field of urban planning, the main issues at stake, and the key public agents involved. General hypotheses about the main internal and external factors fostering corruption in the planning domain are presented and discussed.

SO ESSAYS ON LAW AND WAR AT THE FAULT LINES
AB During the First Gulf War of 1990-1991, Iraqi forces engaged in activities, including dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and igniting Kuwaiti oil wells, which drew global attention to the environmental consequences of warfare. This chapter identifies and assesses the international legal regime governing the environmental impact of armed conflict. It begins with an examination of the historical record of environmental damage during warfare. The prescriptive norms-including peacetime, customary and treaty prescriptions-governing such damage are next catalogued and analyzed. Concluding that the existing law fails to adequately address environmental consequences that result from hostilities, the author suggests how the international community should respond to its shortcomings.

TI Between War and Peace: Intermittent Armed Conflict and Investment
   Arbitration
SO INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT
SE European Yearbook of International Economic Law
AB During periods of armed conflict, a State's treaty commitments may be suspended or replaced by other international legal obligations, often relating to international humanitarian law, the laws of war or international human rights law. However, international investment agreements (IIAs) may be distinct in this respect. A State's ability to derogate from its IIA obligations during periods of armed conflict is likely to be extremely limited or impossible; many IIAs explicitly provide protections to foreign investors in times of armed conflict or war. What is less clear is how the incidence of armed conflict within the territory of a State subject to an investment treaty dispute is to be resolved by an arbitral tribunal when the armed conflict is not-and possibly cannot be-clearly defined; or where there are cycles of war and peace within short periods of time and relating to the same general situation. We address this question in the context of the Libyan Civil War, considering the most relevant standards of protection included in IIAs concluded by Libya, as well as the most likely defences which Libya may invoke to preclude wrongfulness for possible breaches of its IIA obligations.

TI Citizens in Peace Processes
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Citizen engagement in and support for peace processes have been deemed important for sustainable peace after civil wars. Yet much of what we know about peace processes in civil wars centers on the interests of elite actors. This special feature aims to advance a research agenda focusing on citizens in peace processes to address this mismatch. In the introduction to the special feature, we first present empirical evidence situating citizens in relation to civil war peace processes. We then trace the current state of the literature on the roles of citizens in peace processes. Following that, we introduce a conceptual framework designed to improve scholarly analysis of the political behavior of citizens in peace processes. We also locate the individual contributions to the special feature within the framework in order to demonstrate its utility and as a means of helping to identify directions for future research.

TI Corruption, Terrorism and the Stock Market: The Evidence from Iraq
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB The current study explains how corruption, terrorism, political stability and oil price has an effect on on the Iraq stock exchange utilizing corruption perception index as a proxy of corruption, global terrorism index as proxy for terrorism, political stability and oil price with ISX60 index as proxy of stock market for the period (2005-2019) using Ordinary Least Square method. The results show that the level of corruption, terrorism activities and political stability coefficient is significantly positive with Iraq stock exchange. In contrast, the oil price coefficient is significantly negative with Iraq stock exchange, which means that lower levels of corruption, less terrorism activities and more stability in political system have strong influence on stock market development in Iraq. The study concludes that the explanatory variables are important for Iraq stock exchange. Hence, the study suggests the policy makers to develop stock market by implementing policies and strategies to overcome high level of corruption, terrorism activities especially after ISIS/ISIL announcement has been made public. There is a need for transparency and creating stable political environment through good governance practices in order to attract more foreign investment and promote economic development. Factors like terrorism and corruption make economic and political systems unstable and has an adverse effect on on Iraq's stock exchange performance.

TI THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR AND THE ACHILLES' HEEL OF THE LAW OF
   NON-INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICT
SO STANFORD JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB The insistence of the Assad regime on treating members of non-State armed groups as terrorists that may receive grave sentences, and even the death penalty, upon capture may go some way in explaining the endemic disregard for the laws of war by all parties in the Syrian Civil War. It is broadly recognized that the threat of the death penalty for mere participation in hostilities greatly reduces the incentives for rebel groups to comply with the law of armed conflict. The central thesis of the present contribution is that, under certain conditions, non-State armed groups must be granted combatant-like status without this being conditioned on the ad hoc consent of the de jure government. Clearly this position raises a host of questions, several of which were also raised during the 1949 Geneva Conference. If they were ultimately left unanswered at that time, the excesses of recent conflicts, such as that in Syria, stand as proof that the time is ripe to revisit the matter.

The study of intervention has focused primarily on the conflict characteristics and dyadic linkages that make intervention more likely, or the conflict outcomes that interventions generate, while holding all else equal. To paint a more complete picture of what goes into the intervention decision, I advocate a shift in the way we conceive of interventions toward network analysis, which grants due agency to the multiple external actors and internal combatants that influence the decision to intervene. This review critically examines and synthesizes the recent literature on third-party interventions in civil conflict and, in so doing, identifies some areas for future research.

The research uses policy transfer theory to investigate the practicality and effectiveness of EU-led environmental initiatives when implemented at state and local levels. The study reveals a disconnect between these initiatives and their execution, with corruption and fragile political arrangements identified as significant barriers to environmental protection. The research further underscores the complex nature of EU-driven environmental governance policies and the impact of post-war political agreements and transitional struggles on Bosnia and Herzegovina's and Croatia's governance structures. The methodology involves a detailed analysis of the legal frameworks, policies, and plans employed by the EU and the countries under study. The results highlight the importance of context and capacity in evaluating the effectiveness of environmental governance. The study contributes to understanding environmental governance in the EU context and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for policy transfer to state-level governments.

AB This study examined the context of organised crime groups that traffic in people for the Australian sex industry. It is a qualitative study of twenty-one cases of human trafficking. The study found that criminal networks preyed on vulnerable females from countries such as Thailand, South Korea, and China. Victims were deceptively recruited with the cost of their travel to Australia held against them as a highly inflated debt. As a result, they find themselves forced into sex work to repay the debt. This study examined the attributes of the organised crime syndicates involved in the people trafficking and discussed the context in which they operate in Australia. The study used the Sleipnir framework to analyse organised crime groups and it is recommended that the Sleipnir model is integrated into future law enforcement activities in respect of human trafficking. The introduction of a standardised data and statistical collection tool in respect of human trafficking would provide law enforcement and intelligence agencies with a conceptual framework and a greater comprehensive description of human trafficking.

TI Climate change in the Horn of Africa: causations for violent extremism
SO BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION
AB Scientific evidence suggests our planet is experiencing climatic changes: increases in regional temperatures, variations in seasonal precipitation, stronger storms, sea level rise, and decreases in water availability. Consequently, these climatic changes have resulted in elevated rates of human migration, food insecurities, increased socioeconomic inequalities, civil conflict, and acts of terrorism. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of climate change and its relationship to reported acts of terrorism in Somalia. Using a negative binomial regression model, various variables related to climate change were evaluated from 1991 to 2019. This study identified that annual increases in charcoal production, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil consumption were associated with reported terrorism attacks. Additionally, annual decreases in mean precipitation were also shown to be related to acts of terrorism. Controlling for the gross domestic product growth rate, the population growth rate, and state weakness, this study also determined that annual decreases in state weakness as well as the gross domestic product growth rate were also associated with reported terrorism incidents. Policy implications will be discussed.

TI Group inequality and the severity of civil conflict
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
AB Civil conflicts, which have been much more prevalent than inter-state conflicts over the last fifty years, vary enormously in their intensity, with some causing millions of deaths and some far fewer. The central goal of this paper is to test an argument from previous theoretical research that high inequality within an ethnic group can make inter-ethnic conflict more violent because such inequality decreases the opportunity cost to poor group members of fighting, and also decreases the opportunity cost to rich group members of funding the conflict. To test this argument, we create a new data set that uses individual-level surveys to measure inequality within ethnic groups. The analysis using these data provide strong evidence for the importance of within-group inequality, and thus underscores the value of focusing on the capacity of groups to fight if one wishes to limit the destruction of civil conflicts.

First, the unconditional impact of total natural resources per capita on terrorism is negative and consistently significant across the model specifications. Second, the unconditional influence of environment (measured with carbon emissions) on terrorism is positive across the specifications. Third, the marginal effect of interactions between total natural resources per capita and environment is steadily negative for both domestic and unclear terrorism but positive for transnational terrorism. Four, the magnifying impacts of other confounders such as the lagged value of terrorism, surface areas, physical integrity rights and population are in tandem with expected priors. What is more, the empirical findings regarding the negative impact of total natural resources per capita however, diverge for the natural resource rents-a measure of natural resource dependence. Thus, maintaining a credible, sustainable and inclusive governance of natural resources constitute a formidable bulwark to fighting terrorism.

TI On integrated environmental governance in the Netherlands: a comparative
   study in reforms for South Africa
SO COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICA-CILSA
AB Environmental governance is an essential facet of the entire environmental law effort in South Africa. Fragmentation of the environmental governance regime is however a concern in the country. Fragmentation is patent in the various structures and institutions, environmental Acts and authorisation processes. This leads to unsustainable and ineffective governance. Similarly, the Netherlands experienced fragmentation of its environmental governance regime with various challenges essentially resembling those of South Africa. Various integration reforms were initiated in the Netherlands by way of the National Environmental Management Act, 1993. This Act is based on the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, 1996, of the European Union which provides a broad framework for a more integrated environmental governance effort by establishing integrated authorities and other institutions, integrated procedures, integrated legislation, and by utilising various other innovative mechanisms to achieve more streamlined and sustainable governance. This article distils a number of these integration mechanisms from the European approach and suggests that these integration reforms should be implemented as a matter of urgency to achieve a more sustainable environmental governance effort at domestic level.

TI Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB International organizations (IOs) take on an increasing share of civil war mediation around the world. The determinants of IO mediation effectiveness remain poorly understood, partly because prior research has not adequately captured the institutional heterogeneity of peace-brokering IOs. To explore how mediation effectiveness depends on institutional variation, I combine newly gathered data on the design of 13 peace-brokering IOs with existing data on 109 civil war mediation episodes in the 1975-2004 period. I find that IOs with institutionalized capabilities to deploy field missions, such as peacekeeping operations, outperform other IOs as mediators of civil wars, whereas information-gathering capacity does not yield a significant advantage. The results suggest that IO enforcement assistance has a forward-looking effect: the ability to credibly signal, ex ante, that peacekeeping or monitoring forces will be deployed to enforce an agreement, helps IOs shape negotiations long before forces are actually deployed. Reaffirming the credible commitment theory of conflict resolution, the study demonstrates that there is considerable variation among external guarantors, which explains why some IOs can shift civil war disputants away from violent bargaining strategies whereas other cannot.

TI Choices of Justice: Effects of Civil War Termination on Postconflict
   Justice Mechanisms Implemented by the State
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
AB In the immediate aftermath of intrastate conflict, states utilize justice mechanisms to address past abuses and to move towards the construction of sustainable peace. However, despite the recognition that justice mechanisms may help facilitate the reconstruction of postconflict states, variance exists regarding which mechanisms states choose to implement. The diversity in choices of justice mechanisms following intrastate conflict raises a central question: under what conditions do states choose retributive and/or restorative postconflict justice mechanisms (PCJMs)? Using multinomial logistic regression, we draw upon existing strands of the civil war termination literature, including dual sovereignty, 'spoilers' and third-party intervention, to model PCJM implementation. We find evidence that the form of civil war termination and the presence of a UN intervention are strongly correlated with the quantity and type of justice mechanisms employed.

TI Deconstructing civil wars: Beyond the new wars debate
SO SECURITY DIALOGUE
AB The identification of intra-national armed conflict as a leading problem for the international community in the 1990s produced a wave of novel research into civil wars. Though these new civil war studies soon began to claim a degree of consensus on several key questions, the very concept and ontology of civil war has been implicitly and explicitly contested. An examination of the politics of naming civil wars likewise reveals the extent to which varying and sometimes conflicting definitions of civil war are still in circulation among various observer types. Instead of adjudicating these disputed definitions of civil war, this article details the way in which particular conceptions of civil war produce their object of analysis. The recent Algerian conflict stands as an excellent case study in the politics of naming civil wars and the ways in which the conceptual frameworks of the new civil war studies make Algeria into a civil war. To go beyond the contested definition of civil war, the new civil war studies should not judge the viability of concepts of mass armed violence - whether civil war or so-called new wars - on their alleged coherence with particular representations of history. Concepts of mass violence should instead be judged in relation to the political goals from which they obtain their warrant in the first place.

TI Inclusive recycling movements: a green deep democracy from below
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
AB This paper examines the multiple strategies articulated by grassroots recycler networks to bring about socioenvironmental change. The paper shows how these networks are an emblematic case of grassroots governmentality, whereby urban poor communities contribute to building more inclusive environmental regimes by developing technologies of power more typical of the powerful. These technologies include enumeration, with its resulting self-knowledge; the production of discourses and rationalities of social inclusion and environmental sustainability; and engagement in open and diverse alliances, at times with actors holding apparently antagonistic interests. The paper also reveals how recycling networks are a representative case of deep and green democracy. It is deep democracy, as grassroots networks strive to gain deep and true representativeness in their territories. It is green democracy, as it illustrates alternative pathways to environmental governance that is not limited to state and global organizations, but that also includes a range of control techniques emanating from the communities themselves.

Emphasizing the impact of the UN's involvement, it argues that minorities are predisposed to hold a higher degree of confidence in the UN in countries where ethnic conflict has taken place and this difference is further complicated by the nature of the countries' political regimes. Utilizing the World Value Surveys for the period 1981-2012, we find robust evidence for our arguments. We also find that minorities probably increase in such trust as ethnic conflict persists longer.

TI Unpacking Peace and Order in Mindanao, Philippines Using a Peace
   Psychology Framework
SO PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY
AB This study examines the Peace and Order Council mechanisms in selected areas of Mindanao, Philippines using a peace psychology framework that integrates episodes and structures of violence and peace. Fifteen in-depth interviews among members of the Peace and Order Councils were conducted and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results show that direct violence in the study areas includes acts of terrorism and criminality, violence brought about by intergroup conflicts and insurgency, and violence done by and against the military and the police, while structural violence involves human rights violation, poverty, inadequate social services, and poor peacebuilding programs. To address direct violence, the Peace and Order Councils implement stricter security system, intensify their intelligence operations, execute martial law, and employ their traditional nonviolent means of managing intergroup conflicts. Their peacebuilding undertakings highlight their engagement in the Mindanao peace process, development endeavors, and inclusivity initiatives. Findings lend support to the potency of the peace psychology framework in elucidating peace and violence and contribute to the development of sustainable peacemaking and peacebuilding strategies.

TI The impact of forced migration on marital life in Chad
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE
AB Civil war in Chad in the 1990s had a major impact on the family life of large numbers of people who were internally displaced or sought refuge in exile. This article examines the effect of these forced migrations on marriage, in particular the transition from monogamy to divorce or bigamy. It analyses data collected in N'Djamena in 1993-1994. The higher risk of divorce among internally displaced persons compared to that of refugees suggests that they were more vulnerable from a demographic perspective, and that their marital survival strategies may have been less successful. It is suggested that aid agencies should increase assistance given to internally displaced people because they are more at risk.

TI Explaining divergent responses to ethnic exclusion: evidence from two
   paired comparisons
SO CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
AB This article asks why ethnic exclusion from executive-level state power leads to armed conflict in some cases but not in others. To answer this question the author develops a nine-factor model of ethnic conflict, which is used to investigate the diverging conflict trajectories of two pairs of 'most similar' ethnic groups. These include the Malinke in Guinea and Northerners in Cote d'Ivoire on the one hand, and Kurds in Syria and Turkey on the other. It is shown that varying responses to ethnic exclusion can mainly be traced back to three factors, which have so far been neglected in the ethnic conflict literature: the selectivity of state violence, the territorial reach of the state and the availability of cross-border sanctuaries. Ethnic rebellion occurs where weak territorial control and indiscriminate repression combine with external sanctuary. Conversely, violent escalation is avoided in a context of strong territorial control, selective repression and no external sanctuary.

Drawing on case studies conducted under the Forging Resilient Social Contracts project and building on the literature on transitions from war to peace and authoritarianism to democracy, the theoretical framework links inclusion to peace sustainability. Interrogating how and why processes of inclusion matter, we argue that resilient social contracting is driven by elite inclusion, societal inclusion and their interactions. Four case-studies illustrate the arguments. Resilient social contracting, findings suggest, allows countries to weather crises and survive to 'transition another day'.

Second, it contextualises the Mindanao conflict by focussing on its main actors; and third, the OIC's response as a third party through different types of conflict resolutions modalities in the historicity of the peace process will be explored in the analysis section. The conclusions will summarise a set of reasons why the OIC's response has overall been ad hoc, politically charged and ineffective in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the Mindanao conflict.

AB Previous quantitative research on ethnic civil war relies on macro-level proxies in an attempt to specify the conditions under which ethnic minorities rebel. Going beyond an exclusive focus on minorities, the present study employs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a way to model ethnic center-periphery dyads that confront governments with excluded groups. We construct and analyze a new dataset of geo-referenced politically relevant ethnic groups, covering the entire world during the period from 1951 through 2005. Our results show that the conflict probability of marginalized groups increases with the demographic power balance compared to the group(s) in power. Furthermore, the risk of conflict increases with the distance from the group to the capital, and the roughness of the terrain in the group's settlement area. We also find that while the results for demographic group strength hold for all ethnic civil wars, the geographic factors apply for territorial ethnic conflicts only.

TI Criminogenic risks of irregular migration in conditions of armed
   conflict in Ukraine
SO DIXI
AB The purpose of the paper is to comprehend and examine dimensions of irregular migration, namely its criminogenic and victimological sources, and its background influence on criminal processes in conditions of armed conflict in Ukraine. Results of the study allow us to draw a sound conclusion that irregular migration poses a number of criminogenic risks to Ukrainian national security, as well as to the rights and freedoms of Ukrainian citizens, especially of those who remain or arrive to the occupied territories. The research ascertains that criminogenic potential of migration may be viewed from two related perspectives associated with the phenomenon of migrants' criminality and migrants as potential or real victims of crime. The research outlines the factors providing a favourable environment for engaging irregular migrants into criminal activities. Based on the recent amendments to the Criminal Code of Ukraine and on current criminal statistics, the research ascertains the links of ethnic minority criminality and mercenary activities with irregular migration in Ukraine. The research provides arguments that internally displaced persons can be viewed as a contemporary type of intra-state migration that poses additional criminogenic hazards in the conditions of armed conflict in Ukraine. Practical implications of the study lay in the recommendations for decreasing the risks of irregular migration, in conditions of armed conflict in Ukraine, and defined the following: Resolving the issue on the legal status of the armed conflict in Eastern regions of Ukraine, as well as recognizing Lugansk Public Republic and Donetsk Public Republics as terrorist's organizations on the national level. Reinforcing suppression of all kinds of smuggling, including international. The same way, with the occupied territories, providing legal and psychological support to the victims of human trafficking and to the internally displaced persons; intensification of awareness-raising campaign on the risks on migrant smuggling and human trafficking among Ukrainian citizens, including the population of the affected conflict regions; reinforcing the fight against organized crime, and paying a specific attention at counteracting ethnic minority criminality. Finally, enhancing organizational bases and legal support in the field of counteracting irregular migration.

AB China suffers from frequent water crisis events caused by ecological pollution in watersheds. The river chief system policy is an institutional innovation by the government to deal with the ecological environmental crisis in the river basin. This study focuses on China's watershed environmental governance policy and describes the origin, operation mode, and governance effect of its river chief system policy. This study comparatively analyses the advantages of the policy in basin environmental governance, such as clear government responsibility, enhanced coordination among government departments, the accountability mechanism of the one-vote veto system, and the disadvantages of the policy in terms of high costs, information asymmetry, and lack of public participation. Furthermore, this study proposes suggestions on the sustainable development of watershed environmental governance from three aspects: regional characteristics, investment, and institutional innovation of policy implementation.

TI Addressing Uncertainty of Environmental Governance in Environmentally
   Sensitive Areas in Developing Countries: A Precise-Strike and
   Spatial-Targeting Adaptive Governance Framework
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Endowed with distinctive natural ecosystems and abundant biodiversity, regional environmental governance in developing countries, especially the environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), is facing the daunting task to ultimately divert their regional development mode towards sustainable fashion through governance transition. However, given their less-developed status in particular expressed by under-developed economies, unsound political regimes, low governance capacity, such task seemingly insurmountable. In order to approach the incompatibility between economic development and maintenance of the ecosystem services value, and understand the complex and interlocked nature of the regional institution system of ESAs in developing countries, an ecosystem services value-based adaptive governance model was introduced to identify the deficiencies and failures of existing regional environmental governance and establish innovative arenas and transition agendas for innovating and reframing regional institutions and modifying role of regional actor groups and governance mode in the process of decision making on environmental issues. Such approaches were conducted in a circular diverting process in order to facilitate the mode of regional development transforming towards sustainable development. For demonstration the process of application and effectiveness of this methodology, a case study was conducted in a typical ESAs-the Water Source Area of the Middle Route Project of the South-North Water Diversion Project in China. Through integrating the ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment into a wider framework of institutional change, the regional institution system innovation and reformation was directed by taking the ESV changes and pattern of its geo-distribution in the research area as indicators or clues. Compared with traditional proposals for administrative change, the methodology proposed in this study was not prescriptive or directive: Rather, an approach for influencing the direction and speed of transition through a series of steering and coordination mechanism. Therefore, this model is with the potential to be implemented by local communities in regions, especially ESAs in developing countries, to encounter with similar regional development challenges and complex, interlocking, and over-dated regional institutional system associated with environmental issues.

TI Linking armed conflict to malnutrition during pregnancy, breastfeeding,
   and childhood
SO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Background: Women in LMICs are important agricultural actors; however, these same women, and with their children, suffer high rates of acute malnutrition during armed conflicts.
   Methods and Fidings: A review was undertaken of peer-reviewed literature to describe how armed conflict drives acute malnutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children. Armed conflict factors driving malnutrition were conceptualized as belonging to one of eight overarching drivers.
   Conclusion: Future research must examine the effect of specific drivers on acute malnutrition in order to improve predictive models; emphasize inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding participants in studies; elucidate the role of peacekeepers in mitigating the risk of acute malnutrition; explore how to support breastfeeding women living in armed conflict situations; and explore how displaced populations affect host communities' food systems.

TI A meta-analysis of natural resources and conflict
SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
AB The relationship between natural resource wealth and civil conflict remains unclear, despite prolonged scholarly attention. Conducting a meta-analysis-a quantitative literature review-can help synthesize this broad and disparate field to provide clearer directions for future research. Meta-analysis tools determine both the aggregate effect of natural resources on conflict and whether any particular ways in which variables are measured systematically bias the estimated effect. I conduct a meta-analysis using sixty-nine studies from sixty-two authors. I find that there is no aggregate relationship between natural resources and conflict. Most variation in variable measurement does not alter the estimated effect. However, measuring natural resource wealth using Primary Commodity Exports and including controls for mountainous terrain and ethnic fractionalization all do significantly impact the results. These findings suggest that it may be worth exploring more nuanced connections between natural resources and conflict instead of continuing to study the overall relationship.

TI More equal than others? A comparative analysis of state and non-state
   perceptions of interest representation and decision-making in REDD plus
   negotiations
SO INNOVATION-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB This paper provides a quantitative analysis of stakeholder perceptions regarding the governance of the UN climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+). Governance quality and legitimacy were evaluated by means of an online survey conducted in 2011, using a normative framework of principles, criteria and indicators. The paper concentrates on national-level stakeholders active in REDD+ in Nepal, and their perceptions of governance quality, with a discussion, given the focus of this special volume, that emphasizes inclusiveness, equality and resources (indicators of interest representation) and democracy, agreement and dispute settlement (indicators of decision-making). Respondents were selected from state (i.e. governmental) and non-state (i.e. civil society) interests from a range of sectors active in REDD+ at the national level. The results show that survey respondents generally found REDD+ to be inclusive, but did not consider that there was the necessary capacity, or resources, for meaningful participation. A concluding section reviews the framework applied, and comments on the nature of multi-stakeholder relations in contemporary global governance, and REDD+ specifically.

AB The drug trade and terrorism are key threats to Central Asia. In order to fight them, governments there are seeking to work together through the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. But effective co-operation going beyond symbolic military manoeuvres is faltering, because those in power distrust one another, see different threats, and prefer bilateral relations. The states are part of the problem: The regimes' repressive domestic policies foment Islamic extremism and corruption. Infiltration by organised crime is paralysing state agencies.

When examining the quality of life of IDP, three main components were assessed: 1) functional abilities, the ability to carry out daily activities, general health; 2) social functioning: perception, attitudes, priorities, values, meanings of a person; 3) subjective well-being, emotional state. Using the research results will allow to optimize social planning and management, as well as to implement a scientifically sound social policy regarding IDP in Ukraine, which, in turn, will contribute to improving the quality of life of this population group.

TI The International Law and Politics of Water Access: Experiences of
   Displacement, Statelessness, and Armed Conflict
SO WATER
AB This article analyses international law regarding the human right to water as it impacts people who are stateless, displaced, and/or residents of armed conflict zones in the contemporary Middle East. Deficiencies in international law, including humanitarian, water, human rights, and criminal law, are examined to demonstrate international law's strengths and weaknesses for functioning as a guarantor of essential rights for vulnerable groups already facing challenges resulting from ambiguous legal statuses. What are the political factors causing lack of water access, and what international legal protections exist to protect vulnerable groups when affected by water denial? The analysis is framed by Hannah Arendt's assertion that loss of citizenship in a sovereign state leaves people lacking "the right to have rights", as human rights are inextricably connected to civil rights. This article demonstrates that stateless/displaced persons and armed conflict zone residents are disproportionately impacted by lack of water, yet uniquely vulnerable under international law. This paper offers unprecedented analysis of international criminal law's role in grappling with water access restrictions. I challenge existing "water wars" arguments, instead proposing remedies for international law's struggle to guarantee the human right to water for refugees/internally displaced persons (IDPs). Examples include Israel/Palestine, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. A key original contribution is the application of Arendt's theory of the totalising impacts of human rights violations to cases of water access denial, arguing that these scenarios are examples of environmental injustice that restrict vulnerable persons' abilities to access their human rights.

AB Sri Lankan civil war was ended in 2009, keeping a great role to be played the actors in terms of peace building. Among them reconciliation has become the foremost approach in peace building discourse. According to the current discourse, the civil war has ended with a unilateral war victory the ethnic conflict is still going on with no war conditions and with absence of holistic approach to solve it. Therefore, there will be a great contingency for the reproduction of civil war in future. Thus, it is very important to identify the major issues which direct to the reproduction of war in future. Civil war is also a kind of disaster which can be categorized as a manmade disaster. Hence, this paper seeks to explore the following research problem. Why that is the reconciliation become a difficult and complex in Sri Lanka? This study employed a multiple methods to gather data including a survey and in-depth interviews. The survey was conducted in the districts of Mannar, Vauvniya, Mullativu and Thrincomalee with a total sample of 200. Similarly 30 in-depth interviews were carried out with policy makers, politicians, academics, journalists, activists of civil society and researchers. When it comes to the initial findings, following reasons can be identifies as the potential facts for the reproduction of civil war in future. 1) Lack of unanimity amongst the actors within the government regarding the post war reconciliation, 2) Confrontational agenda between the government, civil society organizations and international community, 3) Ambiguity maintained with regard to policies on reconciliation and peace building, 4) Contradiction among the key policy makers in the reconciliation process and 6) Greater deal of the ignorance among the general public. Therefore, national security and restoration of normalcy are being regarded as the salient issues in the post-war landscape in Sri Lanka. Hence, end of the civil war, it has opened up a new opportunity and time to focus more on sustainable peace and space to deal with the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka. In this no war condition, still Sri Lanka has filed to overcome the risk of war in future. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Periphery versus Periphery: The Stakes of Separatist War
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB Center versus periphery distributional conflict is the standard explanation for separatist war. However, many separatists face strong opposition from other groups in their area. The likelihood of separatist war depends on the center's political relationships with competing groups in the periphery. This article demonstrates two patterns in separatist war onset worldwide at the ethnic group level. Groups with a political advantage in the capital relative to their regional neighbors are less likely to have grievances about local political and economic institutions and have a lower probability of separatist war. On the other hand, ethnic groups that share territory with the most powerful ethnic group in their country are deterred from separatist violence. The center's commitment to defend the regional status quo is particularly credible. Given the importance of within-periphery rivalries to separatist war, policy interventions designed to resolve center/periphery resource conflict may be ineffective against violence.

TI THE HEAD OF JANO IN THE EVOLUTION OF INTERNAL IUS IN BELLO AND THE
   QUESTION OF THE NEW INTERNAL IUS CONTRA BELLUM INTERNUM
SO DERECHO PENAL Y CRIMINOLOGIA
AB Since 1945, most armed conflicts took place between states and rebels or between non-state armed groups within fragile or failed states. Currently, the dramas in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine show us that the civil war is one of the major evils of our time. Recognizing this fact, the right of non-international armed conflict, particularly since the first half of the 90s, has experienced a rather stormy development. This legal development has two faces like Janus head: one is characterized by the humanization of the law of non-international armed conflicts. However, on the other hand, the rules governing conduct in hostilities have crystallized, where his name as 'humanitarian' continues to be euphemistic. It is worth asking whether the development of the law of non-international armed conflict must be complemented by a right against non-international armed conflict. The present controversy over legal policy about the privilege to non-state Fighter warriors must operate in this new light.

TI Polycentricity in practice: Marine governance transitions in Southeast
   Asia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Environmental governance systems are expanding in size and complexity as they become more integrated and ecosystem-based. In doing so, governance transitions often involve more actors and knowingly or unknowingly alter the autonomy of actors to make decisions, and thereby the ability of the governance system to self-organise. In other words, these governance systems are becoming increasingly polycentric, moving towards an institutional structure that is reported to confer a number of benefits to social-ecological systems. This article adds to a growing body of evidence on polycentric environmental governance in practice. It adds nuance to the normative and apolitical portrayals of governance transitions in general, and transitions towards more polycentric forms of governance in particular. We analyse the relations amongst actors and historical development of four large-scale marine governance systems in Southeast Asia to understand how context, particularly power, shapes the emergence and evolution of polycentric marine governance in practice. Our data indicate that transitions towards increased polycentricity do increase diversity and autonomy of decision-making centres, which can enable more innovation or flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. However, these innovations do not always underpin sustainability and equity. Coordination mechanisms are critical for channelling the power dynamics that emerge among diverse actors towards sustainability. Yet, in these emergent, ad hoc polycentric governance arrangements such mechanisms remained nascent, ineffective, or inactive. The transaction costs involved in coordinating a semi-autonomous polycentric system are seemingly difficult to overcome in low- to middle-income contexts and need investment in resources and accountability mechanisms.

TI The Loyalty Trap: Regime Ethnic Exclusion, Commitment Problems, and
   Civil War Duration in Syria and Beyond
SO SECURITY STUDIES
AB This article examines the impact of the ethnic exclusiveness of regimes on commitment problems and hence on civil conflict duration. It argues that members of privileged in-groups in highly exclusive regimes can be trapped into compliance with the regime. Ethnic exclusion helps to construct privileged-group members as regime loyalists. They therefore fear rebel reprisals even if they surrender or defect and consequently persist in fighting. The article finds in particular that, in ethnically exclusive regimes, privileged-group members mistrust even rebels who mobilize on a nonethnic agenda and regard rebel reassurances, including nonethnic aims, as suspect. Exclusion therefore induces privileged-group cohesion, an effect more resistant to rebel reassurances than previously recognized. A case study of the Syrian civil war shows this dynamic at a micro level, and a cross-national statistical analysis gives partial evidence that it lengthens civil conflicts on a larg`e scale.

TI Connecting international and domestic dots: how conflict entanglement
   informs resolution and escalation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThis paper aims to seek to and understand how civil conflict and international claims inform one another. Does the existence of ongoing civil and international conflicts affect how a government addresses an international claim? The paper builds on existing literature that link international and domestic conflict. However, it suggests that the logic behind civil conflicts may be different from that for international ones as states decide how to deal with any one claim. Design/methodology/approachThe paper posits that states faced with domestic conflicts and additional international claims are more likely to seek to resolve an international claim than those without similar conflicts. It develops a series of hypotheses about the likelihood of claim escalation and peaceful settlement attempts and proceed to test them quantitatively using the Issue Correlates of War data combined with the uppsala conflict data program/peace research institute oslo Armed Conflict Data. FindingsOn the one hand, the paper finds support for the argument regarding the difficulty states are faced with when seeking to resolve multiple international claims. On the other hand, it finds that the presence of civil conflicts incentivizes states to resolve international claims either by force or peacefully, suggesting internal violence can both lead to diversionary behavior and attempts at conflict resolution. Research limitations/implicationsThe findings have important implications for work considering the complexity of domestic and international conflict linkages. Originality/valueWhile many studies of claim militarization and peaceful attempts focus on dyadic and international characteristics, this paper creates a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of this foreign policy decision process.

TI Health workers and the weaponisation of health care in Syria: a
   preliminary inquiry for The Lancet-American University of Beirut
   Commission on Syria
SO LANCET
AB The conflict in Syria presents new and unprecedented challenges that undermine the principles and practice of medical neutrality in armed conflict. With direct and repeated targeting of health workers, health facilities, and ambulances, Syria has become the most dangerous place on earth for health-care providers. The weaponisation of health care-a strategy of using people's need for health care as a weapon against them by violently depriving them of it-has translated into hundreds of health workers killed, hundreds more incarcerated or tortured, and hundreds of health facilities deliberately and systematically attacked. Evidence shows use of this strategy on an unprecedented scale by the Syrian Government and allied forces, in what human rights organisations described as a war-crime strategy, although all parties seem to have committed violations. Attacks on health care have sparked a large-scale exodus of experienced health workers. Formidable challenges face health workers who have stayed behind, and with no health care a major factor in the flight of refugees, the effect extends well beyond Syria. The international community has left these violations of international humanitarian and human rights law largely unanswered, despite their enormous consequences. There have been repudiated denunciations, but little action on bringing the perpetrators to justice. This inadequate response challenges the foundation of medical neutrality needed to sustain the operations of global health and humanitarian agencies in situations of armed conflict. In this Health Policy, we analyse the situation of health workers facing such systematic and serious violations of international humanitarian law. We describe the tremendous pressures that health workers have been under and continue to endure, and the remarkable resilience and resourcefulness they have displayed in response to this crisis. We propose policy imperatives to protect and support health workers working in armed conflict zones.

TI The Joint Effect of International and Domestic-Level State Capacity on
   Civil War Risk
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This article examines the role of international and domestic-level factors for strengthening states' capacity. State failure enhances insecurity, since there is not sufficient agency or institutions to provide adequate security guarantees and to put into operation established rules. When the government is unable to address grievances stemming from such insecurity, armed conflict becomes more likely. Links with external institutions and domestic-level capacity that increases prosperity prevent insurgencies and promote stability, however. To this end, this research develops a new theory linking state capacity and the international and domestic-level factors to internal conflict. Empirically, this study examines the risk of civil conflict onset, focusing on the combined effect of international (political globalisation) and domestic-level (GDP per capita) state capacity as the main driving force. The results show that the joint effect of these factors has a negative impact on civil war risk, which is significantly and substantially important.

TI Sensitivity analysis of empirical results on civil war onset
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB In the literature on civil war onset, several empirical results are not robust or replicable across studies. Studies use different definitions of civil war and analyze different time periods, so readers cannot easily determine if differences in empirical results are due to those factors or if most empirical results are just not robust. The authors apply a methodology for organized specification tests to check the robustness of empirical results. They isolate causes of variation in empirical results by using the same definition of civil war and analyzing the same time period while systematically exploring the sensitivity of eighty-eight variables used to explain civil war in the literature. Several relationships with the onset of civil wars prove robust: large population and low income levels, low rates of economic growth, recent political instability and inconsistent democratic institutions, small military establishments and rough terrain, and war-prone and undemocratic neighbors. Variables representing ethnic difference in the population are robust only in relation to lower level armed conflict.

TI Towards further developing the law of non-international armed conflict:
   a proposal for a jus in bello interno and a new jus contra bellum
   internum
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS
AB Since 1945, most armed conflicts have occurred between States and rebels or between non-State armed groups within fragile or failed States. Currently, the tragedies in Iraq, Syria and the Ukraine teach us just another lesson that the civil war is one of the major evils of our time. In recognition of this fact, the law of non-international armed conflict, in particular since the first half of the 1990s, has undergone a stormy development. This has led to the remarkably far-reaching assimilation between that body of law and that of international armed conflict. This legal development is Janus-headed: on the one hand, it is characterized by the humanization of the law of non-international armed conflict, but on the other, rules on the conduct of hostilities have crystallized and their denomination as "humanitarian" is somewhat euphemistic. It appears worth asking whether the recent development of the law of non-international armed conflict should be complemented through a new international law against non-international armed conflict. The ongoing controversy in legal policy about a possible privilege of combatancy for non-State fighters should be discussed in such a new light.

TI Indigenous Peoples and Multiscalar Environmental Governance: The Opening
   and Closure of Participatory Spaces
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB There has been an unprecedented inclusion of Indigenous peoples in environmental governance instruments like free, prior, and informed consent; reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) projects; climate adaptation initiatives; and environmental impact assessment. We draw on theories of participatory governance to show how locally implemented processes have been shaped by their interactions with invited, closed, and indigenous-led spaces at multiple scales. Empirically, our article is based on field research in Latin America, semistructured interviews, and a systematic literature review. We find four main barriers that have (re-)produced environmental injustices in environmental governance: first, a lack of influence over the institutional design of governance instruments; second, the exclusion of Indigenous peoples in the domestication of global instruments; third, policy incoherencies constraining the scope for decision-making; and fourth, weak cross-scale linkages between Indigenous-led spaces. This article helps to elucidate constraints of participatory spaces and identify leeway for transformation toward environmental justice.

TI A clash of generations? Youth bulges and political violence
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB It has frequently been suggested that exceptionally large youth cohorts, the so-called "youth bulges," make countries more susceptible to political violence. Within two prominent theoretical frameworks in the study of civil war, youth bulges are argued to potentially increase both opportunities and motives for political violence. This claim is empirically tested in a time-series cross-national statistical model for internal armed conflict for the period 1950-2000, and for event data for terrorism and rioting for the years 1984-1995. The expectation that youth bulges should increase the risk of political violence receives robust support for all three forms of violence. The results are consistent both with an expectation that youth bulges provide greater opportunities for violence through the abundant supply of youths with low opportunity costs, and with an expectation that stronger motives for violence may arise as youth bulges are more likely to experience institutional crowding, in particular unemployment. Some contextual factors have been suggested to potentially enhance the effect of youth bulges. In an empirical test of these propositions, the study suggests that youth bulges are particularly associated with an increasing risk of internal armed conflict in starkly autocratic regimes, but a similar effect is also found for highly democratic countries. The interaction of youth bulges with economic decline and expansion in higher education appear to increase the risk of terrorism but not of rioting. Recent studies in economic demography find that when fertility is sharply decreasing, causing lower dependency ratios, large youth cohorts entering the labor market may lead to economic boosts. This study finds some empirical evidence complementing these results, indicating that the effect of youth bulges on political violence may decline along with reduced dependency ratios.

SO COMMONWEALTH & COMPARATIVE POLITICS
AB The management of ethno-national conflict remains an important issue on the security agendas of states and international organisations alike, from the Western Balkans to the Middle East and Asia Pacific, from subSaharan Africa to Central Asia and the Far East. The practical need to manage ethno-national conflict has also resulted in thorough academic engagement with the subject, which has generated a range of different theories of conflict management. This contribution will provide an overview of the current debate and examine the differences and similarities between three different theories-liberal consociationalism, centripetalism, and power-dividing. Based on this examination, an analytical framework is developed to identify the conditions under which ethno-national conflict management can succeed in providing settlements in the framework of which sustainable peace is attainable.

TI Promoting democratic governance and preventing the recurrence of
   conflict: The role of the United Nations development programme in
   post-conflict peace-building
SO JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
AB Promoting democracy and strengthening good governance have become core components of post-conflict peace-building initiatives of the United Nations (UN). An often overlooked dimension of the analysis of UN peace support operations has been the crucial role played by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the critical juncture linking peacekeeping to sustainable development. UN peace operations in Central America over the last decade have pioneered the organisation's involvement in the uncharted territory of post-conflict peace building. UNDP's Central American experience was the first step in the organisation's evolution away from providing traditional development assistance, towards playing an active and openly political role in post-conflict democracy building and governance reform. This new role of the UNDP has had dramatic repercussions on its mandate, administrative structures, corporate policies and operational strategies. The current institutional renewal of UNDP has its roots in its endorsement of democratic governance as essential dimensions of its mandate to promote sustainable human development. This article assesses the significance, promises and dilemmas of the governance agenda for UNDP and analyses the scope, nature and institutionalisation of democracy and governance programmes within UNDP, using Central America as a case study. It argues that the future of UNDP democracy assistance will largely depend on how successful it is at resolving the inherent tensions between democracy promotion and national sovereignty, while retaining its multilateral approach to peace and democracy.

TI Natural disasters and the risk of violent civil conflict
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB Does the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, flood, hurricane, epidemic, heat wave, and/or plague increase the risk of violent civil conflict in a society? This study uses available data for 187 political units for the period 1950-2000 to systematically explore this question that has received remarkably little attention in the voluminous literature on civil war. We find that natural disasters significantly increase the risk of violent civil conflict both in the short and medium term, specifically in low- and middle-income countries that have intermediate to high levels of inequality, mixed political regimes, and sluggish economic growth. Rapid-onset disasters related to geology and climate pose the highest overall risk, but different dynamics apply to minor as compared to major conflicts. The findings are robust in terms of the use of different dependent and independent variables, and a variety of model specifications. Given the likelihood that rapid climate change will increase the incidence of some types of natural disasters, more attention should be given to mitigating the social and political risks posed by these cataclysmic events.

AB The fact that many civil wars involve several warring parties is often highlighted as an obstacle to conflict resolution. However, this issue has so far attracted little attention in previous research. This article aims to contribute to filling this gap. It is argued that whereas only very strong rebel groups should be able to force concessions, a multiparty context can turn the tables and increase the chances for weak rebel groups to reach a deal. The empirical analysis is based on dyadic data covering the government and each rebel group in all internal armed conflicts, 1989-2003. In accordance with the theory, it is found that the likelihood that the government and a weak rebel group will reach a negotiated settlement increases with the number of warring parties in the conflict.

TI The rise of the Red Mafia in China: a case study of organised crime and
   corruption in Chongqing
SO TRENDS IN ORGANIZED CRIME
AB 'Red Mafia' is the collective term for corrupt public officials in mainland China, mainly from the criminal justice system, who attempt to monopolise the protection business in the criminal underworld by abusing power. In contemporary mainland China, the Red Mafia has developed into an alternative system of governance that can control organised crime groups, enable them to flourish, and protect them where strong government and effective self-protection associations are absent. The author examines organised crime and corruption by analysing the Wen Qiang case, one of the most famous and widely publicised cases in Chongqing's latest crime crackdown campaign. Drawing on interview data and extensive published materials, this paper offers a tentative definition of 'Red Mafia', develops a typology of organised crime, describes the emergence of the Red Mafia in China, explores how gangsters developed relationships with public officials, suggests why organised crime groups chose the Red Mafia as their preferred protection and enforcement mechanism, examines patterns of services provided, and explores the differences between the Red Mafia and other Mafia groups.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
AB The World Bank promotes public-private partnerships as vehicles for democratizing environmental governance. This article presents an overview of their constitution in the World Bank, including what the Bank as an organization identified as their promise, and investigates what its partnerships for biodiversity conservation achieved. The article focuses on the institutional design of partnerships' governance structures, and assesses their democratic quality based on their potential to enable inclusion and empowerment of stakeholders. It examines nine global biodiversity partnerships between the World Bank and non-state actors from 1992 to 2008 and analyses the extent to which they have fulfilled the principled expectations expressed by the Bank. I find that partnerships have been organized through institutional arrangements that fail to promote inclusiveness and empowerment, which are minimum normative inputs for democratic decision-making in natural resource management. This suggests that World Bank partnerships are not sufficiently well poised to fulfil the democratic promise. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Enhancing the adaptive capacity of individuals, communities, institutions and nations is pivotal to protecting and improving human health and well-being in the face of systemic social inequity plus dangerous climate change. However, research on the determinants of adaptive capacity in relation to health, particularly concerning the role of governance, is in its infancy. This paper highlights the intersections between global health, climate change and governance. It presents an overview of these key concerns, their relation to each other, and the potential that a greater understanding of governance may present opportunities to strengthen policy and action responses to the health effects of climate change. Important parallels between addressing health inequities and sustainable development practices in the face of global environmental change are also highlighted. We propose that governance can be investigated through two key lenses within the earth system governance theoretical framework; agency and architecture. These two governance concepts can be evaluated using methods of social network research and policy analysis using case studies and is the subject of further research.

TI Bringing resource management back into the environmental governance
   agenda: eco-state restructuring in China
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The primary aim of ancient Chinese environmental governance was to efficiently manage the country's limited natural resources; this was also reflected in the context of the hydraulic society. From the 1950s to 1960s, the utilisation of Chinese natural resources, especially for food security, dominated the development of the environmental governance agenda. As China has become urbanised and industrialised since the late 1970s, its environmental governance agenda shifted from rural centrism to urban centrism in the 1980s, and from resource management to pollution control in the 1990s, and then to carbon control in the 2000s. Thus, the establishment and evolution of the environmental protection agency attracted most attention while addressing contemporary Chinese environmental governance. However, in March 2018, the Chinese government reshaped its environmental protection agency by broadening the Ministries of Natural Resources and Ecological Environment to include pollution control and resource management. Consequently, the traditional environmental governance agenda of managing natural resources is re-emerging. This study examines why and how the environmental governance agenda of resource management has evolved in China; it then applies the theory of eco-state restructuring to describe the waves of China's environmental governance agenda. The study contributes to the theoretical work on China's evolving environmental governance agenda and descriptive work on the re-emerging dimensions of resource management for Chinese environmental governance.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As a critical aspect of corporate financing strategies, high-quality trade credit has been acknowledged as a favorable indicator for external stakeholders. Given the increasing prominence of sustainable development, it is worthwhile to explore whether an advanced environmental management system facilitates the attainment of financing for business operations. Therefore, to respond to this question, this study utilizes panel data spanning from 2012 to 2021, comprising Chinese listed firms in four energy and environment-related sectors, with the environmental dimension score of the CSI ESG scoring system employed for categorizing the sample into high and low environmental governance groups. The results reconcile the conflicting studies and find an inverted U-shaped effect between trade credit and corporate bank loans with lower levels of environmental governance. Within the domain characterized by higher environmental governance, the two are substituted for each other. In addition, this study introduces the Shapely decomposition method for the first time to quantify the contribution of trade credit to corporate bank loans. Drawing from these findings, we proposed practical advice to firms, financial institutions, and the government on how to choose between bank loans and trade credit against the background of sustainable development.

AB The present study addressed the effects of two context variables, such as work experience and gender on conflict resolution ways of employees working in service sector. This was for the intention of ascertaining the relative impact of work experience and gender on conflict resolution ways towards ensuring sustainable peace and harmony in service organizations. A total of 151 respondents were selected for the study using convenience sampling technique and were asked to indicate their response in terms of the ten factors of conflict resolution. A set of questionnaire titled 'Conflict Resolution Questionnaire' developed by Marcus Henning based on the factors presented by McClellan (1997c) was used for data collection. The findings revealed that: there was no significant difference between male and female managers' conflict resolution ways. Further, work experience produced significant effect on conflict management. Experienced employees communicate clearly various conflict issues; control emotions; identify essential needs that have to be met by focusing on future relationship generate all possible alternatives to agreements when resolving conflict. The implications for the study are discussed.

An aspect of knowledge-governance interactions that has received relatively little focused attention is that knowledge can be understood to be an intrinsic element of environmental governance. This paper aims to further the theoretical and empirical insight into this aspect. In order to do so, it elaborates a framework that conceptualizes various governance capacities, i.e. regulatory, adaptive, and integrative capacity, in terms of the coproduction of knowledge, values, and social order. This framework is applied in the analysis of three domains of governance that notably concern the management of the Dutch Wadden Sea area. The findings suggest that settling disputes about natural resources, and working towards a sustainable equilibrium between conserving and utilizing nature, may be enabled by means of interactive and flexible governance arrangements that complement centralized governance. Moreover, knowledge may constitute the governance capacities that are needed for reaching such an equilibrium in various ways: as a steering mechanism, as a key to learning, and as a connective element of governance. The findings indicate that enabling well-informed environmental governance is not just a matter of managing the interfaces between knowledge and governance, but also a matter of capacity-building in order to bring about reflexive governance arrangements.

TI Rights, Knowledge, and Governance for Improved Health Equity in Urban
   Settings
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
AB All three of the interacting aspects of daily urban life (physical environment, social conditions, and the added pressure of climate change) that affect health inequities are nested within the concept of urban governance, which has the task of understanding and managing the interactions among these different factors so that all three can be improved together and coherently. Governance is defined as: "the process of collective decision making and processes by which decisions are implemented or not implemented": it is concerned with the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power. Although there appears to be general agreement that the quality of governance is important for development, much less agreement appears to exist on what the concept really implies and how it should be used. Our review of the literature confirmed significant variation in meaning as well as in the practice of urban governance arrangements. The review found that the linkage between governance practices and health equity is under-researched and/or has been neglected. Reconnecting the fields of urban planning, social sciences, and public health are essential "not only for improving local governance, but also for understanding and addressing global political change" for enhanced urban health equity. Social mobilization, empowering governance, and improved knowledge for sustainable and equitable development in urban settings is urgently needed. A set of strategic research questions are suggested.

TI Genomics governance: advancing justice, fairness and equity through the
   lens of the African communitarian ethic of Ubuntu
SO MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY
AB There is growing interest for a communitarian approach to the governance of genomics, and for such governance to be grounded in principles of justice, equity and solidarity. However, there is a near absence of conceptual studies on how communitarian-based principles, or values, may inform, support or guide the governance of genomics research. Given that solidarity is a key principle in Ubuntu, an African communitarian ethic and theory of justice, there is emerging interest about the extent to which Ubuntu could offer guidance for the governance of genomics research in Africa. To this effect, we undertook a conceptual analysis of Ubuntu with the goal of identifying principles that could inform equity-oriented governance of genomics research. Solidarity, reciprocity, open sharing, accountability, mutual trust, deliberative decision-making and inclusivity were identified as core principles that speak directly to the different macro-level ethical issues in genomics research in Africa such as: the exploitation of study populations and African researchers, equitable access and use of genomics data, benefit sharing, the possibility of genomics to widen global health inequities and the fair distribution of resources such as intellectual property and patents. We use the identified the principles to develop ethical guidance for genomics governance in Africa.

TI Reassessing the Role of Theory and Machine Learning in Forecasting Civil
   Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB We examine the research protocols in Blair and Sambanis' recent article on forecasting civil wars, where they argue that their theory-based model can predict civil war onsets better than several atheoretical alternatives or a model with country-structural factors. We find that there are several important mistakes and that their key finding is entirely conditional on the use of parametrically smoothed ROC curves when calculating accuracy, rather than the standard empirical ROC curves that dominate the literature. Fixing these mistakes results in a reversal of their claim that theory-based models of escalation are better at predicting onsets of civil war than other kinds of models. Their model is outperformed by several of the ad hoc, putatively non-theoretical models they devise and examine. More importantly, we argue that rather than trying to contrast the roles of theory and "atheoretical" machine learning in predictive modeling, it would be more productive to focus on ways in which predictive modeling and machine learning could be used to strengthen extant predictive work. Instead, we argue that predictive modeling and machine learning are effective tools for theory testing.

TI English Global Health and Security - an Overview of Academic Knowledge
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB Global health issues are relevant to international peace and security in numerous ways but have so far received little attention in the United Nations Security Council. This article provides an overview of the status of academic knowledge about the ways that global health and international peace and security are connected, and it highlights four main causal relationships. First, societies with poor overall health conditions or with great health inequalities between different groups, are more prone to armed conflict. Second, health crises can weaken societies' resilience and capacity to deal with conflict. Third, health interventions may contribute to stabilize vulnerable post-conflict societies in the wake of conflict. And fourth, armed conflict makes it more difficult to solve health crises. All four aspects of the health and security nexus directly or indirectly touch on Norway's four main priorities as an elected member of the UN Security Council in 2021-2022. The presentation of the various causal relations demonstrates that global health issues are clearly relevant for global security.

TI Creating the conditions for peacemaking: theories of practice in ethnic
   conflict resolution
SO ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES
AB Establishing the conditions for effective intergroup peacemaking is a formidable task in severe ethnic conflicts. Conflict resolution practitioners argue that a critical first step is developing preconditions which convince competing groups that there are opponents to whom it is worth talking, that it is possible to create structural changes conducive to a stable peace, and that an agreement is possible which can meet each side's basic concerns and needs. This article compares six theories of practice of ethnic conflict resolution: community relations, principled negotiation; human needs; psychoanalytically rooted identity; intercultural miscommunications and conflict transformation, examining how each understands ethnic conflict; the goals it articulates; the effects of good practice on participants in interventions; the mechanisms by which the project achieves its impact; and the dynamics of transfer affecting the course of a wider conflict. It is argued that clearer articulation of these assumptions will improve both theory and practice in the search for settlements to severe ethnic conflict.

TI Muddying the Waters: The Anatomy of Resistance Campaigns and the Failure
   of Ceasefires in Civil Wars
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Ceasefires are a critical tool for those engaged in conflict management during civil wars, yet little scholarship exists that systematically assesses the durability of these arrangements. We argue that ceasefire failure is driven by variations in the composition of organized dissent including and beyond the context of the civil war. In particular, ceasefires should break down faster given increasingly complicated environments of broader anti-government dissent, where resistance dynamics alter the perceived or actual balance of power between rebels and the state. Using original data on organizations participating in violent and nonviolent dissent across African states from 1990-2015, and new data on civil war ceasefires, we find that ceasefire breakdown is precipitated by complex resistance environments that put the government in a precarious position. Increasing numbers of mobilized organizations, higher ideological fractionalization among those groups, more dense and increasingly decentralized dissident networks all expedite the failure of ceasefires in civil wars.

TI Human rights and the environment in the Anthropocene
SO ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW
AB Human rights are considered ethical demands that operate at an elevated juridical level. They have become popular legal constructs that contribute to the traditional instrumentalist and the more esoteric functions of law. While there is often considerable criticism leveled against human rights, as creatures of law and as legal mechanisms possessing unique characteristics, they are also uniquely situated and able to perform a singular mediating role in the human-environment interface. The recent mushrooming of rights to a healthy environment, environmental-related procedural rights and other substantive political and socio-economic rights bearing on environmental interests, is testimony to their increasing popularity. Yet, despite their prevalence in the environmental regulatory domain, the arrival of the Anthropocene is possibly set to require a complete rethink of the way in which we use human rights to mediate the human-environment interface. This is because the Anthropocene presents an urgent call for dramatic regulatory interventions of a kind hitherto unseen. Accepting the continuing prevalence of human rights as part of the environmental regulatory domain, this article argues that there is every reason to believe that their traditional role, nature, objectives and construction should change because of the Anthropocene. The article carries this argument by discussing the Anthropocene and its features that might influence conceptions of human rights and the environment as they are currently embedded in the social institutions of environmental law and governance. The argument then uses climate change as a useful explanatory context to identify and to understand the different types of rights issues that might arise in the Anthropocene. The next part of the discussion then takes stock of human rights in the environmental context by evaluating the way in which they currently mediate the human-environment interface. The article concludes with suggestions founding a re-imagination of the relationship between human rights and the environment in the Anthropocene.

TI Advancing Social Equity in and Through Marine Conservation
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Substantial efforts and investments are being made to increase the scale and improve the effectiveness of marine conservation globally. Though it is mandated by international law and central to conservation policy, less attention has been given to how to operationalize social equity in and through the pursuit of marine conservation. In this article, we aim to bring greater attention to this topic through reviewing how social equity can be better integrated in marine conservation policy and practice. Advancing social equity in marine conservation requires directing attention to: recognition through acknowledgment and respect for diverse peoples and perspectives; fair distribution of impacts through maximizing benefits and minimizing burdens; procedures through fostering participation in decision-making and good governance; management through championing and supporting local involvement and leadership; the environment through ensuring the efficacy of conservation actions and adequacy of management to ensure benefits to nature and people; and the structural barriers to and institutional roots of inequity in conservation. We then discuss the role of various conservation organizations in advancing social equity in marine conservation and identify the capacities these organizations need to build. We urge the marine conservation community, including governments, non-governmental organizations and donors, to commit to the pursuit of socially equitable conservation.

TI Adaptive Water Governance: Integrating the Human Dimensions into Water
   Resource Governance
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION
AB The command-and-control paradigm of water resource management that dominated 20th century water policy has resulted in vulnerabilities due to its inadequate consideration of the human dimensions as well as its failure to prioritize the need for learning and adapting to change and uncertainties. In response to these shortfalls, recent years have seen the emergence of alternative water policy frameworks, notably integrated water resource management (IWRM) and adaptive management. However, while IWRM broadens the planning goals and scope of water resource governance through integration and coordination across scales and sectors, it does not adequately emphasize learning to deal with uncertainty. On the other hand, adaptive management emphasizes the need to prioritize learning to deal with uncertainty in resource management through monitoring and experimentation, but places less emphasis on the human dimensions required for its successful implementation. This paper discusses adaptive water governance - collaborative, flexible, and learning-based institutions that connect state and non-state actors across multiple levels for ecosystem-based management of land and water resources - as a promising institutional mechanism for integrating the human dimensions into water resource governance while building the capacity of water resource systems to learn and adapt to change. The paper highlights four attributes of adaptive water governance: (1) reintegrating humans into nature; (2) integrating diverse sources and types of knowledge; (3) promoting adaptive and integrative management goals; and (4) using polycentric institutions and analytic deliberation processes. Through these mechanisms, adaptive governance can contribute to sustainability, good governance, conflict management, and social-ecological resilience in water resource systems.

While the peace agreements offer new opportunities for democratic land control, new institutions may end up reinforcing existing power relations. This article argues that linking land rights with human rights can be a powerful strategy for rural social justice and accountability. As the struggle for democratic land control moves from armed conflict to the political arena, mobilising from below will be a decisive factor as to whether rights, reform and restitution become a reality in post-conflict Colombia.

TI Legal pluralism and environmental governance: the regulatory design
   potential of Bhutan's gross national happiness and Canada's
   reconciliation approaches
SO LEGAL PLURALISM AND CRITICAL SOCIAL ANALYSIS
AB As humans exceed global ecological limits nation state-based environmental governance attracts persistent criticism. Historically, the focus of regulatory design for environmental law has been to provide access to natural resources or the environment but without ecosystem-based standards at any scale or cumulative effects assessment by which state governments evaluate whether they are achieving ecosystem health. Illuminated within these nation state regimes are two examples where legal pluralism has or is mandating environmental regulatory design that more explicitly elevates ecological function as a key outcome. Bhutan's relatively recent state environmental laws are part of its broader development approach of Gross National Happiness (GNH), an expression of state, Buddhist, and other customary laws. This 'internal legal pluralism' in state policy is expressed through multiple layers of plans and project review by administrative agencies and a GNH screening tool. By contrast, Canada is reforming its environmental laws to account for cumulative impacts and Indigenous rights. In particular, state governments have committed to aligning their laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and plural legal agreements establish unique collaborative governance bodies. The purpose of this article is to examine how legal pluralism is influencing the evolution of regulatory design for environmental governance in Bhutan and Canada. While the plural legal aspects of their regimes have resulted in the prioritization of ecological health, that focus in both regimes is vulnerable without further regulatory scaffolding to establish ecological limits that engage with multiple legal orders at various temporal and spatial scales.

TI Strong (green) institutions in weak states: Environmental governance and
   human (in)security in the Global South
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Over the last two decades, the international community has focused on building green institutional capacity in the Global South to foster human security across societies marked by rapid environmental change. Numerous nation-states have consequently institutionalized global models that have helped build administrative, fiscal, and regulatory capacity, as well as promote social and environmental protections. The emergence of strong (green) institutions, however, has not translated into the kind of social or environmental change expected; informal extractive activity (e.g., "illegal" mining), violent natural resource conflict, and environmental degradation remain enduring challenges. To understand why green governance reform has been unable to contribute to broader forms of human security, I analyze the process of institutional reform in the Global South, drawing specifically on minerals governance in Ghana and Sierra Leone. Building from multi-method fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2016, I contend that a persistent focus on institutional design has obscured the ways in which green institution building reconfigures cross-scalar power relations that mediate governance-security linkages. In particular, the reform process has channeled power to transnational networks, which constitute what I call the green regulatory state, that produce and reproduce insecurity by reorienting social relations around global standards of natural resource conduct that 1) limit options for domestic political engagement and 2) exacerbate institutional pluralism and conflict. This argument challenges scholarship that perceives insecurity as a function of weak governance capacity by repositioning it as a direct consequence of the growth of green governance. This article contributes to an emerging body of work that questions the growing enthusiasm for green governance as a mechanism to mitigate conflict and improve social and environmental justice. It simultaneously posits that achieving sustainability and security within the context of the Anthropocene requires a more intensive focus on constructing inclusive - rather than strong - governance institutions.

AB One of the most pressing problems confronting political scientists today is whether global governance has democratic legitimacy. Drawing on an analysis of the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002, this article advances and empirically deploys an ideal-typical model of a new approach to key areas of global governance - 'stakeholder democracy'. This work is located in the context of the changing practices of global governance, in which concerns about legitimacy, accountability, and participation have gained prominence. Sustainability is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, pluri-lateral forms of governance, such as stakeholder forums and partnership agreements institutionalizing relations between state and non-state actors, are taking place. A central argument is that sustainability governance imperfectly exemplifies new deliberative stakeholder practices with general democratic potential at the global level. In examining these governance arrangements, we draw together the nascent elements of this new 'model', such as its distinctive takes on political representation and accountability.

TI Armed conflict, terrorism, and the allocation of foreign aid
SO ECONOMICS OF PEACE AND SECURITY JOURNAL
AB "Armed conflict, terrorism, and the allocation of foreign aid." Armed conflict and terrorism damage economic development through disruption of economic activity, trade, and the destruction of human and physical resources. They also can affect foreign aid allocation, but the likely net effect of this is not obvious. On the one hand, donors may be discouraged and reduce aid. On the other hand, donors may provide more aid, for instance as a reimbursement for counter-terrorism efforts that benefit the donor country. This article aims to identify the net effect using data for a panel of countries. It finds that armed conflict does have a large and negative effect on bilateral and multilateral aid, but that bilateral donors seem to turn a blind eye to violence occurring in oil-exporting countries. Further, the article finds that while transnational terrorism tends to increase bilateral aid, bilateral donors seem indifferent to domestic terrorism. In contrast, multilateral aid is found not to react to transnational terrorism, but does react to domestic terrorism.

SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
AB Effective democracy requires effective mechanisms for society to influence public authorities. Interaction between government and citizens, active public participation in decision-making is the key to sustainable development, prosperity, and stability of state institutions, social programs, and economic growth. Political leadership and effective communication of the action plan to the public promote public order and security. In this paper, we explore the current state of information policy in a crisis. We used general scientific and special methods such as historical and philosophical, systemic, comparative. In the first part, we consider philosophical approaches to the concept of communication and the role of the state in shaping information policy. The second and third parts are devoted to specific examples of such policies within two countries: Ukraine and Azerbaijan. In conclusion, we argue that there are currently complex challenges for the information policy of both countries. This is especially true of health problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic and armed conflict.

TI Is Terrorism Really a Weapon of the Weak? Debunking the Conventional
   Wisdom
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB That terrorism is a "weapon of the weak" is such deeply held conventional wisdom it has become almost a cliche. "Weak" means many different things in the literature, however, and little rigorous empirical research has tested the contention that weaker groups, however conceived, are more likely to employ terrorism. This article explores prominent weapon of the weak arguments to develop testable hypotheses about group strength and the prevalence of terrorism. Using measures of deliberately indiscriminate attacks on civilians by rebel groups in civil conflicts, as well as multiple measures of rebel strength, it examines systematically whether weaker groups are more likely to employ terrorism. I find surprisingly little empirical support for the conventional wisdom. There is no clear or consistent evidence that deliberately indiscriminate terrorism is a weapon of the weak rather than the strong.

TI The Psychological Legacy of the Lebanese Civil War in Paramilitary
   Veterans
SO CIVIL WARS
AB The experiences of irregular combatants and the psychosocial impact of their participation in violent conflict are poorly understood in comparison to the body of research available on military veterans in developed countries. The Lebanese civil war (1975-1990) was an archetypal intra-national armed conflict, involving thousands of civilians turned fighters. Fifteen former fighters were interviewed about their active involvement in the war. The qualitative analysis reveals a persistent psychosocial burden decades later. Former paramilitary fighters have needs that overlap only partially with those of regular veterans. Further research on this population would be beneficial to global peacebuilding efforts and conflict prevention.

TI Globalization, economic shocks, and internal armed conflict
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB Critics of trade liberalization argue that globalization increases countries' vulnerability to economic shocks and hence may exacerbate domestic social conflict. Such social conflict may also be transformed into armed conflict. Others argue that globalization promotes economic growth and reduces poverty, which leads to a reduction in the risk of internal conflict. Several studies find trade to reduce the risk of interstate conflict. This article investigates the impact of trade and trade shocks on the risk of intrastate conflict. A set of operationalizations of economic shock is developed and used to analyze the risk of conflicts that involve at least 25 battle deaths per year. The analysis finds no robust evidence for a direct relationship between trade openness, trade shocks, and the risk of armed conflict. There is somewhat more basis for concluding that globalization affects the risk indirectly through its effect on long- and short-term growth. In the long run, trade-induced growth reduces the risk of domestic conflict.

TI International Investment Law in the Context of Jus Post Bellum: Are
   Investment Treaties Likely to Facilitate or Hinder the Transition to
   Peace?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT & TRADE
AB This article seeks to explore how international investment treaties interact with the transition from armed conflict to peace. While the protection of foreign investors in conflict and post-conflict environments is a necessary requirement for re-establishing the rule of law and attracting new capital that is needed for rebuilding the wrecked economy, the threat of excessive arbitration claims may also complicate the delicate process of creating a stable political order. The article compares traditional, government-to-government methods of settling post-conflict international claims with investor-state arbitration. Unlike investors, governments will usually base their decision about raising a conflict-related claim on a number of extra-legal considerations, such as conditions for sustainable peace. These considerations will often reflect in the amount and the method of payment of post-conflict compensation. The article looks at the investment arbitration practice and identifies certain interpretive tools that take better account of post-conflict realities and lead to more balanced awards.

TI Policies and Programming for Safer Schools: Are "Anti-bullying"
   Approaches Impeding Education for Peacebuilding?
SO EDUCATIONAL POLICY
AB Prevailing anti-violence practices in public schools, especially in the context of recently increased emphasis on bullying, often allocate more resources to surveillance and control than to facilitation of healthy relationships or conflict/peace learning. This policy emphasis increases the risks of marginalization and reduces opportunities for diverse students to develop autonomy and mutual responsibility. This qualitative study examines educators' contrasting interpretations of various school safety and conflict management initiatives in practice, in peaceful and less peaceful schools serving stressed urban populations, and points out spaces for potential policy shifts and clarifications that could enhance sustainable peacebuilding in schools.

AB Drawing on resource-advantage and signalling theories, we investigate two mechanisms, namely corporate reputation and customer satisfaction, by which the environmental governance of enterprises can benefit their economic performance. Based on secondary data from the 500 largest US enterprises compiled from multiple sources, our findings contribute to the literature by establishing the link between corporate reputation and green reputation. We also establish the economic performance paths of environmental governance via corporate reputation and customer satisfaction. This study expounds on why green matters and identifies the performance roles of two corporate strategic resources extractable from the environmental governance of enterprises.

TI The Influence of War and Conflict on Infectious Disease: A Rapid Review
   of Historical Lessons We Have Yet to Learn
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Armed conflicts degrade established healthcare systems, which typically manifests as a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases. While 70% of deaths globally are now from non-communicable disease; in low-income countries, respiratory infections, diarrheal illness, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDs are all in the top 10 causes of death. The burden of these infectious diseases is exacerbated by armed conflict, translating into even more dramatic long-term consequences. This rapid evidence review searched electronic databases in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of 381 identified publications, 73 were included in this review. Several authors indicate that the impact of infectious diseases increases in wars and armed conflicts due to disruption to surveillance and response systems that were often poorly developed to begin with. Although the true impact of conflict on infectious disease spread is not known and requires further research, the link between them is indisputable. Current decision-making management systems are insufficient and only pass the baton to the next unwary generation.

TI Successful peace implementation: plans and processes
SO PEACEBUILDING
AB All peace agreements are flawed, to varying degrees, because mistrustful parties sign under pressure to end humanitarian suffering. They generally include what they can, leave out what cannot be settled, and gloss over differences in an effort to stop the killing. The peace implementation process, however, sometimes provides opportunities to strengthen weak agreements so that the peace process is strengthened from its initial, imperfect state. This article argues that peace implementation is more likely to lead to sustained peace if the process is flexible and prioritises the demilitarisation of politics. Implementation that follows a strict blueprint and prioritises making deadlines and milestones articulated in the agreement are likely to freeze in place the mal-distribution of power at the time the fighting stopped and consequently make sustainable peace more difficult.

TI Human rights and ethnic conflict management: The case of Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Against the background of the debate among scholars of human rights over whether group rights exist, and if they do, whether they are compatible with individual rights, this article tries to show that in divided multi-ethnic societies there is a need to balance the two kinds of rights. It approaches human rights from a conflict-management perspective and argues that there are interests and demands of a group nature which individual rights cannot satisfy and that, in fact, the observance of group rights is often a necessary condition for the enjoyment of individual rights. This is especially so in countries where there are deep and structural socio-economic and political cleavages among ethnic groups and where the state is not an autonomous agency or neutral umpire, as is assumed by liberal scholars. The underlying premise of the article is that human rights are neither natural nor given, and therefore that the kinds of rights demanded as well as the purposes for which they are demanded are often indicative of the kinds of balances that need to be made between individual and group rights. The article discusses the human rights approach to ethnic conflict management in Nigeria from these standpoints.

TI A healthy peace: public good provision and post-civil war peace

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The study of civil war recurrence is situated at the intersection of conflict and peacebuilding. These literatures focus on disparate definitions of peace. These literatures provide different explanations for variation in peace stability, and cover a large number of causal factors. We argue that these causal mechanisms are connected and conditioned by public policy. Specifically, we argue that the production and distribution of public goods post-conflict contribute to the maintenance of negative peace by acting as a credible commitment mechanism. In addition, public goods contribute to the building of positive peace when there is shared access to goods and services. We investigate the impact of public goods provision - measured as health funding and distribution - on causal mechanisms including opportunity, grievance, greed, and credible commitments. Using a duration model, we find that health spending, as a measure of public goods provision, is a strong predictor of the durability of peace after civil conflict.

TI No peace for the forest: Rapid, widespread land changes in the
   Andes-Amazon region following the Colombian civil war
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Negative environmental impacts of violent conflict have been observed worldwide. Whether or not active global conflicts are declining in number remains hotly debated, the number of countries entering post-conflict periods is on the rise, and the impact of this transition on land cover changes remains poorly understood. In Colombia, though large-scale armed conflict has concluded, the post-conflict period represents an ongoing threat to forest conservation, putting at risk commitments to meet global conservation goals and even those stipulated in the peace accord. This paper aims to assess land cover change associated with the Colombian conflict in the AndesAmazon region between 1988 and 2019. First, we use the Landsat archive to map land cover and characterize the spatial patterns of change at the regional level. Second, to empirically identify the effect of conflict on land cover change, we employ a difference-in-difference approach using local conflict events data. During conflict (1988-2011), land cover in the Andes-Amazon remained relatively stable, however during the post-conflict period (2012-2019), the conversion from forest to agriculture increased by 40%. We find that forest cover surrounding conflict events (1 km radius) decreased significantly, on average by - 19% during conflict, which accelerated to - 30% in the post-conflict period. Similarly, agriculture expansion is most substantial during the post-conflict period, but exclusively in municipalities with population below the 50th percentile. Landscape metrics show that in peripheral municipalities (<50th), agriculture occurs in clumped distributions during the conflict period. Meanwhile, during the post-conflict period, this expansion happens more quickly, with significantly greater agricultural patch sizes than during the conflict period. We conclude that a slow implementation of conservation governance, the emergence of illegal land markets, and illicit land uses (i.e., coca and illegal cattle ranching) may accelerate land cover change in the coming years.

TI Peacemaking in Burundi: Conflict Resolution versus Conflict Management
   Strategies
SO AFRICAN SECURITY
AB Peacemakers are faced with a difficult decision when engaging in negotiations to end conflict: should they adopt a conflict resolution strategy that seeks to address the fundamental drivers of conflict (root causes) or pursue a more limited strategy of conflict termination that seeks to respond to the symptoms of violence? This article investigates this question through a case study of the Burundian civil war of the 1990s. It analyzes externally facilitated peace negotiations in order to explore the types of issues that were brought into the process, to ask when and why certain issues were or were not considered, and to investigate the effects of the choices made in negotiating strategies. The lessons of the Burundi case suggest that fundamental issues must be addressed if a conflict is to be fully resolved rather than just managed. Delaying the resolution of root causes until after peacemakers have exited the situation can enable powerful groups to avoid addressing the issues. After the peacemaking and negotiations process ends, there is less international attention and pressure, so the ability to perpetuate the status quo is enhanced. The difficulty is that the issues that fomented conflict in the first place may prove too sensitive to be introduced into negotiations when the conflict is either ongoing or very recent.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND APPLIED CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB Human trafficking has been extensively discussed, studied and debated over the past 20 years, but many misleading images and stereotypes still exist regarding trafficking, its victims and its perpetrators. Trafficking is often framed as a problem of organised crime. The article problematises (1) the stereotypical images of perpetrators and (2) the involvement of organised crime in human trafficking, particularly in Finland, drawing on court cases that deal with trafficking in human beings. The article analyses, on the one hand, the characteristics of detected traffickers by reflecting the findings against the image of the ideal offender and, on the other hand, the role and involvement of organised crime in human trafficking. The article concludes that most convicted traffickers are not so-called ideal offenders. The variety of traffickers involved in the cases studied does not correspond very well to the rather stereotypical and oversimplified image of traffickers and ideal offenders.

SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB A large body of literature exists on the role of institutions in combating corruption and its influence on economic development. However, there is a paucity of literature on the inter-relationships between economic and political crises, institutions, and corruption. This paper addresses the question: how does institutional quality matter in affecting corruption during political and economic crises? To answer this question, we use a recently released historical panel dataset called V-Dem for over 130 countries during 1800-2020. The results suggest some heterogenous effects depending on the type of crisis and how we measure it. For example, strong institutions can control corruption in cases of political and civil violence and economic slowdown, but the effect disappears in other crises such as democracy breakdowns, coups, armed-conflict and civil-war and currency, inflation, and debt crisis. Furthermore, strong institutions in advanced economies prevent corruption in a significant way during political and civil violence.

TI From side show to centre stage: Civil conflict after the cold war
SO SECURITY DIALOGUE
AB The end of US-Soviet rivalry has given civil war a more prominent place in international politics, as well as in scholarship. The commonly held view that the world is currently in an era of more and increasingly savage civil conflict is, in part, a matter of increased attention to a problem that has long been with us. This article reviews recent research on the incidence of internal conflict. It finds that this literature calls into question assumptions of simple causal relationships between democratization, natural resources, ethnicity, and/or inequality and civil war. The most important area of consensus is that civil war, typical of weak states, is a problem of underdevelopment as well as politics.

TI Terrorism, Armed Conflict and Foreign Aid
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB Armed conflict, and to a lesser extent terrorism, have detrimental effect on economic and social development through destruction of human and physical capital and ensuing disruption to economic activity. There is also likely to be an indirect effect of political instability through its impact on foreign aid. The net effect is not obvious; violence may discourage aid donors and hence lead to a fall in received aid on the one hand, but it may well lead to an increase in foreign aid as donors offer reimbursement for counterterrorism efforts on the other hand. This paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments fighting terrorism. Nonetheless, these results do not hold for Muslim countries which do not receive increased aid when suffering from terrorism.

TI Ethical Advice: Conflict Management vs. Human Rights in Ending Civil
   Wars
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AB The theory of transitional justice, usually either war crimes tribunals and/or truth commissions, rests on the assumption that after internal conflict, societies must learn and accept the truth of what sort of violence has occurred in order to build a functioning, united society, and that any solution which omits such policies should be rejected. There is no empirical support for this assumption. Moreover, acting on it implies that civil war should be continued. Conflict resolution theory asserts that all major players, including those who have committed atrocities, must be involved in the settlement if it is to be stable. This seems a more appropriate strategy, especially when dealing with someone else's country and war.

TI Economics of Armed Conflicts and Governance: An Empirical Study Focusing
   on South Asia
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS JOURNAL
AB This study examines the effects of governance on armed conflict and the associations between economic factors, external finances (remittances), natural calamities, and armed conflicts. Panel data are used covering the South Asia region from 2002 to 2018, applying the logit and ARDL models. Based on the logit analysis, the results show that government effectiveness, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, and regulatory quality, the rule of law, and droughts/floods have a negative relationship with armed conflict. On the other hand, population, remittances, and voice and accountability have positive association with armed conflict. Based on ARDL estimations, government effectiveness, a proxy variable for governance, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, and the rule of law have negative and highly significant association with armed conflict. It is implied that good governance can reduce the likelihood of armed conflict, while population and remittances can fuel armed conflict. Moreover, natural calamities have an inverse relationship with armed conflict. Surprisingly, conflicts help increase the voice of and demand for accountability by general public in the conflict zone.

TI Climate finance governance: Fit for purpose?
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB This article consists of a critical review of the conceptual scholarship on the governance of climate finance and includes an overview of the institutional arrangements and governance logics that provide climate finance. New decentralized, polycentric structures allow for climate finance to more effectively reach the sub- and non-state actors most directly implementing climate change governance. However, the expansion of climate finance into market-inflected forms of blended finance, as well as debt-based financing, express a neoliberal logic that shifts power to market actors. This may challenge the efficacy of climate finance. We suggest that further research is needed on polycentric systems in climate finance, since an apparent expansion in the diversity of providers is also accompanied by a counter-intuitive concentration of decision-making power with financial fund managers. We join others in suggesting that the weight of scholarship advocates for a strong return to public authored finance and governance, under the auspices of Green New Deal programs and more widely.

TI Polarization and ethnic conflict in a widened strategic setting
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Ethnic groups and conflicts often transcend country borders, indicating that notions of relative strength and resolve may also surpass such borders. This study focuses on the association between ethnic polarization and conflict in a widened strategic environment, encapsulating each state that experiences ethnic conflict and its neighboring states, and involving contagion processes. Two claims are presented. First, when a state experiences ethnic conflict, neighboring states that are ethnically polarized are more likely to also experience ethnic conflict. Second, when a group involved in ethnic conflict has a kinship tie to a group in a neighboring state, the latter group is increasingly likely to be inspired to challenge the government and end up in ethnic conflict. This should be especially likely if the group resides in a state characterized by ethnic polarization. To evaluate these claims, this article employs logit regression on a global dataset covering the period from 1989 to 2004. The empirical analysis supports the first claim; polarized states are indeed associated with an increased likelihood of contagion processes. The findings also demonstrate that kinship links make contagion more likely; however, this effect is not conditioned by the level of ethnic polarization. The results are robust to a series of alternative specifications. In conclusion, these findings point to the importance of incorporating a widened strategic setting in the analysis when examining the association between ethnic polarization and civil conflict.

TI Governance and Capacity to Manage Resilience of Health Systems: Towards
   a New Conceptual Framework
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB The term resilience has dominated the discourse among health systems researchers since 2014 and the onset of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. There is wide consensus that the global community has to help build more resilient health systems. But do we really know what resilience means, and do we all have the same vision of resilience? The present paper presents a new conceptual framework on governance of resilience based on systems thinking and complexity theories. In this paper, we see resilience of a health system as its capacity to absorb, adapt and transform when exposed to a shock such as a pandemic, natural disaster or armed conflict and still retain the same control over its structure and functions.

SO SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE
AB Globally, millions of people are affected by war and conflicts every year. However, women have increasingly suffered the greatest harm by war in more different ways than men. We conceptualize a reproductive rights approach toward examining the effects of war on women's reproductive health in developing countries. Given the rising concerns of exclusion to adequately address women's rights, sexual and gender-based violence, and post-conflict accountability, we specifically focus on the limitations of the Minimum Initial Service Package, a UN-sponsored reproductive health service program in conflict zones while offering a broad reproductive rights-based conceptual lens for examining reproductive health care services in war-torn areas. In addition, we discuss the roles social workers may play at both micro and macro levels in war-torn areas to bring about both short term and long term gains in women's reproductive health.

However, the institutionality established by the 1991 Constitution and tendencies toward an authoritarian state exhibit not only tensions and conflicts, but also complementarities that are mutually reinforcing and have their roots in the weaknesses of a minimal national consensus to build a sustainable peace and a democracy that respond to the country's diverse ways of live.

Considering particular cases of ethnic conflict in which terrorist factions exist, the article argues that while neither conflict resolution nor counterterrorism alone can adequately address the problem, simultaneously conducting both must keep in mind the processes' inherent differences and avoid excessive prioritizing of one over the other. By exploring recent Turkish governmental initiatives to address the Kurdish question, the article attempts to provide an outline for how to successfully cope with the two processes simultaneously.

TI Revisiting democratic civil peace: Electoral regimes and civil conflict
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB The debate on democratic civil peace has centered on three general claims: democracies have a low risk of civil conflict, autocracies have the same low risk of conflict as democracies, and hybrid regimes have the highest conflict risk. We re-evaluate these claims, emphasizing that previous studies have focused on the aggregate categories of regimes, neglecting the role of particular institutional features. We propose focusing on the electoral qualities of regimes, which constitute the core of democracy, and argue that constraints on electoral contestation generate incentives for opposition to use force. Building on this framework, we distinguish between five regime types according to their electoral features - non-electoral autocracies, single-party autocracies, multi-party autocracies, minimalist democracies, and polyarchies - and specify hypotheses regarding the probability of conflict onset in each. In a global statistical analysis spanning 1817-2006 and employing the new Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy (LIED), we find that polyarchies, characterized by unconstrained contestation, have a lower probability of conflict than any other regime type (although minimalist democracies are only slightly more prone to conflict). Subsequently, we find that single- and multi-party autocracies, characterized by non-competitive elections, are more peaceful than non-electoral autocracies. Our analysis also reveals two factors that are particularly associated with civil peace: the presence of (any form of) elections and minimal electoral competition. Overall, our study underscores the importance of focusing on the central attributes of democracy and sheds new light on the relationship between particular regime features (or types) and civil conflict, thereby contributing to the growing efforts in conflict research to disaggregate political regimes.

TI Decentralized Environmental Governance: A reflection on its role in
   shaping Wildlife Management Areas in Tanzania
SO TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB Decentralised environmental governance has become a catchy solution to environmental problems caused by the failure of traditional centralised environmental governance. It promises to transfer power and authority, improve efficiency, equity, accountability, and inclusion of local people who were previously excluded by the command and control model. This paper examines the efficacy of decentralised environmental governance as an alternative approach to wildlife conservation in Tanzania. We analyse the policy and legal framework for Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Tanzania over the past two decades as a case study on current practice and its implications. We find that despite the rhetoric of community-based conservation (CBC), the wildlife industry remains heavily under state control, while the promises of CBC remain elusive. Questioning the effectiveness of decentralised environmental governance through CBC, we recommend that actors return to the drawing board and re-negotiate their positions, interests, power and authority if meaningfully decentralised environmental governance is to be achieved.

TI Climate-induced stressors to peace: a review of recent literature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Climate change is increasingly recognized as a threat to global peace and security. This paper intends to provide a better understanding of the nature of interactions between climate change and events that undermine peace through a systematic review of recent literature. It highlights major methodological approaches adopted in the literature, elaborates on the geographic focus of the research at the nexus of climate change and peace, and provides further information on how various climatic stressors, such as extreme temperature, floods, sea-level rise, storms, and water stress may be linked to different events that undermine peace (e.g. civil conflict, crime, intercommunal violence, interstate conflict, political conflict, and social conflict) through direct and indirect pathways. Results confirm previous findings that statistical techniques and qualitative case studies are dominant methods in climate-conflict research but show that there has been an increase in the geographic information system based risk analyses and qualitative comparative analyses in the recent years. In line with previous reviews, results show that the literature is mainly focused on certain regions of the world and several major regions that have experienced numerous conflicts over the past few years and/or are vulnerable to adverse climatic events are understudied. However, a new finding is that, in the past few years, there has been an increasing focus on Asia, which contrasts with previous reviews that show an African focus in the literature. Also, there is an unbalanced attention to different climatic stressors and peace-related events. Interactions between water stress/extreme temperature and civil and interstate conflicts have received more attention. A major finding is that, only under certain conditions climatic stressors may act as driving forces or aggravating factors. In fact, there is a strong consensus that climate change is less likely to undermine peace in isolation from a wide range of contextual socio-economic and institutional factors such as political instability, poor governance, poverty, homogeneous livelihood structures, and ethnic fractionalization. However, such contextual factors can contribute to undermining peace via either direct or indirect pathways. The former may occur through direct psychological/physiological effects of climatic impacts or via competition over scarce resources. In contrast, in indirect pathways climate change may lead to conflict through diminishing livelihood capacities and/or inducing migration. In addition to synthesizing literature on contextual factors and direct/indirect pathways, the review identifies gaps that need further research.

TI Local Public Goods Expenditure and Ethnic Conflict: Evidence from China
SO SECURITY STUDIES
AB Few civil-conflict studies explore the role played by subnational-level governments, especially the impact of their providing public goods. In this paper, I argue that local governments can mitigate the risk of ethnic conflicts by increasing their provision of public goods. I situate this argument in the context of ongoing ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang, China. With a new data set of 105 ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang between 1997 and 2005, this study finds that counties with higher government spending on education were significantly less likely to experience conflicts. The results are robust to a wide range of robustness checks.

ACLED codes the actions of rebels, governments, and militias within unstable states, specifying the exact location and date of battle events, transfers of military control, headquarter establishment, civilian violence, and rioting. In the current version, the dataset covers 50 unstable countries from 1997 through 2010. ACLED's disaggregation of civil war and transnational violent events allow for research on local level factors and the dynamics of civil and communal conflict. Findings from subnational conflict research challenges conclusions from larger national-level studies. In a brief descriptive analysis, the authors find that, on average, conflict covers 15% of a state's territory, but almost half of a state can be directly affected by internal wars.

TI Determinants of Colombian attitudes toward the peace process
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB A critical element that is often overlooked when studying negotiations in civil wars is popular support for the peace process itself. This is particularly important when agreements are subject to ratification by the broader population, as was the case in the Colombian conflict with the FARC. Using survey data from 2014, we find that attitudes toward this peace process were driven by political preferences more than conflict experiences. Some demographic traits (education, religion, and rural residency) were also important. Notably, these determinants of support for talks with the FARC map closely onto voting patterns in the October 2016 plebiscite.

TI Blood and Soil? Resource Scarcity and Internal Armed Conflict Revisited
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Scarcity of renewable resources is frequently argued to be a main driver of violent conflict. The 2004 and 2007 Nobel Peace Prize awards, as well as the international debate about the implications of climate change, show the salience of the topic as a security issue. Studies testing the link between renewable resource scarcity and armed conflict have reached diverging conclusions. One study, in particular, has found substantial support for eco-scarcity theory, while most others have found a limited association. This article starts with an attempt at replicating earlier findings on the link between population density, soil degradation, deforestation, water scarcity and civil war, but several results are not replicable. The final results lend little support to a purported link between resource scarcity and civil conflict, whereas it replicates earlier findings on the importance of poverty, instability and dependence of fuel exports. A high level of land degradation is the only factor that significantly increases the risk of civil conflict, although this result should be interpreted with caution. The general conclusion of this study is that scarcity of natural resources has limited explanatory power in terms of civil violence, whereas poverty and dysfunctional institutions are robustly related to conflict. Future studies on the link between resource scarcity and violent conflict should focus on local and less intense conflicts, pay more attention to a context of low economic development, look more thoroughly into the role of state actors in the escalatory phase of conflict and assess the importance of the distribution of resources relative to scarcity per se.

TI Participation in environmental conservation and protected area
   management in Romania: A review of three case studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB Since the collapse of Central and Eastern Europe's communist regimes in the early 1990s, the ensuing environmental, social and economic changes have permitted development of new forms of multi-level governance. However, a coherent participatory approach to environmental conservation is yet to emerge. This review examines the changing approaches in environmental conservation and protected area governance in Romania during the country's pre-communist, communist, transition and current European Union eras. Three case examples are examined in depth to assess how changing environmental governance is playing out in practice in Natura 2000 sites, in a national park, and on privately owned (unprotected) forest land. Similar to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Romania's environmental governance practices still face substantial challenges in consolidating an inclusive and integrated approach to environmental governance and conservation. A lack of historical involvement of communities in decision making, reluctance within government to drive forward more inclusive environmental governance approaches, and a lack of non-governmental organizations focusing on environmental conservation, have resulted in slow progress towards more inclusive environmental governance. Civil society and solutions for institutionalizing participation across all levels of governance are needed to reorient environmental governance towards a more inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach that better links economic, social and environmental objectives.

TI The wedding bells of war: The influence of armed conflict on child
   marriages in West Africa
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Child marriage is a fundamental violation of human rights. It hinders progress towards development and public health goals. In this study, we argue that armed conflict plays an important role in the occurrence of child marriages; it influences the supply of and demand for young brides. We argue that in conflict settings, families are more willing to marry off their young daughters for protection. Armed conflict can also influence the demand: marriage in general declines due to an imbalance in sex ratio. However, in cases where belligerents use war tactics specifically focused on harming girls, such as sexual violence and girl recruitment, early marriage might increase as the result of armed conflict. To empirically examine these linkages, we combine the Demographic and Health Surveys of West Africa with information on the location of armed conflict. Our study shows that armed conflict generally reduces the occurrence of child marriage with 13% to 18%. However, we observe that when conflict actors use war tactics that specifically harm young girls there is a significant increase of 12% to 18% in the probability of a girl getting married before the age of 18. This research has important implications for our understanding of the relationship between armed conflict, gender inequality, and their impact on children.

TI PEACE PROCESSES AND IDP SOLUTIONS
SO REFUGEE SURVEY QUARTERLY
AB The forcible uprooting of people is an inevitable consequence of armed conflict. The processes by which peace agreements are negotiated and implemented will determine whether and under what conditions internally displaced persons (IDPs) will return home or whether other solutions will be necessary or possible. If countries newly emerging from conflict are able to find durable solutions for IDPs and other war-affected populations, it is a significant bellwether for the success of the overall peace process. IDP concerns arise most visibly in the humanitarian practices of government and insurgent parties prior to the conclusion of an overall peace agreement. Subsequently, the language in peace agreements about procedures for refugee returns also encompasses IDP questions. Over the long term, the integration of IDPs depends on the local, regional, and national implementation of agreed principles. International monitoring of local implementation is weak at best.

TI Paying attention to pigs: negotiating equity and equality in global
   environmental governance in Suau, Papua New Guinea
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
AB The idea of 'equity', largely grounded in Western legal tradition, has come to permeate evaluations of what is fair and just within environmental governance programmes. But what constitutes equity in climate change and conservation projects? And does everyone affected by such projects see equity as desirable? Local encounters with global environmental governance interventions in Suau, Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea, provide an entry point to explore these questions. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with communities implicated in the Central Suau Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) Pilot Project and in Save the Forest conservation projects, we examine tensions around conceptions of equity and equality between project proponents and local communities, as well as between individuals within those communities. By paying attention to talk about pigs in Suau, and tracing the intersections between reciprocity and trade, we explore how people negotiate equity and equality. We emphasize that this negotiation is central to Suau ideas of fairness. While the REDD+ and Save the Forest projects work to ensure 'equitable' distribution of benefits among supposedly equivalent actors, we show how this may actually close down possibilities for negotiation of outcomes that local people consider fair.

TI Payments for ecosystem services within the hybrid governance model:
   evaluating policy alignment and complementarity on California rangelands
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Governance of global natural resources is increasingly hybrid, with complementary public and private sector initiatives layered on landscapes to improve environmental outcomes. The challenge of polycentric land use governance is alignment of goals across diverse governance mechanisms when agricultural producers, public agencies, and corporations have distinct motivations. This case study of soil carbon governance on California rangelands explores a new payment for ecosystem services (PES) initiative led by the food and agriculture industry, called the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC). Applying hybrid governance theory to agricultural lands, we conduct an ex-ante policy evaluation of potential policy impact based on (i) alignment between corporate sustainability goals and ranchers' priorities and (ii) complementarity of the ESMC market with existing public and private policies enabling rangeland conservation. We found corporations developing the PES market to be motivated by carbon insetting, the objectives of which converge with ranchers' goals of preserving soils. Each policy offers distinct benefits and challenges, with synergies around climate change adaptation and soil health. As a new policy tool, carbon markets like the ESMC are positioned to meet demand for soil health financing, support resilience and ranch productivity, and improve ranchers' access to soil health data for adaptive management. Given carbon markets' outcome-based payment structure, we highlight the importance of complementary governance mechanisms that mitigate upfront risk with financial and technical support during the transition period, including Farm Bill cost-share programs and private sector financing tools. This policy evaluation highlights the challenges and opportunities surrounding rangelands soil carbon governance, particularly the trade-offs that ranchers, corporations, and society at large must consider for landscape-scale conservation programs.

TI Effects of armed conflict on child health and development: A systematic
   review
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Armed conflicts affect more than one in 10 children globally. While there is a large literature on mental health, the effects of armed conflict on children's physical health and development are not well understood. This systematic review summarizes the current and past knowledge on the effects of armed conflict on child health and development.
   Methods
   A systematic review was performed with searches in major and regional databases for papers published 1 January 1945 to 25 April 2017. Included studies provided data on physical and/or developmental outcomes associated with armed conflict in children under 18 years. Data were extracted on health outcomes, displacement, social isolation, experience of violence, orphan status, and access to basic needs. The review is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017036425.
   Findings
   Among 17,679 publications screened, 155 were eligible for inclusion. Nearly half of the 131 quantitative studies were case reports, chart or registry reviews, and one-third were cross-sectional studies. Additionally, 18 qualitative and 6 mixed-methods studies were included. The papers describe mortality, injuries, illnesses, environmental exposures, limitations in access to health care and education, and the experience of violence, including torture and sexual violence. Studies also described conflict-related social changes affecting child health. The geographical coverage of the literature is limited. Data on the effects of conflict on child development are scarce.
   Interpretation
   The available data document the pervasive effect of conflict as a form of violence against children and a negative social determinant of child health. There is an urgent need for research on the mechanisms by which conflict affects child health and development and the relationship between physical health, mental health, and social conditions. Particular priority should be given to studies on child development, the long term effects of exposure to conflict, and protective and mitigating factors against the harmful effects of armed conflict on children.

TI Trauma awareness and preparedness: Their influence on posttraumatic
   stress disorder development related to armed conflict experience
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY IN AFRICA
AB This study examined influences of trauma awareness and preparedness on the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in civilian and military personnel with exposure to the civil war. Participants were 302 people with exposure to civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (civilians = 68%; females = 47%; age range = 16 to 76 years old, SD = 13.58 years). Participants completed the Posttraumatic Checklist Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Traumatic Events List. The data were analysed to predict PTSD development from trauma awareness and preparedness, taking exposure to multiple traumas into account as a risk factor. Findings suggest that trauma awareness and preparedness play an important role among military personnel in moderating the risk of developing PTSD, more so than among the civilian population. Mental health professionals working with civil war survivors should seek to explore trauma awareness and preparedness as resources for minimising risk for PTSD in armed conflict situations.

TI The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict will push back the sustainable
   development goals
SO GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is a dramatic world event. Apart from the loss of life, the present conflict has tremendous impacts on the environment, economy, and society. The conflict provoked a ripple of events with implications at the global level, especially in energy and food. The escalation of this conflict is imposing severe threats to achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) not only to the countries directly involved in the conflict but also to other countries, especially the developing ones that are more vulnerable to the economic crisis. In this editorial, we assessed the impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on Biophysical SDGs, Social SDGs, Economic SDGs and Partnership for the Goals SDG that consider all the previous dimensions. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict's impact on the SDGs is variable. Biodiversity SDGs are mainly affected at the regional level (Russia, Ukraine, surrounding and European Union countries). Society SDGs are affected at local (e.g., SDG3 good health and wellbeing; SDG4 quality education) and global (e.g., SDG2 zero hunger) levels. Finally, the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has world-level implications for the economic SDGs. Nevertheless, the ongoing conflict's impacts are not entirely understood, and several uncertainties exist. Peace is needed to achieve the UN's SDGs in 2030.

AB Purpose:
   The purpose of this study is to identify new types of organised crime, and create a new conceptual framework for dealing with the most dangerous type- institutional organised crime.
   Design/methodology/approach:
   The studies take a systematic and qualitative approach. The research is founded on the author's long-term survey based on the statistical indications and 37 in-depth interviews with officials.
   Findings:
   Five types of organised crime were identified. Besides well-known types of organised crime, this study found two new types of organised crime: institutional and institutionalised organised crime. This new typology distinguishes from the previous typologies.
   Originality/value:
   One of the main points of this study is finding a solution for an exceedingly high rate of institutional organised crime. For that purpose, this study found that the problem might be resolved if the legal system will foresee foundation of an optimal independent institution against institutional type of organised crime which is inseparably linked with high type of corruption. An optimal independent institution would be independent from the government, but not from wide social control. This solution is guided by the knowledge that though all governments in the world have huge power, the governments in the fragile societies have a high concentration of power. The developed countries with traditional democracy, political culture and awareness of the law can deal with this problem. But in the same transitional and undeveloped countries, there is a lack of such determinative factors and the governments are really the dominant generator of institutional organised crime.

TI Adverse Rainfall Shocks and Civil War: Myth or Reality?
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB News reports and policymakers frequently link African civil conflicts and wars to agricultural crises caused by droughts. However, empirical studies of the relationship between rainfall and civil conflict or war remain inconclusive. I reexamine this relationship focusing on rainfall over each country's agricultural land during the growing seasons. I also incorporate that the relationship between rainfall and agricultural output is hump-shaped, as rainfall beyond a threshold decreases output. I find a U-shaped relationship between rainfall and the risk of civil conflict and war in (Sub-Saharan) African countries. This relationship mirrors the hump-shaped relationship between rainfall and agricultural output.

TI Metadata Retention as a Means of Combatting Terrorism and Organised
   Crime: A Perspective from Australia
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB On October 13, 2015, new laws came into force in Australia requiring telecommunications service providers to retain and store their 'metadata' for 2 years so that it remains available for analysis by anti-terrorism strategists and organised crime fighters. But there are ongoing issues associated with this legislative approach, including the threats to privacy thereby, and concerns that the retention system can be circumvented entirely. This paper will outline the legal and criminological questions that need to be explored in order to help policymakers work through these issues so that an appropriate balance can be struck between forestalling crime and terrorism using all available electronic means, and not unduly curtailing the legitimate rights to privacy that citizens in modern democracies currently expect to enjoy.

TI External Interventions in Post-Cold War Africa, 1989-2010
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB The study of external interventions in conflict management is critical and has implications for international relations and conflict theory. Quantitative studies of the relationship between external interventions and civil war have been prone to some conceptual limitations (understudied lower-intensity periods) and data limitations (unavailability of event battle death data). This article presents a new external interventions data set covering the period between 1989 and 2010 for Africa, building on the Regan et al. (2009) data set, which covers the period between 1945 and 1999. Novel features of this new data set are: the recoding of the overlap period; a broader range of categories of intervention, including UN and non-UN missions; and wider temporal scope, by extending the period of analysis to 2010, by lowering the civil war threshold to 25 battle deaths, and by starting the conflict period from the date of the first battle death in each civil war (based on UCDP GED version-1.5-2011). The advantages of the data set are illustrated with an analysis of the different effects interventions have on high-and low-intensity conflict periods.

TI Relative rebel strength and the onset and outcome of civil war mediation
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB To what extent does the relative strength of a rebel movement impact upon the likelihood of a peace settlement in civil conflict? This article argues that relatively stronger rebels are more likely to overcome the strategic bargaining problems that can prevent the resolution of war. Relatively strong insurgents are better equipped to significantly challenge core government interests and fundamentally threaten the survival of a regime. The incumbent's fear of future violence therefore makes mediation more likely to be undertaken in high-stakes conflicts between states and strong rebel groups. Relatively strong insurgencies are also those with the greatest leverage to negotiate enforcement mechanisms and the best equipped to defend themselves in the event that the government reneges on an agreement. This reduces the scale of the commitment problem and increases the probability of relatively strong rebel groups agreeing to a settlement with an incumbent. This argument is tested using dyadic data that capture the relative position of insurgents in civil war from 1946 to 2004. This represents an important methodological shift within the mediation literature, which has in the past largely relied upon aggregate country-level data. The results suggest that relatively stronger insurgents are more likely to force the state to open a mediation process and eventually concede some form of settlement. This is further evidence of the need to capture the dyadic relations between actors with fine-grained disaggregated data.

TI The New, Green, Urbanization in China: Between Authoritarian
   Environmentalism and Decentralization
SO CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Orthodox Western environmental practice and its associated discourse posits a positive causal link between levels of participation and effective environmental governance and regards participatory practices as a normatively desirable element in the building of a more sustainable society. However, recent discussions around theories of authoritarian environmentalism have challenged some basic assumptions of orthodox environmentalism. However, these discussions still lack sufficient discussion of real-world policy making and implementation and this article addresses that gap by exploring China's policy of green urbanization, deemed a top priority by Chinese policy elites. We argue that the shifting strategies of governance associated with green urbanization are evidence of the emergence of a distinct paradigm of authoritarian environmentalism, characterized by a re-centralization of state power and a reduction of local autonomy, in environmental policy making in China.

In the second and central part of the article, the integrated framework is applied to Guatemala, trying to understand causes and functions of war and negotiation and underlining the existence of structural obstacles to a lasting peace. The conclusions are dedicated to policy implications: if the signing of peace accords represents only, a step towards negative peace, the condition for a lasting peace is a strategy for reconciliation and development based on social participation and social justice.

TI The Effect of Environmental Regulation on Corporate Environmental
   Governance Behavior and Its Mechanisms
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environmental regulation is an institutional guarantee for achieving green and sustainable economic development, and the implementation effect of environmental regulation policies is a concern for all sectors of society. This paper empirically examines the impact of environmental regulation on firms' environmental governance behavior using a double difference model with the help of a quasi-natural experiment, the new Environmental Protection Law, and analyzes the mediating effect of central environmental protection inspectors using data from listed companies in China from 2011 to 2020. It was found that environmental regulation significantly enhances firms' motivation to participate in environmental governance and central environmental protection inspectors play a mediating role in the impact of environmental regulation on firms' environmental governance behavior. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis shows that the enhancement effect of environmental regulation on firms' environmental governance behavior mainly exists in large-scale firms and nonstate enterprises.

TI Horizontal inequalities, political violence, and nonviolent conflict
   mobilization: A review of the literature
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS
AB The association between horizontal inequalities (HIs) and civil war is well established. Yet, studies of HIs and civil war rarely specify why HIs should lead to conflict that is violent, organized, and large-scale, such as civil war. Collective mobilization outside conventional political channels could take many other forms, such as demonstrations, strikes, riots or communal conflicts. Recently, researchers have begun to investigate whether HIs increase the risk of nonviolent, less organized, and smaller-scale conflict. This article provides the first systematic review of the emerging quantitative literature on the impact of HIs on both violent and nonviolent conflict mobilization. We ask: Do HIs increase all mobilization outside conventional political channels, or do they shape what form of conflict breaks out? We supplement previous reviews of the literature on HIs and political violence with a systematic update for scholarly articles published in 2017-2022. This yielded 22 new articles. Furthermore, we identify 20 articles on HIs and nonviolent conflict published in 1996-2022. The review reveals that while there is robust evidence on the relationship between HIs and violent mobilization, the emerging evidence on nonviolent conflict is inconsistent. We conclude by discussing potential reasons for this inconsistency.

TI Reproductive Health for Conflict-Affected Displaced Women in Nigeria: An
   Intersectionality-Based Critical Ethnography Study
SO REFUGEE SURVEY QUARTERLY
AB Nigeria is a significant contributor to the global forcibly displaced population. The majority of this displacement is related to Boko Haram and herdsmen attacks in Northern Nigeria. A growing body of research has started to investigate issues surrounding protection concerns for the internally displaced who have been uprooted by these uprisings and attacks. Importantly, research is also starting to engage with issues of sexual violence and unwanted pregnancies associated with the conflict and displacement. This article aims to develop this work further by examining intersecting factors shaping the reproductive health experiences of women internally displaced by the Boko Haram and Herdsmen crisis in Northern Nigeria. To this end, a critical ethnography study involving in-depth interviews with 29 internally displaced women and five service providers in Northern Nigeria was completed between May 2019 to September 2019. Three major intersected subjects pertaining to women's reproductive health access were observed. These were: (1) normative perceptions and the prevalence of urogenital infections; (2) decisions made on birthplaces and number of births; (3) income and accessibility to care. The findings illustrate the interrelated economic and sociocultural factors that constrain access to reproductive health for internally displaced women.

It emphasises the need for a substantially enhanced capacity of prosecution services to investigate and prosecute serious crimes and examines some promising strategies for building or strengthening that capacity. Modern prosecution services, with their emphasis on sound case management practices, strategic planning, performance based standards, effective use of modern technologies and sustained cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, both domestically and internationally, are indeed very different from their predecessors.

TI Organised crime and international aid subversion: evidence from Colombia
   and Afghanistan
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Scholarly attempts to explain aid subversion in post-conflict contexts frame the challenge in terms of corrupt practices and transactions disconnected from local power struggles. Also, they assume a distinction between organised crime and the state. This comparative analysis of aid subversion in Colombia and Afghanistan reveals the limits of such an approach. Focusing on relations that anchor organised crime within local political, social and economic processes, we demonstrate that organised crime is dynamic, driven by multiple motives and endogenous to local power politics. Better understanding of governance arrangements around the organised crime-conflict nexus which enables aid subversion is therefore required.

TI MULTIPLE PATHS TO PEACE: PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FOR TRANSFORMATIVE AND
   SUSTAINABLE PEACE PROCESES
SO KULTUR-REVISTA INTERDISCIPLINARIA SOBRE LA CULTURA DE LA CIUTAT
AB Mainstream peacemaking is dominated by the assumption that peace is forged at a negotiating table and that a peace agreement will deliver change for the better. But reality suggests a different picture. With limited ownership and legitimacy most peace agreements collapse, and when they don't their record of implementation remains frustratingly low. This article suggests the need to develop innovative thinking and practice to allow more effective and sustainable peace processes. There is a need for a change of paradigm: to demystify the negotiating table as the core space for deliberation and decision-making and more explicitly acknowledge the importance of parallel or alternative more inclusive spaces and processes of dialogue and agreements on the structural change that will bring transformative peace for society at large. Peace negotiations may be essential for a peace process, but a peace process needs to involve actors and trigger discussions beyond the negotiating table. There are multiple paths to peace, all of them important.

TI Disaggregating actors in intranational conflict
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB While some of the intrastate war literature calls for the disaggregation of civil conflict, most of those studies focus on the geography of civil conflict failing to take into account the various actors involved in such conflicts. This study addresses the multi-actor nature of civil conflict by examining whether 'actor aggregation' affects the inferences drawn from quantitative studies of civil conflict. Using two cases, Cambodia (1980-2004) and Indonesia (1980-2004), the authors examine how multiple dissident groups' behavior aggregated together can affect the inferences drawn from quantitative studies of government-dissident interactions. The results demonstrate that researchers may draw different inferences and commit both Type I and Type II errors using different actor aggregations. The results have myriad implications for the study of civil conflict and conflict processes.

   countries
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Objective To assess associations between national characteristics, including governance indicators, with a proxy for universal health coverage in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH).
   Design Ecological analysis based on data from national standardised cross-sectional surveys.
   Setting Low-income and middle-income countries with a Demographic and Health Survey or a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey since 2005.
   Participants 1 246 710 mothers and 2 129 212 children from 80 national surveys.
   Exposures of interest Gross domestic product (GDP), country surface area, population, Gini index and six governance indicators (control of corruption, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability).
   Main outcomes Levels and inequality in the composite coverage index (CCI), a weighted average of eight RMNCH interventions. Relative and absolute inequalities were measured through the concentration index (CIX) and slope index of inequality (SII) for CCI, respectively.
   Results The average values of CCI (70.5% (SD=13.3)), CIX (5.3 (SD=5.1)) and mean slope index (19.8 (SD=14.7)) were calculated. In the unadjusted analysis, all governance variables and GDP were positively associated with the CCI and negatively with inequalities. Country surface showed inverse associations with both inequality indices. After adjustment, among the governance indicators, only political stability and absence of violence was directly related to CCI (beta=6.3; 95% CI 3.6 to 9.1; p<0.001) and inversely associated with relative (CIX; beta=-1.4; 95% CI -2.4 to -0.4; p=0.007) and absolute (SII; beta=-5.3; 95% CI -8.9 to -1.7; p=0.005) inequalities. The strongest associations with governance indicators were found in the poorest wealth quintile. Similar patterns were observed for GDP. Country surface area was inversely related to inequalities on CCI.
   Conclusions Levels and equity in RMNCH interventions are positively associated with political stability and absence of violence, and with GDP, and inversely associated with country surface area.

TI Globalization and corruption in post-Soviet countries: perverse effects
   of economic openness
SO EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS
AB Post-Soviet countries struggle with endemic problems of corruption. While the causes of corruption are many and deeply rooted, one of the factors that may contribute to corruption is globalization. The influence of international economic ties on bureaucratic corruption is frequently overlooked. It is also significant for those interested in addressing corruption because it could potentially be dealt with through straightforward policy change. Economic transition led to significant increases in foreign investment and trade in post-Soviet countries. This article examines bureaucratic corruption by considering the variation in firms' tendency to pay bribes in each country using self-reported data from surveys of enterprises in 11 post-Soviet countries. Within the context of the same legal and political institutions and cultural environment, trading firms are more likely than non-trading firms to make informal payments to get things done. This is attributable to payments made to deal with customs officials; there is little correlation between trade and bribery for dealing with inspections, taxes, or other types of obstacles. Foreign direct investment does not generally lower the incidence of bribery. However, if the investment's home country has substantially better control of corruption than does the host country, those firms are less likely to engage in bribery. Finally, firms that report greater pressure from foreign competitors are sometimes more likely to pay bribes, indicating that the increased competitiveness of the global market is not always sufficient to crowd out corruption, but rather increases it.

TI Categorising the crime-terror nexus in the European Union
SO GLOBAL CRIME
AB For the past 10 years, the crime- terror nexus has been used as an analytical model to understand the relationship between organised crime and terrorism in many of the world's (post) conflict and developing countries. Yet, aside from tangent and anecdotal evidence, little academic research has tried to understand how the nexus operates from within Western democracies and the implications that such internal relationships have on its social and economic security. Evidence related to these linkages in the European Union are immense; however, scholarly literature has shied away from these associations and turned their focus primarily on the nexus in more unstable regions, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia. This article-based on a study funded by the European Parliament in 2013- provides a qualitative analysis of the crime- terror nexus as it functions in Europe (including its border regions) to determine the operational structure of the nexus as well as where and how linkages between organised crime and terrorism interact. Indeed, organised criminal and terrorist groups have found niches of cooperation and 'marriages of convenience' in the EU's social and political landscape to operate in an efficient and effective manner. Evidence suggests that, although the nexus model provides a sound assessment of these relationships, the proclivities of the region (a relatively stable socio- economic and political environment) keep the relationship between organised crime and terrorism on one end of the spectrum, focusing on alliances, appropriation of tactics, and integration. Moreover, the EU's relationship to its regional borders and the operational incentives for organised crime and terrorism in these areas, provide ample opportunities for a convergence of organised crime and terrorist financing.

TI Identity and Peace: Reconfiguring Conflict Resolution in Africa
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB The emergence of intra-state wars based on identity requires a reconfiguring of existing conflict resolution mechanisms. The article recognises the limitations of liberal peace models originally configured to deal with inter-state conflicts, but increasingly applied to inter-ethnic conflicts with limited success and often disastrous effects. The article argues for the reconceptualisation of identities as building blocks of sustainable peace, justice and reconciliation. The article also calls for the recognition of the role of regional peace and security mechanisms in conflict resolution, as far as possible the use of traditional justice mechanisms, especially in the context of increasing state failure on the continent. The article cautions against enthusiastic embrace of international justice mechanisms that may sometimes create stumbling blocks to peace and reconciliation. Rather the article suggests nuanced interventions in identity-based conflicts that reconcile democracy and justice, guaranteeing the rights of both majority and minority groups.

TI 'No peace, no war' proponents? How pro-regime militias affect civil war

SO COOPERATION AND CONFLICT
AB Previous research on non-state actors involved in civil wars has tended to disregard the role of extra-dyad agents in influencing conflict outcomes. Little is known as to whether the presence of such extra-dyadic actors as pro-regime militias affects conflict termination and outcomes. This article develops and tests a number of hypotheses on the pro-government militias' effect upon civil war outcomes. It proposes that pro-regime militias involved in intrastate conflicts tend to act as proponents of 'no peace, no war', favouring low-activity violence and ceasefires over other conflict outcomes. These hypotheses are examined using an expanded dataset on pro-government militias and armed conflict in a statistical analysis of 229 civil war episodes from 1991 to 2015. These findings shed new light on the role of extra-state actors in civil wars.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Increasingly, environmental sustainability-governance research investigates procedural justice, which is focused on fairness, discrimination, and inclusion in decision-making. To understand the (re)production of inequity and environmental injustice, we must examine who is included and excluded, what types of knowledge and information are incorporated, and how more inclusive processes may (not) facilitate transformation of environmental governance. A growing empirical literature explores the potential of shadow networks to expand inclusion in governance arenas. Shadow networks work inside and outside the dominant system, facilitate information flows, create nodes of expertize, identify knowledge gaps, engage in social learning, and explore alternatives to the status quo, yet some shadow networks reinforce historic legacies of injustice exacerbating exclusion and centering particular actors or communities.

TI What Makes State Leaders Brutal? Examining Grievances and Mass Killing
   during Civil War
SO CIVIL WARS
AB What makes state leaders enmeshed in civil war commit mass killings against their own populations? This article explores this question by synthesizing grievances and mass killing. It investigates how factors or contexts that breed or exacerbate grievances can trigger state-sponsored mass killing during civil war. Severe political and economic marginalization and a history of intense armed conflict can engender staunch civilian support for insurgents, which prompts embattled rulers to orchestrate mass killing as a strategy of neutralizing insurgent combatants and warding off future rebellion. To verify this argument, a dataset is constructed that contains information on civil wars from 1945 to 2007 and large-N statistical analyses are conducted. The results corroborate the author's theoretical arguments with respect to political marginalization and history of armed conflict, but not with respect to economic marginalization. The argument and findings suggest that (1) grievances account for mass killing perpetrated by the government during civil war and (2) different sources of grievances have varying effects on mass killing.

How 'environment' is represented is as critical as how environmental crisis is managed. This essay addresses a debate of this kind by considering the complementary and contradictory relations between the concepts of 'multi-functionality' and 'food sovereignty,' as they define the global landscape. The juxtaposition of these concepts and their practical implications for political economy and ecology has its formative origins in a European-led debate over the role of agriculture, as a critical dimension of environmental governance.

TI Forgotten Conflicts: Producing Knowledge and Ignorance in Security
   Studies
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB Security studies privileges the study of civil wars in some contexts over others. The field's leading journals mostly publish studies of armed conflicts in Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Armed conflicts in Asia receive comparatively little attention, despite their prevalence and protracted nature. Against the background of our own empirical archive-the decades-old but largely ignored civil war in Myanmar-we ask why some conflicts draw more scholarly interest than others and why this uneven attention matters. In doing so, we argue that the empirical selectivity bias in the study of civil war and armed conflict reflects (1) institutional entanglements between the field of security studies and Western foreign policy; and (2) sociological factors that shape the formation of scholarly subjectivities and pertain to methodological challenges. This uneven empirical landscape shapes our conceptual understanding of civil wars. In fact, prominent debates within leading security studies journals surrounding the nature of civil war and armed conflict are inseparable from the empirical contexts in which they emerged. Leveling such an uneven empirical landscape thus generates opportunities for discussing conflict, insecurity, and violence in a different light. In shedding light on this issue, we urge closer attention to questions of place, time, and power in the scholarly production of knowledge and ignorance.

TI Another civil war in South Sudan: the failure of Guerrilla Government?
SO JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Popular explanations for the outbreak of a new civil war in South Sudan have centred on ethnic factors and leadership personalities. This article demonstrates that the conflict is rooted in deep cleavages within the ruling political party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). When internal tensions came to a head in late 2013, a combination of neopatrimonial politics, a weak state structure and legacies of violence from the previous civil war allowed this to escalate into a full-scale armed conflict.

TI The tragedy of the cocoa pod: rent-seeking, land and ethnic conflict in
   Ivory Coast
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Many people have been surprised by the eruption of ethnic conflict and civil war in Ivory Coast. The country had gained a reputation as a relatively stable and economically prosperous agricultural republic in a region known for ethnic conflict, economic decline and civil war. The underlying factors that have led to the ethnic violence, the flight of immigrants from neighbouring countries, and the division of the country into a predominantly Muslim north and largely Christian south have been known for some time. The country's property rights regime that encouraged easy access to a forest rent - as long as cheap migrant labour and virgin forested land were available - was a recipe for future conflict. As available land declined and labour costs increased, a cycle of sharpening conflicts over these assets contributed to the current situation of ethno-regional division and civil war.

TI Civil War Mediation and Rebel Use of Violence Against Civilians
SO ARMED FORCES & SOCIETY
AB Violence against civilians is portrayed as an antecedent of civil war, a cause, or both. Civil war creates opportune environments for planning and carrying out these acts that in turn can have detrimental effects on peace processes. Since not all civil war factions will see peace as beneficial, some actors may use violence to undermine the peace talks. The rebels may use indiscriminate violence to demonstrate their ability to exact costs on the government thus forcing the latter to negotiate. This article focuses upon acts of violence committed by rebel groups during mediated peace process. The central hypothesis is that violence against civilians increases the probability of mediation that in turn increases the prospects for violence. Using all civil war episodes from 1970 to 2008 as observations results from bivariate probit analysis endogenizing the choice of mediation bear out this theoretical argument.

TI Yemen: Cholera outbreak and the ongoing armed conflict
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB Yemen was affected by a major cholera epidemic in 2016, while a civil war, which has devastated the country since March 2015, has exacerbated the humanitarian situation. Cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholera, thus this study aims to analyze the epidemiological features of the outbreak and explore the relation of the outbreak to the current armed conflict situation.
   The data were obtained from the national surveillance system in Yemen. This contains details of 15,074 cases registered as suspected cholera patients per governorate from week 39 to 52 in 2016. In addition to the data concerning cholera, other data on conflict-related injuries, and population movement (numbers of Internally Displaced Persons - IDPs-and number of displaced returnees) were used to assess the correlation using Spearman's rho analysis.
   The data analysis shows the intensity of the conflict as measured by the total casualties per governorate (conflict-related injuries and death) is significantly correlated with the number of cholera cases per governorate (r 0.483, P = 0.026). The analysis also shows a positive, but not significant correlation between cholera cases, and both the number of conflict internal displaced people (IDPs) (r 0.389, P = 0.081), and number of returnees (r = 432, P = 0.050).

TI Processes of "securitization" of development cooperation and
   civil-military cooperation
SO POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT
AB With this contribution we intend to take a critical look at trends and processes in civil conflict transformation and crisis prevention in the context of security-related German development cooperation. Since the end of the Cold War the design of a new global security architecture has been debated. In the last decade, development cooperation of the countries of the global North was increasingly moved from an independent domain into a space of action, in which exterior, interior, defense, development, and environmental policies are united under the meta topic of "security". The present discourses on national and global security are characterized by tensions between a desired "civilizing" of conflict management and crisis prevention and an increasing discussion of opportunities, needs and practices of civil-military cooperation. Taking the example of the development cooperation with Afghanistan, the context and consequences of programmatic-institutional innovations of development policies in war zones are considered. Development cooperation in connection with the military privileges the reconfiguration of a military perspective, the specificity of civil conflict transformation is lost. Civil reconfigurations of security have to involve multiple uncertainties and security strategies of the local population. They cannot be adapted to a military security logic for example in the context of "counter-insurgency" characterized by a binary friend-or-foe scheme.

SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB The dynamic relationships between climate change and armed conflict have been discussed at length, but there have been few studies that integrate dimensions of climate adaptation into the processes linking climate change to armed conflict. By using geospatial grids for climate change and armed conflict, and country-level climate vulnerability measures of sensitivity and adaptive capacity, we empirically examine the effects of climatic and non-climatic conditions on the probability of armed conflict in Africa. Results suggest that there are close links between climate drivers and armed conflict. Importantly, greater levels of adaptive capacity lead to a lower likelihood of armed conflict. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that enhancing adaptive capacity under conditions of climate pressure will reduce the probability of people taking up arms in response to water scarcity.

SO COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES
AB This article examines the incomplete and sometimes contradictory evidence on the crime, organised crime and corruption situations in post-communist states, and then seeks to explain the apparent increase in all three in early post-communism. Among the factors considered are the impact of weak states and economics, neo-liberalism, globalisation, Schengen and Fortress Europe, the Communist legacy (the 'ghost from the past'), and collusion. The article then examines the dynamics of criminality and malfeasance in the region, and provides evidence to suggest that the crime and corruption situation has stabilised or even improved in most post-communist countries in recent times. The factors considered for explaining this apparent improvement are the role of external agents (notably the EU), the move from transition to consolidation, and the role of political will.

TI A Conditional Model of Local Income Shock and Civil Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB Common political economy models point to rationalist motives for engaging in conflict but say little about how income shocks translate into collective violence in some cases but not in others. Grievance models, in contrast, focus on structural origins of shared frustration but offer less insight into when the deprived decide to challenge the status quo. Addressing these lacunae, we develop a theoretical model of civil conflict that predicts income loss to trigger violent mobilization primarily when the shock can be linked to preexisting collective grievances. The conditional argument is supported by results of a comprehensive global statistical analysis of conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Consistent with theory, we find that this relationship is most powerful among recently downgraded groups, especially in the context of agricultural dependence and low local level of development, whereas political downgrading in the absence of adverse economic changes exerts less influence on ethnic conflict risk.

TI Does urban green space justly improve public health and well-being? A
   case study of Tianjin, a megacity in China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Urban green space (UGS) planning and design can not only influence economic development and the ecological environment but also have a significant impact on urban public health. Facing the increasingly serious public health crisis in megacities, promoting environmental justice in UGS, and improving the health and well-being of urban residents have become critical issues to be addressed in response to the global urban sustainable devel-opment goals (SDGs). Using data from a survey of 682 residents in the central district of Tianjin, we constructed a structural equation model based on theoretical analyses of spatial justice, social stratification, and Rawls' theory to reveal injustices in the accessibility of health benefits of UGS among residents of different socioeconomic status (SES) and explore the ways in which SES affects residents' health and well-being via UGS. The results indicate that: (1) Increasing the intensity of green space exposure can improve residents' health and well-being, but due to the urban green space premium effect, inequities exist among residents of different SES in enjoying the health benefits of UGS, thus deepening health inequality in megacities. (2) SES can influence residents' health and well-being through three paths: "green premium mechanism", "green exposure mechanism", and "green chain mechanism", and green space premium and green space exposure play a mediating role in the influence of SES on residents' health and well-being. (3) To promote environmental justice in UGS, provide urban human care, and guarantee public health equality, the UGS in China's megacities needs to be further explored in terms of UGS layout optimization, service quality improvement, and management system guarantee.

SO CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB In this article, we identify pathways that link the global financial crisis to health equity. We distinguish between direct and indirect channels of influence, and develop a conceptual model that builds on the literature analyzing the impacts of globalization on social determinants of health. The most pertinent direct pathways discussed are economic contraction, health budget cutbacks, rise in unemployment, and qualitative transformations of health systems. We also outline how other indirect channels of influence are likely to affect health equity, including cutbacks to welfare programs, labor market transformations, the emergence of an ideological climate conducive to austerity politics, and reductions in official development assistance. We conclude by suggesting that the current intensification of neoliberal policy implementation is likely to undermine health equity, and that a different path toward economic recovery is required to ensure equitable access to health care.

The conceptualisation of environmental problems as instances of interdependence and the acknowledgement of positive transaction costs are key insights into the nature of environmental problems. We also discuss how plurality of behavioural motivations and limited cognitive capacity have important implications for environmental decision making and its analysis. We show how evolutionary and collective action theories offer complementary takes on the choice and change of environmental governance institutions and how the concept of social capital can enrich analyses of environmental governance. We conclude that an emerging institutional ecological economics has the greatest relative advantage in analysing the design, implementation and effectiveness of environmental governance solutions.

AB What increases warring parties' ability to reach a negotiated settlement? In this study, I answer this question by examining the political environment a government and rebel group leadership internally encounter during a peace process. I disaggregate in-group dynamics of governments and rebels into their respective political elements that either grant autonomy or create constraints for resolution, namely, their constituencies and elites. I argue that willingness to end fighting does not always translate into the ability to make concessions. Although battlefield-related indicators may increase the likelihood of negotiations, it is internal cohesion that increases combatants' credibility as bargaining partners and improves the likelihood of settlement. To test these arguments, I introduce original data on negotiations for internal conflict-dyad-years between 1980 and 2005. Findings using two-stage censored probit models demonstrate that war-weariness increases willingness for negotiations whereas internal consensus creates opportunity for settlement.

TI Adaptive management and water security in a global context: definitions,
   concepts, and examples
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Conventional water governance that centralizes decision making and focuses on increasing supply has sometimes led to ecological degradation and inequitable outcomes. As a corrective, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) incorporates sustainability principles that integrate social, ecological, and infrastructural systems. However, this governance mode still does not address complex issues for an uncertain future, and fails to offer a clear goal. Adaptive management, another approach, relies on public participation and active knowledge exchange between scientists and policy-makers; it also incorporates uncertainty into decision-making. The concept of water security emerged subsequently to address the lack of a clear goal for water management. In this paper, we set into context the terms 'adaptive management' and 'water security' and review their evolution and their critiques. Both concepts require measurement and monitoring of outcomes in order to determine progress toward established goals so as to guide decision-making. We discuss the challenges and different ways of measuring water security and offer a representative list of potential indicators. The essay provides some examples of adaptive-management studies across the world and discusses adaptive management as it relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our concluding remarks reflect on present challenges, practical limitations, and promising ideas for a future type of water governance that is participatory, equitable, and adaptive.

TI Leanings and Dealings: Exploring Bias and Trade Leverage in Civil War
   Mediation by International Organizations
SO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Two characteristics of mediators - bias and leverage - are discussed intensively in the research on international mediation. However, whereas bias and leverage have been examined in mediation by states, relatively little is known about their role in mediation by international organizations (IOs). This study provides new ways of conceptualizing IO bias and leverage and utilizes unique data to measure the impact of IO bias and leverage on mediation outcomes. Exploring all cases of civil war mediation by IOs in the period 1975-2004, we find that IOs where member states provide support to both sides in a conflict outperform IOs whose member states remain disinterested. IOs with significant trade leverage also increase the likelihood of mediation success. The study demonstrates that IOs rarely have a neutral relationship to civil war combatants, that mediation by IOs is laden with member state interests, and that such interests shape outcomes.

TI Breaking the Cycle of Violence? Promises and Pitfalls of the Liberian

SO CIVIL WARS
AB This article analyses the prospects for sustainable peace in Liberia. The implementation of the 2003 peace agreement has largely been successful, but there are reasons for concern. Liberia's history of repeated cycles of violence and fragile peace provides valuable lessons for the current peace process. The article argues that Liberia's future is contingent on three critical aspects. First, the management of the immediate and long-term security challenges in terms of the reconstruction of the security forces, the reintegration of excombatants and the management of spoilers. Second, the capacity and willingness of the new government to promote democratic progress and good governance. Third, the political developments in the neighbouring region.

TI On Malaria and the Duration of Civil War
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Geographic factors such as rugged terrain and distance from capital cities are widely believed to prolong civil wars by enabling rebel groups to resist total defeat. This article argues that prevalence of malaria can similarly serve to asymmetrically enhance rebels' defensive capabilities and thus prolong civil war. Malaria prevalence does so in three complementary ways. First, while malaria can inflict costs on both government and rebel troops, these costs are magnified for larger and denser human groups; thereby ensuring that the costs of malaria will often be higher among government troop deployments. Second, because government soldiers are rotated in and out of conflict zones whereas insurgents typically are not, the former are likely to have a higher nonimmune exposure rate than the latter, which further ensures that government forces will be more susceptible to contracting and spreading malaria. Third, malaria can also indirectly prolong civil war by helping to maintain a socio-geographic environment that is conducive to insurgency. These three complementary factors advantage rebel forces' abilities to resist defeat by government forces and prolong civil conflicts. I empirically test these arguments by examining the duration of civil wars and find strong support for a prolonging effect of malaria on civil conflict.

TI The black box of power in polycentric environmental governance
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric environmental governance-the popular alternative-involves many centres of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal. Yet, longitudinal analysis reveals many polycentric systems are struggling to cope with the growing impacts, pace, and scope of social and environmental change. Analytic shortcomings are also beginning to appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance. We delineate an important and emerging research agenda for polycentric environmental governance, integrating diverse types of power into analytical and practical models.

TI Citizen participation for integrated assessment: new pathways in complex
   systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
AB Citizen or community participation is a guiding principle for environmental decision-making, but in practice it is often compromised and contradictory. Two themes in participation can be defined. One is in the 'product' or outcome of decision-making, and aims for more effective and appropriate evaluations and decisions. The other is participation in the 'process', where devolved decision-making itself can serve wider social and economic goals. Although both strands are crucial for the practice of 'integrated assessment' in environmental governance, a clearer view is needed of the scope and limits of such participation. This paper explores such scope and limits by applying a conceptual 'integrated assessment' framework. This is drawn from a major case study on sustainable development for a city-region in the north of the UK. Such a framework helps to identify the many roles of citizen participation from a complex systems perspective. Selected examples of current practice highlight the problems and opportunities for citizen participation in environmental governance.

TI Repression and refuge: Why only some politically excluded ethnic groups
   rebel
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB This article asks why ethnic exclusion from executive-level state power leads to armed conflict in some cases but not in others. To resolve this puzzle, it focuses on the possible role of five additional, qualitatively coded factors that have been considered by either grievance or opportunity theories of civil war but for which quantitative data are not readily available. To assess the combined relevance of these factors, the authors use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to explore the diverging conflict trajectories of 58 most similar' ethnic groups. These groups have a uniformly high conflict propensity because they are politically excluded, situated in poor countries, live geographically concentrated, and comprise substantial parts of the population; yet, only 25 of them actually experienced violent conflict. The results show that the resentment created by ethno-political exclusion translates into violent conflict if the state reacts against initial protests and mobilization with indiscriminate violence, and if there is a refuge area either within or outside the country that allows regime opponents to organize armed resistance. Moreover, a more processual analysis of conflict dynamics reveals that the conditions conducive to ethnic rebellion appear in a particular temporal sequence with a clear and universal escalation pattern.

AB This paper sets out to the appropriateness of values education as a component of all schooling. The development of our society has changed considerably priorities, needs and points of view. On the other hand, immigration has increased in few years and diversity is a common situation in schools. Differences and diversity often breed difficulties.
   The development of values education is as important as any other aspect in the scholar curriculum, although it seems not to be capable of having practical curriculum impact.
   We will consider the need, the exigency and urgency of peace, equity, solidarity and human rights values education in order to resolve conflicts and other issues and to learn how to accept differences. Values education should be included in all the scholar curricula as a priority. When all qualities attached to the concepts of learning to live together are considered, education to achieve peace, human rights, democracy and sustainable development is undoubtedly a holistic linked process. All values related to peace are linked to those of human rights, democracy and diversity.

TI Shifting discourses of nature in participatory processes for
   environmental management
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB The increasing use of participatory processes in environmental governance and management has implications for the way different conceptualisations of nature and the environment are recognised within environmental decision-making. This article draws on a case study of the Ongatoro Maketu estuary restoration initiative in Aotearoa, New Zealand, to examine how shifting discourses of nature and the environment intersect with the exercise of power to influence decision-making on the estuary. The study is based on a qualitative analysis of an archive of historical policy and planning documents, and 25 in-depth interviews with participants involved in the restoration initiative. The analysis demonstrates that despite a participatory process that often reinforced the dominant cultural paradigm and power relations, it created the space for different knowledge forms including western science and Maori knowledge to help improve the quality of decisions. We argue that well-designed participatory processes have much potential to address the growing complexity and uncertainty underpinning environmental governance and management.

TI Rebel Resource Efficiency and the Escalation of Civil Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB What explains the ebbs and flows of government-rebel battles during civil conflict? We posit that rebels, as actors dissatisfied with the status quo, challenge the government when they can sustain fighting and absorb losses on the battlefield. This is possible when the group's resource base is stable and unlikely to be undermined by market forces, government action, or external interveners. If, however, rebel portfolios are extraordinarily profitable, rebels will focus on profiting from their investments, making the escalation of armed conflict less likely. Using a measure that captures the efficiency of rebel resource portfolios and two illustrative cases, we find evidence for this curvilinear relationship: conflicts escalate as resource portfolio efficiency increases but de-escalate slightly when portfolios are very efficient. Thus, the decision to escalate a conflict is revealed to be a function of the entire bundle of resources controlled by rebels and the market value of those resources. By accounting for the entirety of rebel resource portfolios, this study refines the insurgent-resource nexus, leading to a better understanding of civil conflict dynamics.

TI How and when armed conflicts end: Introducing the UCDP Conflict
   Termination dataset
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB This article presents new data on the start and end dates and the means of termination for armed conflicts, 1946-2005. These data contribute to quantitative research on conflict resolution and recurrence in three important respects: the data cover both interstate and intrastate armed conflicts, the data cover low-intensity conflicts, and the data provide information on a broad range of termination outcomes. In order to disaggregate the UCDP-PRIO Armed Conflict dataset into multiple analytical units, this dataset introduces the concept of conflict episodes, defined as years of continuous use of armed force in a conflict. Using these data, general trends and patterns are presented, showing that conflicts do not exclusively end with decisive outcomes such as victory or peace agreement but more often under unclear circumstances where fighting simply ceases. This pattern is consistent across different types of conflict, as is the finding that victories are more common in conflicts with short duration. The article then examines some factors that have been found to predict civil war recurrence and explores whether using the new dataset produces similar results. This exercise offers a number of interesting new insights and finds that the determinants for civil war recurrence identified in previous research are sensitive to alternate formulations of conflict termination data. The findings suggest that intrastate conflicts are less likely to recur after government victories or after the deployment of peacekeepers. If the previous conflict is fought with rebels aiming for total control over government or if the belligerents mobilized along ethnic lines, the risk of recurrence increases. The discrepancy in findings with previous research indicates the need for further study of conflict resolution and recurrence, for which this dataset will be useful.

TI Strategic Territorial Power-Sharing and Multi-Party Bargaining in Civil
   Wars
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB Territorial power-sharing arrangements in civil wars face trade-offs between broadening inclusions and dangers of secession. This article argues that in civil wars over a government, the commitment problem is overcome as secession is not in its political agenda, however, the central concern pertains to the issues that arise in policymaking. Granting autonomy at the subnational level leads to peace without weakening the central authority. In addition, in bargaining over policies with multiple conflict parties, a government strategically makes concessions of territorial power-sharing to retain the status quo of national policy and positions in the government in a situation where dominance by one party is not attainable. It signals a government's less resolute attitude in accommodating additional rebel groups. Hence, territorial power-sharing entails positive externality. This article finds that in civil wars over a government, at a dyad level, the positive effects of territorial power-sharing in peace decreases over time. Instead, the likelihood of a peace agreement with another rebel group increases. The results imply that the effectiveness of the autonomy arrangement depends on strategic concessions and broader future inclusions.

SO GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB Capturing the scope and trajectory of changes in land use and land cover (LULC) is critical to urban and regional planning, natural resource sustainability and the overall information needs of policy makers. Studies on LULC change are generally conducted within peaceful environments and seldom incorporate areas that are politically volatile. Consequently, the role of civil conflict on LULC change remains elusive. Using a dense time stack of Landsat Thematic Mapper images and a hybrid classification approach, this study analysed LULC changes in Kono District between 1986-1991, 1991-2002 and 2002-2007 with the overarching goal of elucidating deviations from typical changes in LULC caused by Sierra Leone's civil war (1991-2002). Informed by social survey and secondary data, this study engaged the drivers that facilitated LULC changes during war and non-war periods in a series of spatial regression models in exploring the interface between civil conflict and LULC change.

The study finds that the poor and the less educated are most penalized by corruption. Frequency of bribes paid by family business owners is higher than that of others. In all cases, awareness of human rights reduces incidence of bribery. The article concludes that a human rights awareness and training campaign even when not directed against corruption can significantly reduce corruption.

SO JOURNAL OF PEACE EDUCATION
AB This article explores the African religious, cultural and philosophical dimensions of peace, conflict and conflict transformation. It seeks to examine African traditional religious and philosophical ideas as resources for the promotion of peace and justice and their implications for intra-state and inter-state conflict resolution activities. Specifically, it examines how the cultural dimensions of peace and conflict and its nonviolent resolution as expressed in the traditional religious and philosophical oral texts (the documented proverbs and symbols) of the Akan people of Ghana can contribute to our understanding and mechanisms for conflict transformation and peacebuilding strategies in Africa. It argues strongly for the promotion of some of the understudied positive elements in the religious and philosophical traditions of Africa for finding solutions or 'cures' for contemporary conflicts in Africa such as electoral disputes and internal ethnic conflicts, and their peaceful resolutions. Hence, it demonstrates how the African traditional methods for conflict resolution when effectively developed can substitute (or complement) in critical situations when the formal political institutions such as the Judiciary becomes ineffective. Finally, the study demonstrates how indigenous conflict transformation strategies can infuse some innovations, creativity and sustainability to the national and international attempts at resolving intractable African conflicts.

We approach the problem from the perspective of the concept of societal nature relations' (gesellschaftliche naturverhaltnisse), which can be situated in the framework of political ecology and, in this article, is combined with insights from regulation theory and critical state theory. The empirical analysis identifies fossilist patterns of production and consumption as the heart of the problem. These patterns are deeply rooted in everyday and institutional practices as well as societal orientations in the global North and imply a disproportionate claim on global resources, sinks and labour power. They thus form the basis of what we call the imperial mode of living' of the global North. With the rapid industrialisation of countries such as India and China, fossilist patterns of production and consumption are generalised. As a consequence, the ability of developed capitalism to fix its environmental contradictions through the externalisation of its socio-ecological costs is put into question. Geopolitical and economic tensions increase and result in a crisis of international environmental governance. Strategies like green economy' have to be understood as attempts to make the ecological contradictions of capitalism processable once again.

TI Environmental governance mechanisms in shipping firms and their
   environmental performance
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
AB A growing number of shipping firms seek to improve their environmental performance in the hope of developing environmentally sustainable shipping operations. Although environmental governance plays an essential role in leading shipping firms to improve their environmental performance, there is scant knowledge on the relationship between environmental governance and environmental performance in the shipping literature. We propose and empirically validate an integrated model to study how various environmental governance mechanisms (i.e., contractual, relational, and organizational) are enacted by shipping firms and their influence on shipping firms' environmental performance. Our study also examines the mediating roles of the relational and organizational mechanisms on shipping firms' environmental performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Achieving social-ecological fit in projectified environmental
   governance: Exploring vertical and horizontal dimensions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Social-ecological fit has been a popular approach to assessing the connectedness between social and ecological systems in environmental governance. However, the role of projects in social-ecological fit has yet to be explicitly problematized and conceptualized. Given the centrality of projects - i.e. temporally limited organizations that bring various actors into collaboration to pursue clearly defined goals and tasks - in environmental governance, this is a serious shortcoming in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by drawing on the hitherto unconnected literatures on projectified environmental governance and social-ecological fit. We then assess the extent to which fit can be achieved in projectified environmental governance. To do this, we develop a novel framework for assessing the vertical and horizontal dimensions of social, spatial, and temporal fit and conduct an empirical study of the European Union's LIFE Program and environmental projects funded by the program in Estonia. Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal fit of projects is contingent on social fit, i.e., the alignment of interests and needs of project-related actors. Frictions between various levels of decision-making also condition the possibilities of achieving fit horizontally across stakeholder groups and ecological systems as well as of sustaining project results over time.

SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
AB This research focuses on how Indigenous peoples might participate in collaborative environmental governance initiated by networked nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Fourteen Indigenous and six non-Indigenous board members and partners of Canadian Model Forests were interviewed and discussed seven aspects of collaborative governance affecting Indigenous participation: purpose and vision; decision-making structure(s); roles and responsibilities; engagement; capacity; leadership; and, cultural suitability. Participants described four possible participation structures: external advisory committee; internal board subcommittee; hybrid internal-external advisory board; and internal ad hoc group. Here, design options and implications of each model are considered, offering choices for engagement where NGOs seek to lead collaborative approaches.

TI Environmental governance of a Belt and Road project in
   Montenegro-National agency and external influences
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an ambitious effort to increase trans-continental connectivity and cooperation mainly through infrastructure investments and trade. On the one hand, this globally unparalleled initiative is expected to foster economic growth, but on the other hand, it can have substantial environmental implications. The BRI creates new challenges and opportunities for environmental governance as new actor constellations emerge in BRI host countries to plan and construct large infrastructure projects. Although China has outlined its vision of building a "green Belt and Road", it remains unknown how it unfolds on the ground.As an example of a BRI project with clear environmental implications, we present a case study of the BarBoljare highway in Montenegro. Based on expert interviews, we elucidate the complex web of actors and contractual arrangements involved, and demonstrate how internal and external actors exert influence on domestic environmental governance in this EU candidate country in the Western Balkans. We find that Montenegro has substantial agency over the environmental governance of this BRI project, but shows little concern over the environmental impacts of the project. Environmental issues could have been prevented during the spatial planning phase, but important governance instruments such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were of limited effectiveness due to its fast and late completion, lack of assessment of alternative routes, and the limited enforcement of the provisions therein. International institutions like the EU or UNESCO have drawn on their normative power in environmental governance to demand greater environmental safeguards from Montenegrin authorities. This case is illustrative of a larger set of BRI projects which run the risk of falling short on sustainability due to a lack of environmentally sound and transparent planning and implementation.

TI An ecological public health approach to understanding the relationships
   between sustainable urban environments, public health and social equity
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
AB The environmental determinants of public health and social equity present many challenges to a sustainable urbanism-climate change, water shortages and oil dependency to name a few. There are many pathways from urban environments to human health. Numerous links have been described but some underlying mechanisms behind these relationships are less understood. Combining theory and methods is a way of understanding and explaining how the underlying structures of urban environments relate to public health and social equity. This paper proposes a model for an ecological public health, which can be used to explore these relationships. Four principles of an ecological public health-conviviality, equity, sustainability and global responsibility-are used to derive theoretical concepts that can inform ecological public health thinking, which, among other things, provides a way of exploring the underlying mechanisms that link urban environments to public health and social equity. Theories of more-thanhuman agency inform ways of living together (conviviality) in urban areas. Political ecology links the equity concerns about environmental and social justice. Resilience thinking offers a better way of coming to grips with sustainability. Integrating ecological ethics into public health considers the global consequences of local urban living and thus attends to global responsibility. This way of looking at the relationships between urban environments, public health and social equity answers the call to craft an ecological public health for the twenty-first century by re-imagining public health in a way that acknowledges humans as part of the ecosystem, not separate from it, though not central to it.

SO INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW
AB Today's international society is concerned with anti-bribery exchanges rather than universal issues of anti-corruption in dealing with anti- corruption round under the guidance of advanced countries. This trend is related to national competitiveness, and it is useful for the effective anti-bribery exchanges rather than the solution of universal corruption problems. This study tests the correlation between democratization and transparency in Southern Europe, East Asia, and Latin America. It shows the validity of argument that democratization brings about anti- corruption. Today, developing countries are facing serious corruption problems which prevent politico-economic development and social consensus in the long run. Their success and failure of fighting against corruption will hinge on economic development and political democratization. Specially, transparent society based on politico-economic development will eliminate corruption problems in the future of Southern Europe, East Asia, and Latin America.

TI Catalyzing Corporate Commitment to Combating Corruption
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This article considers what policy reforms may help catalyze corporate commitment to combating corruption. The starting point for this discussion is a voluntary, corporate principles approach to self-regulation. Such an approach should seek to encourage corporations to implement effective compliance and ethics programs and to disclose information related to their anti-corruption activities to relevant stakeholders. Although a corporate principles approach is a private initiative, there is a significant role for the public sector. This article discusses some of the ways that the public sector can support and further the goals of a corporate principles approach to combating corruption. The reforms discussed in this article include amnesty programs for corporations that self-disclose corrupt payments, the use of corporate monitors in the enforcement of anti-corruption laws, expanding the definition of corruption in criminal laws, sustainability reporting indicators related to bribery, and the implementation of multi-stakeholder initiatives to support a corporate principles approach.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Effective global environmental governance is the only viable way to solve the human environmental crisis. For a long time, China has been an active promoter and contributor to the global environmental governance system. In recent years, China has enhanced the penalty intensity of environmental crimes, the environmental pollution crimes in particular, and received good results in order to better realize the construction of ecological civilization and better fulfill the emission reduction targets of international environmental treaties. The deterioration of China's environmental crisis in the past and the lack of deterrent effect of China's environmental laws are closely related to the ineffective punishment of environmental crimes. In order to better promote environmental protection careers, China's environmental crimes still need to be continuously optimized in terms of adding charges, legislative models and restorative justice.

TI Financing the green projects: Market efficiency and volatility
   persistence of green versus conventional bonds, and the comparative
   effects of health and financial crises
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB The establishment of the green bond market is an attempt to attain environmental sustainability from the finance perspective. One of the factors that could either hinder or promote this course is the degree of market efficiency of the market. Against this background, this study comparatively examines the market efficiency of the U.S. green and conventional bonds. In addition, the performance of both markets is investigated during global health and financial crises. Applying the fractional integration technique, we find that the overall green and conventional bonds markets are still inefficient, indicating that green and conventional investors can make excess gains by predicting the future trends of bond prices. There is also evidence that the green bond market exhibits higher volatility persistence during the global health crisis than during the global financial crisis. These findings are corroborated by the GARCH-based models, whose results show that volatility shocks are more persistent in the green bond market during the health crisis than during the financial crisis. However, the conventional bond market observes persistence in volatility shocks during both events. Towards sustainable environment goals, these results have relevant implications for green investors and policy makers.

SO IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES
AB This paper focuses on the principal parties' manifestos in UK statewide elections 19702010. It makes an original contribution by using a mixed methodology to examine the electoral discourse, issue-salience and policy framing associated with civil conflict resolution (CCR) proposals for Northern Ireland. Mandate and accountability theory suggest that party programmes may play an important role in understanding CCR. Accordingly, a series of hypotheses is tested and the findings used to advance an Electoral Discourse Model of Civil Conflict Resolution. The findings show that electoral politics matter in shaping CCR. Statistically significant inter-party differences in issue-salience and policy framing are revealed as parties seek to secure issue-ownership, influence voter preferences and secure a mandate for action. An iterative inter-party process is shown to lead to frame convergence over time, thereby providing an indicator of progress towards conflict resolution.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The double burden of material deprivation and the psychological consequences of violent conflict has long-lasting effects on children's wellbeing. Assessing child needs is therefore crucial to inform policies and move from humanitarian assistance towards reconstruction and development. We provide an analysis of the situation of children in east Mosul, Iraq, using unique data from a rapid humanitarian assessment administered on the ground immediately following the city's liberation from ISIL in 2017. We develop a counting measure of multidimensional deprivation using nine dimensions. This measure shows the similarities and dissimilarities in the incidence of each deprivation across children with different displacement statuses: Internally Displaced Person (IDP), IDP returnee, host, and stayee. IDP and returnee children are the two most deprived groups in multiple dimensions, and food security remains a pressing issue for IDP children in particular. We explore with econometric analysis the relationship between deprivation and vulnerability on the one hand and humanitarian aid on the other. While immediate assistance is correlated with fewer deprivations, many deprived children were still missed by assistance. Aid efforts during any humanitarian emergency should consider children's distinct deprivations in a deliberate and targeted manner rather than treating them simply as members of vulnerable households.

TI Water Integrity: From Concept to Practice
SO FRESHWATER GOVERNANCE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
SE Global Issues in Water Policy
AB The adherence of water stakeholders and institutions to integrity principles is critical to improve water governance and sustainable water development. Integrity is strongly manifested in water decision-making, and the level of integrity plays a critical role in deciding the outcomes of decision-making, that is, who gets what water, when and how. In many countries, fragmented institutions obstruct accountability in a sector with high investment and aid flows, making the water sector particularly vulnerable to corruption. Governance failures such as corruption can take place at multiple levels and traverse all water uses, incurring huge cost for societies, environment and human development. This chapter provides insights into the role of integrity to improve governance and suggests an apparent need to include integrity and anticorruption-related issues in the analysis of and policy responses to water crises. Accountability in water supply services is used as an example to outline challenges and opportunities for strengthening integrity.

TI Governing the green economy in the Arctic
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB In Sweden's Norrbotten County, a "green transition" driven by market demand and new normative structures is underway, creating a regional mega-project designed to put Sweden at the forefront of emerging green industries. These industries, such as carbon-neutral steel fabrication, battery production, and data center hosting, all require large amounts of energy, land, and minerals. This paper applies the regional environmental governance framework to Arctic data to examine which stakeholders have the capacity to impose their agenda on the Arctic environment and the points of conflict and collaboration during this period of accelerated growth. The paper tests the assumption that regional governance accommodates a plurality of interests. A case study examining Norrbotten County's industrial mega-project centered around Lulea, Sweden, identifies a dominant coalition uniting government and industry that supports norms seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this region. However, the existing regional governance model does a poor job of integrating the local Indigenous Sami preferences for land use. At the core of the difference between actors advancing the green economy and the local Sami reindeer herders are divergent conceptions of nature and sustainability.

AB The main achievements of the debates on deliberative democracy and democratised science are investigated in order to analyse the reasons, meanings and prospects for a democratisation of global environmental policy. A deliberative systems approach, which emphasises the need to explore how processes in societal spheres interact to shape the deliberative qualities of the system as a whole, is adopted. Although science plays a key role in this, its potential to enhance deliberative capacity has hardly been addressed in deliberative theories. The democratisation of science has potential to contribute to the democratisation of global environmental policy, in that it also shapes the potential of deliberative arrangements in the policy sphere. Deliberative arrangements within the policy sphere may stimulate the democratisation of science to different degrees.

TI Good Governance within Public Participation and National Audit for
   Reducing Corruption
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The globalization process and acceptance of a new paradigm for world development aimed at attaining sustainable development require extending the concept of good governance, which allows the improvement of institutional quality. At the same time, governance performance depends on corruption and public participation in national audits. The paper aimed to analyze the impact of public participation in national audits on corruption governance. The object of investigation was 30 Chinese provinces for 2008-2017. The study applied a regression model with the preventive, exposed, and defensive functions of audits. The findings showed that the "governance view" of the audit is the root cause of the audit. In addition, the "immune system" function of national audits has an inhibitory effect on corruption, among which the deterrent effect of the defense function is the most-influential. The influence of public participation in national audits on corruption governance is mainly reflected in the deterrence and resistance function of national audits. The paper contributes to audit theory by incorporating the public participation mechanism, improving the governance path of "national audit-public participation-corruption governance". It allows improving the national audit "immune system" function by considering the democratic connotation of decision-making and developing a good governance environment.

TI Equity, sustainability and governance in urban settings
SO GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION
AB In this commentary the urban setting is explored from the perspective of ecological sustainability and social equity. Urban-related issues are highlighted related to social inequality, deficits in urban infrastructures, behavior-related illnesses and risks, global ecological changes, and urban sprawl. Approaches to addressing these issues are described from the perspective of urban governance, urban planning and design, social determinants of health, health promotion, and personal and community empowerment. Examples of successful strategies are provided from Latin America, including using participatory instruments (assessments, evaluation, participatory budgeting, etc.), establishing intersectoral committees, increasing participation of civil society organizations, and developing virtual forums and networks to channel participatory and collaborative processes. A way forward is proposed, using the urban setting to show the imperative of creating intersectoral policies and programs that produce environments that are both healthy and sustainable. It will be important to include new forms of social participation and use social media to facilitate citizen decision-making and active participation of all sectors of society, especially excluded groups.

   THE SOURCES AND COSTS OF TERRORISM AND ORGANISED CRIME
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB This article maps notions of (in)security and security policy within the European Union (EU) since the 1990s using the cases of terrorism and organised crime. It traces interpretations of European policy-makers about the sources and costs that these two human-induced insecurities incur on Europe's societies and identifies the rationalities underlying the respective perceptions and policy actions. The analysis reveals that there are different logics at work that guide the economics of security: path dependency, reactive logics, emotions, integration dynamics and institutional interests, external pressures and more recently also considerations about the potential effects on the European economy. However, the EU's attempts to model cost scenarios still remain underdeveloped.

TI PUTTING THE ABC IN ESG: THE ROLE OF ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
   COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS IN ENHANCING ESG COMMITMENTS
SO ALBERTA LAW REVIEW
AB Investors and corporate stakeholders increasingly find insights into a corporation's performance and long-term sustainability through an organization's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) program. But, even with the increased focus on ESG programs, gaps still exist for important social and governance risks. Organizations can address these gaps by implementing an anti-bribery corruption (ABC) compliance program as part of their overall ESG program. This article focuses on an ABC compliance program's role within a broader corporate ESG framework, identifies key performance indicators that address corruption risks, and explains how to monitor and measure an ABC compliance program's success over time. In addition, the article provides a list of objective and verifiable metrics to measure the quality of disclosures made to the public.

TI Modelling Terrorism and Political Violence
SO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB This article introduces some conceptual thoughts to the study of terrorism and provides answers to questions such as: can terrorism be studied like other crime phenomena? What are the conceptual and methodological challenges when framing terrorism as crime or military conflict? What are the epistemological consequences of studying a highly politicized object? What makes terrorist violence different from other forms of political violence such as guerrilla warfare and insurgency? For this purpose, in the first part of the article a review will be conducted to ascertain what criminologists have contributed to the conception of terrorism. In the second part a model of terrorism is elaborated that depicts the crucial parameters of this form of political violence and thereby bypasses some of the existing conceptual difficulties and misconceptions. We learn from the various definitions of terrorism that the singularity of terrorism has something to do with the victim, the purpose and the consequences of violence. Specifically the fact that terrorists are as indifferent to the various targets as they are to the various political consequences of their attack is what distinguishes terrorism from related phenomena of political violence.

TI Forum Theatre as a mechanism to explore representation of local people's
   values in environmental governance: A case of study from Chiapas, Mexico
SO PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB Nature degradation, poverty and social discrimination are some of the consequences of unfair decision-making over environmental resources within rural communities in the Global South. Barriers to achieving fair environmental decisions are entrenched power differences and the lack of representation of the diversity of local values in environmental decision-making. Using intersectionality and value pluralism as a conceptual base, this is the first paper to examine the potential of Forum Theatre, a performance arts-based method, to discuss 'solutions' regarding power differences and values towards nature in environmental decision-making. We implemented Forum Theatre in two rural villages in Chiapas, Mexico, framed around conflicts and power differences in eco-tourism development. Participants felt empathy with the Forum Theatre characters and dissatisfaction over the conflicts, and this motivated them to engage and participate in collective reflections on their own personal experiences with power differences in environmental decision-making. From these reflections, participants performed diverse 'solutions' to the conflicts, bringing to the fore plural interconnected and dynamic values towards nature in these narratives. Despite this, Forum Theatre does not look to 'solve' conflicts; it is a safe space to explore how power differences and values towards nature play out in environmental decision-making. Results offer a promising picture of the potential of Forum Theatre as an opening where participants could discuss power differences and values towards nature. However, establishing its potential as a tool in environmental decision-making would require engaging those involved in implementing environmental decisions that affect the communities but who operate from other levels of the governance structure, such as policy-makers and large NGOs.

TI Managing natural resources in the Anthropocene. The case of the Seveso
   river basin in Milan
SO CLIMATE CRISIS IN MEDITERRANEAN EUROPE: CROSS-BORDER AND
   MULTIDISCIPLINARY ISSUES ON CLIMATE CHANGE
SE Geographies of the Anthropocene
AB In the last twenty years, local administrations, national and supranational governments have favored the use of governance tools in order to stimulate citizens' participation in the management of natural resources, through the enhancement and inclusion of civil society in decision-making processes. However, it is well documented that these projects also have negative results for the communities and that they are often conceived, implemented and evaluated by teams of experts and agencies external to local contexts. Some scholars argue that these forms of participatory governance actually represent mechanisms useful for managing today's socio-environmental insustainability. The main objective of these 'devices' would be the attempt to manage the undesirable effects of ecological alterations as long as possible, without changing the socio-ecological relationships that have produced the current un-sustainable scenarios (Bluehdorn, 2011; 2014). The objective of this contribution is to analyze the conflict / consensus dynamics that have occurred in the last 15 years in the management of the 'Seveso river contract' and related environmental issues, also in a broad perspective of territorial planning and natural resources management, in an era of global ecological crisis. The research is oriented along the theoretical lines of political ecology and post-ecology and it is part of the broad debate concerning the relationship between ecology and democracy.

TI Changing horses in midstream: Leadership changes and the civil war peace
   process
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB We examine the impact of governmental leadership changes on the civil war peace process. In line with the literature on leadership changes and interstate war, we argue that transitions can help overcome lags in the rational updating process, leading to negotiations and termination through negotiated settlements. However, while studies of interstate relations emphasize the role of "outsider" changes that produce new winning coalitions, we argue that owing to the critical nature of credible commitment problems within the civil war peace process, only "insider" changes can generate the benefits of leadership change while mitigating uncertainty generated by leadership turnover. Using existing and original data on changes in governmental leadership, we find support for our expectations. Leadership changes can produce conditions favorable to negotiations and settlements, but only changes from inside the existing regime should be encouraged to avoid prolonging the conflict.

TI Get off my lawn: Territorial civil wars and subsequent social
   intolerance in the public
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB It is argued that threat related to territorial civil wars generates negative interpersonal attitudes that are both more intense and more broadly oriented than previously thought. That is, civil wars fought over issues of autonomy or secession foment social intolerance, a broad orientation that extends well beyond members of former enemy groups to an aversion to interpersonal differences in general. The expectation that the issue the civil war is fought over is consequential is tested with data from the World Values Survey and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The empirical domain consists of over 130,000 individuals across 123 surveys in 69 countries over the 1989-2008 period. Results from multilevel models indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between domestic territorial conflicts and subsequent social intolerance. Substantively, territorial civil wars have a far greater impact on individuals' attitudes than do standard' correlates of social intolerance that are well established in the literature. Further, non-territorial civil war is unrelated to attitudes of social intolerance. Empirical results are robust to several model specifications and are not a mere artifact of the potential reverse relationship, whereby intolerant societies are (erroneously) presumed to be at a higher risk of civil wars in the first place. The findings have implications for the understanding of civil war resolution, civil war reoccurrence, and the contextual correlates of interpersonal intolerance.

TI Refugees and Syrian Civil War: analysis and perspectives on reception in
   Turkey
SO TEMPO E ARGUMENTO
AB This article examines a key issue of the Syrian Civil War: the war refugees in Turkey. In particular, the article also outlines scenarios for this refugees' reception based on the current status of the armed conflict. Methodologically, the research is grounded on the triangulation of data that combine specialized bibliography, documents from humanitarian organizations and UNHCR information on the subject, in the light of the literature evaluating international scenarios. Turkey has been one of the countries that has welcomed Syrians since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria in 2011. In this context, the research addresses this initiative and the challenges faced by the country due to the large number of refugees in its territory, also reflecting on the prospects for this reception. Thus, the article initially presents the definition of refugees and the contextualization of the Syrian conflict that caused the departure of many civilians. It then examines Turkey's humanitarian reception and the challenges that have arisen over years in which the conflict persists. Finally, it seeks to build three possible scenarios for the Syrian civil war and the reception of Syrian refugees.

TI The 'dirty downside' of global sporting events: focus on human
   trafficking for sexual exploitation
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives: Human trafficking is as complex human rights and public health issue. The issue of human trafficking for sexual exploitation at large global sporting events has proven to be elusive given the clandestine nature of the industry. This piece examines the issue from a public health perspective.
   Study Design: This is a literature review of the 'most comprehensive' studies published on the topic.
   Methods: A PubMed search was done using MeSH terms 'human traffickings' and 'sex trafficking' and 'human rights abuses'. Subheadings included 'statistics and numerical data', 'legislation and jurispudence', 'prevention and control', and 'therapy'. Only papers published in English were reviewed.
   Results: The search showed that very few well-designed empirical studies have been conducted on the topic and only one pertinent systematic review was identified. Findings show a high prevalence of physical violence among those trafficked compared to nontrafficked women. Sexually transmitted infections and HIV AIDS are prevalent and preventive care is virtually non-existent.
   Conclusion: Quantifying human trafficking for sexual exploitation at large global sporting events has proven to be elusive given the clandestine nature of the industry. This is not to say that human trafficking for sex as well as forced sexual exploitation does not occur. It almost certainly exists, but to what extent is the big question. It is a hidden problem on a global scale in plain view with tremendous public health implications. (C) 2014 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Terrorism and Civil War: A Spatial and Temporal Approach to a Conceptual
   Problem
SO PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS
AB What is the relationship between civil war and terrorism? Most current research on these topics either explicitly or implicitly separates the two, in spite of compelling reasons to consider them together. In this paper, we examine the extent to which terrorism and civil war overlap and then unpack various temporal and spatial patterns. To accomplish this, we use newly geo-referenced terror event data to offer a global overview of where and when terrorist events happen and whether they occur inside or outside of civil war zones. Furthermore, we conduct an exploratory analysis of six separate cases that have elements of comparability but also occur in unique contexts, which illustrate some of the patterns in terrorism and civil war. The data show a high degree of overlap between terrorism and ongoing civil war and, further, indicate that a substantial amount of terrorism occurs prior to civil wars in Latin America, but yet follows civil war in other regions of the world. While the study of terrorism and of civil war mostly occurs in separate scholarly communities, we argue for more work that incorporates insights from each research program and we offer a possibility for future research by considering how geo-referenced terror and civil war data may be utilized together. More generally, we expect these results to apply to a wide variety of attitudes and behaviors in contentious politics.

TI Environmental Organised Crime: The Dirty Business of Hazardous Waste
   Disposal and Limited State Capacity in Africa
SO POLITIKON
AB Illegal transnational hazardous waste disposal was in the past not defined as a serious environmental crime as the crime is mostly victimless. Although there is a large global legal hazardous waste disposal industry, there is also an illicit one, involving illegal companies, disposal methods, terrorist and organised criminal groups. This article examines illicit hazardous waste disposal (e-waste) on the African continent, against the backdrop of Green Theory and Green Criminology. There are numerous e-waste sites and this article discusses a few in West Africa. Although tons of e-waste makes its way illegally into Africa from the developed North, large volumes are produced domestically. These sites provide a source of income for thousands of people, but the local environment (plus human health) is damaged. Due to limited state capacity there are few examples of Green States on the continent. The state needs to step in as the regulator and facilitator of e-governance. The issue of e-waste in Africa is complex and warrants much more research from a Political Science perspective and requires more academic exposure in the Social Sciences in order to be placed on the domestic research and policy agenda.

TI Promoting human rights under fire: INGOs' mitigating effect on human
   rights violations during armed conflict
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB Can international nongovernmental organizations (INGO) mitigate human rights violations when armed conflict ensues? There is a reason to believe that the harsh conditions of war, which destabilize society and incite nationalist and militarist notions, would prevent the work of INGO from being effective. However, world polity scholarship suggests that regardless of these conditions INGOs can improve human rights standards. INGOs are one of the principal and most effective vehicles for the diffusion of international human rights norms. In this paper, we highlight the part INGOs play in monitoring human rights violations and its potential effect on states' human rights violations during war. Examining a global sample of countries that experienced war on their soil between 1977 and 2003, this paper studies the association between INGOs count per country per year with four human rights indexes. Results show an association between the presence of INGOs and improvement of human rights conditions.

TI Civil War and Life Chances A Multinational Study
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY
AB Civil war adversely affects life chances (i.e. economic well-being, food production and education) that are key to social and economic development; civil war and these life chances all, potentially, affect the most basic life chance - mortality. Results show that civil war worsens child mortality despite controls for other life chances. In contrast, civil war accounts for much of the impact of other life chances on child mortality. Information comes from 175 countries from 1985 through 1998. Given the broad and persistent impact of civil war, future research concerned with social and economic development and, ultimately, the life chances of the masses should consider civil war as a factor in their theories and analyses.

TI Fighting and Voting: Violent Conflict and Electoral Politics
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Two recent research programs-one on the sources of democratic consolidation and another on the causes and consequences of violent conflict-have tended to evolve in relative isolation. The contributions to this special issue of Journal of Conflict Resolution help to bridge this gap, through explicit theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between fighting and voting. Armed conflict and electoral politics may be strategic substitutes, in that political actors may optimally choose to submit to the ballot box or instead attempt to impose their will by force; or they may be strategic complements, in that actors use violence to bolster their electoral aims, or use electoral returns as sources of information on underlying preferences that they exploit in armed campaigns. In either case, the distribution of popular support for contending parties can shape not only the incidence but also the type of armed conflict, and it can also influence the incentives of parties to invest in institutional mechanisms that mitigate commitment problems and help to bring violent conflicts to an end. The contributions to this issue illuminate these themes and demonstrate the value of bringing these separate research programs into closer dialogue.

TI Thoughts on the Conflict Management Field after 30 Years
SO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This article surveys the emergence of conflict management from the academic and policy shadows into a far more prominent field of inquiry and practice. As the barriers to entry into third party roles collapsed at the end of the Cold War, the field of conflict management expanded, diversified, and fragmented into a range of practice areas (scholarly, policy-oriented, and operational). Four phases of this evolution are identified. An increasingly crowded field lacks gatekeepers or natural coherence, underscoring the need for leadership and sustained, coordinated efforts. The study of mediation has blossomed around the work of Zartman and others, while the policy community has swung back and forth in its enthusiasm for third party roles in an age where hard power and smart power vie for pride of place. Conflict management responses are increasingly spontaneous, ad hoc and case-specific. Debate is emerging over the pros and cons of engaging with armed non-state actors that are placed on proscribed lists in the struggle against terrorism. Post-conflict challenges continue to pose a severe test to practitioners of peacebuilding.

TI Organized crime, corruption and power
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The perception of organised crime as an external threat to political stability and integrity, as well as to orthodox commercial activity, is based on an assumption about the motives and intentions of organised criminals. It invariably results in a call for a 'war against crime'. The reality and the possible solutions are less dramatic but also more complex. Organised criminals are concerned with both legal and illegal businesses where bribery of public officials and involvement with orthodox commercial activity are part of that business. While organised criminals may want to enjoy the profits of their business rather than subvert societies what they do and how they do it can have adverse consequences for societies and should be addressed. In seeking to do this, however, it is necessary not only to analyse threats to target resources more effectively but also discourage those public figures and orthodox businesses whose enthusiasm for short-term benefit overrides their moral judgement and thus allows organised crime to be tolerated within the societies to which they are supposed to be an external threat.

TI Exploring the direct and indirect impacts of climate variability on
   armed conflict in South Asia
SO ISCIENCE
AB Although numerous studies have examined the effects of climate variability on armed conflict, the complexity of these linkages requires deeper understanding to assess the causes and effects. Here, we assembled an extensive database of armed conflict, climate, and non-climate data for South Asia. We used structural equation modeling to quantify both the direct and indirect impacts of climate variability on armed conflict. We found that precipitation impacts armed conflict via direct and indirect effects which are contradictory in sign. Temperature affects armed conflict only through a direct path, while indirect effects were insignificant. Yet, an in-depth analysis of indirect effects showed that the net impact is weak due to two strong contradictory effects offsetting each other. Our findings illustrate the complex link between climate variability and armed conflict, highlighting the importance of a detailed analysis of South Asia's underlying mechanisms at the regional scale.

TI Enemies within: Interactions between Terrorists and Democracies
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB I examine how the chief executive's political party affects domestic terrorism within democracies. In particular, I contribute to the literature on terrorism within democracies by arguing that domestic terrorist groups prefer attacking when right-wing parties hold office. I find evidence for this claim as well as results indicating that left-wing executives are more likely to cut deals with domestic terrorist groups. These trends suggest that domestic terrorist groups attack during right-wing governance to build their reputation and reduce violence during left-wing governance to appear moderate and get a deal. These results contribute to literatures on differences between left and right parties, how political institutions affect terrorism, and differences between domestic and transnational terrorism.

TI Power parity and peace? The role of relative power in civil war
   settlement
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Theories of civil war highlight how relative power affects conflict onset, dynamics, strategy, outcome, and duration. Yet most studies of civil war have not been able to capture rebel power adequately and often rely on national-level characteristics to infer relative power distributions. This study addresses this shortcoming by using a troop strength measure to test arguments about how relative power affects the likelihood of civil conflict settlement. Drawing on the international crisis bargaining literature, while noting the inherent differences between interstate and intrastate conflicts, this study argues that the condition of power parity increases the likelihood of negotiated settlement and ceasefire. Weak rebels are unable to achieve concessions through negotiation since governments view them as minor threats. Yet governments have difficulty defeating weak rebels due to an emphasis on guerrilla warfare. On the other end of the spectrum, rebels that are superior to the government in strength are unlikely to settle given their power advantage. Strong rebels that can rival the strength of the government (i.e. they are near parity) can exact more concessions because fighting at parity exposes information about how long each side can hold out while escalating the costs of war, giving each side a greater incentive to negotiate and eventually seek a ceasefire or peace agreement. This argument is supported using data on 112 dyads in the post-Cold War period.

TI Organised Criminal Groups and Conflict: The Nature and Consequences of
   Interdependence
SO CIVIL WARS
AB The relationship between criminality and conflict subverts traditional assumptions about organised crime. Consequently, analysis of the 'criminal' must be anchored to specific conflict contexts rather than to a universal typology of organised criminal groups. Organised crime and conflict are interdependent. In several conflict states, organised crime has exacerbated the level of violence and contributed to conflict's intractability. Conflict, meanwhile, creates unique opportunities for criminality to flourish and amplifies the threat that criminal groups pose to security, development and governance. Unless the peculiar supply and demand dynamics of conflict are addressed by the peace process, law enforcement initiatives alone will fail.

TI From political to personal violence: Links between conflict and
   non-partner physical violence in post-conflict Liberia
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB War and interpersonal violence together account for a large burden on global health. Yet very few studies look at the relationship between these types of aggression. Non-partner physical violence (NPPV) is an often-understudied form of gender-based violence (GBV). This analysis draws on two datasets from one conflict-affected country, Liberia, to evaluate the impact of conflict on NPPV post-conflict. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED) measures the intensity of the conflict in Liberia from 1999-2003, while the Demographic and Heath Survey (DHS) data measure women's experiences with violence four years post-conflict. Almost half of women surveyed (45%) indicated that they experienced any kind of NPPV, highlighting the widespread nature of this issue. A multilevel modelling approach was used to account for the nesting of individuals within districts. Women living in districts that experienced conflict events in four or five years were almost three times as likely (aOR 2.93, p < .001) to experience past-year NPPV compared to individuals living in no conflict districts. Findings from this study suggest women residing in a conflict event-affected district may be at heightened risk of increased violence even years after peace is declared.

TI Sexual violence and biased military interventions in civil conflict(1)
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB What is the impact of foreign troop support on combatant-perpetrated sexual violence against civilians? We hypothesize that biased troop support increases the risk of sexual violence by the subordinate party both as a consequence of strategic considerations and as a product of a situation increasingly conducive to opportunistic behavior. Time-series cross-section analyses of all civil wars during 1989-2012 are largely supportive of our expectation. Rebel groups are more likely to perpetrate sexual violence the more troop support the state receives. Likewise, state forces are more prone to commit sexual violence the more they are challenged by troops supporting the rebel group(s).

TI Clean, low-carbon but corrupt? Examining corruption risks and solutions
   for the renewable energy sector in Mexico, Malaysia, Kenya and South
   Africa
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB A decarbonized global energy sector is expected to need cumulative investments in the tens to hundreds of trillions of dollars between now and 2050. Due to its size, the current climate-business environment is therefore prone to corruption risks. Yet such corruption risks are rarely explored within the research community. Much of the extant literature on energy and corruption focuses on fossil fuels, especially oil, coal, and natural gas. However, evidence is emerging that corruption risks also feature in renewable energy markets. This paper asks: Who are the new private actors in selected renewable electricity markets in a sample of countries? How can they be profiled or categorized? To what extent do such actors face corruption risks? How do these actors manage or fail to manage corruption risks? More broadly, which successful collaboration mechanisms can be identified from the literature about how to reduce corruption? To provide an answer, in this paper the literature on renewable energy and corruption are extensively reviewed, with a focus on three particular sectors: hydroelectric dams, solar photovoltaic panels (in both grid-connected and off-grid configurations), and wind energy (including a mix of offshore and onshore designs). The paper then identifies eight distinct corruption risks evident across categories including nepotism, tender rigging, bribery, and tax evasion. The paper then explores particular corruption risks in four national contexts (Mexico, Malaysia, Kenya, and South Africa) before offering a suite of five recommendations and solutions to help address corruption. These solutions include corruption risk mapping, subsidy registers and sunset clauses, transparency initiatives, anti-corruption laws, and shared-ownership models.

AB The international community failed to convince the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to end their armed conflict peacefully. The agenda has now shifted towards investigating international crimes committed in the last phase of the civil war instead. The former and current governments of Sri Lanka have responded ambivalently to the calls of the international community for prosecution of perpetrators before hybrid or national courts and they have skilfully tapped into the grievances of various international, regional and domestic constituencies. Post- conflict justice has different meanings when viewed against a background of counterinsurgency discourse, reconciliation, institutional reform and economic development. As a result, the conflicting priorities between the often self-serving agendas of the different actors have rendered the prospects for prosecution of international crimes in Sri Lanka remote.

TI Mediating between tigers and lions: Norwegian peace diplomacy in Sri
   Lanka's civil war
SO CONTEMPORARY SOUTH ASIA
AB Sri Lanka has suffered from one of Asia's most intractable civil wars, and is remarkably resistant to resolution. The peace process was initiated with a ceasefire between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan Government in 2002. This article explores the implications of the Norwegian mediation on this process. We argue that Norway's aspiration to promote an image of being a global peacemaker and the consent from regional and global powers are important in explaining why Norway became involved. Moreover, the Norwegian mediation approach - based on impartiality, ownership by the two main parties, and internationalization - has had consequences for how the process has unfolded. For instance, it influenced the potential leverage of Norway and conceptions about bias. This article contributes to an understanding of how regional and global processes, as well as mediator characteristics and approaches, influence the dynamics of civil war termination.

SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Corruption is a proxy of low detection of opportunistic behavior and may influence managers' decisions. Considering an international scenario, the study investigates whether income shifting between subsidiaries and parents is emphasized for subsidiaries in less corrupted countries. Data refer to groups with the parent company in France, German, Italy, Spain, or UK. Using financial data, tax rate, and country corruption level, linear regression is carried out to determine the impact of corruption on income shifting process. Using anomie theory, this study offers additional evidence that corruption is a symptom of instability and influences managers' decision-making processes. Managers tend to shift income towards less corrupted countries and so, high bribery reduces the incentive to attract foreign income. These results are novel given we focus on European international groups and not merely on single firms. They confirm the positive effects of responsible business and the attractiveness of countries that control for corruption.

TI Democracy and self-rated health across 67 countries: A multilevel
   analysis
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Existing research has found a positive association between countries' level of democratic governance and the health of their populations, although that research is limited by the use of data from small numbers of high-income countries or aggregate data that do not assess individual-level health outcomes. We extend prior research by using multilevel World Health Survey (2002-2004) data on 313,554 individuals in 67 countries, and find that the positive association between democratic governance and self-rated health persists after adjusting for both individual- and country-level confounders. However, the mechanisms linking democracy and self-rated health remain unclear. Individual-level measures of socioeconomic status, and country-level measures of economic inequality and investments in public health and education, do not significantly mediate the association between democratic governance and self-rated health. The persistent association between democratic governance and health suggests that the political organization of societies may be an important upstream determinant of population health.

In this article we examine whether the transformation of rebel groups into political parties actually leads to the development of a durable peace after a civil war. Examining the likelihood of recurrence of civil wars in a country and recurrence of conflict in government-rebel group dyads after a settlement, we find that the inclusion and participation of former rebel parties in national government has an important impact on the likelihood of a durable post-settlement peace. Most importantly, not excluding major rebel parties from access to governing institutions is the most important factor in promoting post-conflict peace.

AB The local government units are political entities authorized by law to implement the waste management program of the government. The law is explicit on the mobilization of its power to reduce the generation of waste in the country. However, the local government sector cannot fully address the environmental problems due to financial limitations, lack of awareness, corruption, lack of political will and environmental governance programs. This research aims to develop environmental governance program to be adopted by local government units to achieve economic sustainability. The purpose of this study is to determine the compliance on the management strategies implemented by the local government units on environmental sustainability, the local governance policies approved for the implementation of waste resource conservation and waste reduction, the sustainability programs implemented by local government units to improve the environmental governance on education; environmental governance on values; environmental governance on health; and environmental governance on economic sufficiency; and to identify the initiatives designed by the local government units to decentralize the leadership on waste sustainability among local government branches. Secondary data was used to determine the compliance of policies implemented by the local government units. The survey method was employed to gather information from municipalities and cities on environmental governance programs implemented by the local government units. The findings revealed that the local government units designed their own monitoring & evaluation policy on waste disposal and they provided incentives and awards to schools for diligently monitoring waste disposal. The data on the level of implementation of local governance policies for waste resource conservation revealed that Local Government Units fairly implemented (3.03) this program. The level of implementation for local governance policies on waste reduction was fairly implemented (3.01) by the local government units. The local government units had their highest rating (3.23) on providing budget for information campaign. Also, they facilitated trainings to enhance community participation and involvement. The Local Government Units raised the public consciousness on the effects of wastes to the moral life of the community. Local government units practiced sustainability activities through the manufacturing of products from wastes (3.29). The Local Government Units practiced governance to its partner organization by implementing the reduction of waste policy. The Local Government Units' Environmental Governance Program on Education is focused on providing budget for information campaign (3.23). The Environmental Governance Program on Values was made greatly on lifestyle educational program (3.11). It is the priority of the Local Government Units to conduct ocular inspection through their medical personnel (3.35) as their way of practicing environmental governance on health. The production of goods from wastes (3.29) is the program of the environmental governance for the economic sufficiency of the municipality. The Local Government Units focused on the four areas of governance as they see it as the most important areas to keep the municipality self-sufficient, managed, and free from waste issues. The Local Government Units implemented local policies and alternative programs to improve the management of waste.
   The development programs of the Local Government Units are linkages and resolution of conflicts to improve the disposal of waste through participatory involvement of the people and partner entities.

TI Delineating participation in conservation governance: Insights from the

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB The active participation of local stakeholders in governing protected areas is increasingly recognized in biodi-versity conservation. While progress has been made in countries to facilitate inclusivity in conservation decision making, there is limited practical guidance of participatory mechanisms enabling stakeholder engagement. Disentangling formal and informal governance arrangements within protected areas illuminates how stakeholder participation in decision-making is shaped and potentially improved. Here, we provide an analytical framework characterising governance arrangements to examine the formal and informal mechanisms guiding stakeholder participation conservation decision-making in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (Spain). We conducted 76 semi-structured interviews and field observations with local stakeholders, and reviewed Park policy documents. Our findings reveal governance arrangements are contingent upon stakeholders' responsibility (shared vs. concentrated) and influence (equal vs. unequal), regardless of the (in)formality of decision making. We found four types of arrangements that characterise governance of Sierra de Guadarrama National Park-cooperative, consultative, informative, and prescriptive-and identified the mutually supportive role formal and informal mechanisms play in shaping participation. We argue stakeholders' responsibility and influence are key analytical axes to delineate participatory mechanisms in order to identify challenges and opportunities for more inclusive conservation. Our study provides analytical guidance that could be adapted and scaled up to other protected areas for understanding participation in conservation decision-making.

TI Environmental justice and ecological civilization in the Pearl River
   Delta, China
SO EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS
AB The central government of China aims to transform the Pearl River Delta (PRD) from a polluting and low value-added global factory to a sustainable region. The transformative vision of the PRD is underpinned by the ecological civilization concept. While ecological civilization represents a significant initiative in moving toward sustainable development, China's top-down and command-and-control mode of environmental governance may fall short of addressing multi-dimensional and multi-scalar social and environmental justice issues of the PRD cities. The authors therefore suggest embracing the concept of environmental justice to enhance ecological civilization, with the aim of benefiting every stratum of society. The concept of environmental justice is multi-faceted, embracing recognition, procedural, distribution and compensatory justice at different geographical scales, often calling for institutional changes. Without environmental justice, a harmonious and sustainable PRD would not be possible. In recent years, China has made unprecedented institutional adjustments to deal with environmental issues, such as conducting annual "health screening" and five-yearly thorough evaluations to monitor conservation and development. To embrace environmental justice, legislative changes are required to recognize individual environmental rights through collective action and public participation, incorporating citizens' inputs to the appraisal of cadres, and establishing intergovernmental institutionalized organizations.

Peng Wang focuses on the three dimensions of Chinese organised crime: the resurgence of the criminal underworld and rampant police corruption in mainland China; cross-border crime in Greater China; and Chinese organised crime overseas, including in the UK. The national, regional and international threats posed by ethnic-Chinese criminal groups require the law-enforcement agencies of both China and those countries hosting Chinese communities to improve their response strategies as a matter of urgency.

TI Municipal environmental governance in the Peruvian Amazon A case study
   in local matters of (in)significance
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to illustrate the particularities and challenges associated with creating municipal environmental governance institutions in the Peruvian Amazon.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case-study approach based on qualitative research, document analysis and interviews is used based on field research between 2007 and 2009.
   Findings - Findings reveal the limitations of municipal governance institutions to reflect local environmental concerns illustrated by the example of oil exploration. Whereas municipal institutions put in place resulted in environmental plans and policies, they failed to effectively address major sustainability concerns within their territorial boundaries. On the one hand, policy ambiguities about the meaning of "local" action reflect longstanding divides between centralised policy making and local agenda setting. On the other hand, findings point to the flexibility of local environmental processes easily neglecting core environmental problems.
   Practical implications - The conclusions justify reinforcing policy efforts to strengthen the mandate and competencies of municipalities on broader environmental matters. They also reinforce the need for more locally responsive and socially inclusive environmental agenda setting.
   Originality/value - The study sheds light on poorly described environmental governance aspects from an area of global significance. Amazonian affairs are emblematic for environmental conflicts related to deforestation, extractive industries and ecological complexity. Analyzing the importance of municipal processes is critical in this respect.

TI The impacts of warfare and armed conflict on land systems
SO JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
AB Land-use decisions can change abruptly in response to shocks, and warfare and armed conflicts are among the most drastic and globally frequent shocks. Yet, our understanding of where armed conflict affects land systems, how land-use patterns are impacted, and how far-reaching and persistent these changes are, is partial. We used a spatially detailed dataset on armed conflict and a literature review to explore these questions. A number of key insights emerged from our study: (1) warfare and armed conflict affect land systems mainly in more densely populated areas, regardless of the dominating land use; (2) warfare and armed conflict can impact land systems in major ways, but these effects are diverse and not unidirectional; (3) warfare and armed conflict primarily affects land systems locally, but can forge telecouplings; and (4) although the impact of warfare and armed conflict is often immediate, it can instigate long-lasting land-use legacies.

TI Outsourcing governance in Peru's integrated water resources management
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Participatory water governance has become highly influential around the world as a means for managing water resources. Scholars and practitioners advocate for the inclusion of previously marginalized communities in water resources management through the devolution of power, responsibility, and participation. Where community institutions are weak or missing, experts recommend strengthening or re-building them to enable inclusive decision-making over water resources. Our study looks at devolution in a government-initiated integrated water resources management approach in the Caylloma Province, located in the department of Arequipa, Peru. We used process tracing to analyze 97 qualitative interview transcripts with crop farmers and pastoralists managing water for irrigation, interview transcripts with personnel in water management agencies, and field notes from participant observation in water-related meetings. We found that farmers had limited ability to participate in local institutions for water management due to market integration and labor migration, among other socioeconomic and political stressors. For this reason, transferring more water management responsibilities and decision-making power to community-level institutions without considering the factors that limit their sustainability over time is not necessarily feasible or even desirable by local communities. Instead, strengthening and streamlining intermediary and government institutions at regional scales may be more effective at addressing local needs in watershed management.

TI Floods and armed conflict
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB We estimate the impact of large, catastrophic floods on internal armed conflict using global data on large floods between 1985 and 2009. The results suggest that while large floods did not ignite new conflict, they fueled existing armed conflicts. Floods and armed conflict are endogenously determined, and we show that empirically addressing this endogeneity is important. The estimated effects of floods on conflict prevalence are substantially larger in specifications that control for the endogeneity of floods, suggesting that treating natural disasters as exogenous phenomena may underestimate their impacts on sociopolitical outcomes.

TI The Dynamics of Conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh in
   the Post Peace Accord Period
SO SOCIAL ALTERNATIVES
AB The Chittagong Hill Tracts, located in the south-eastern part of Bangladesh, are regarded as the home of the indigenous people, resided in by 11 different indigenous ethnic groups, who are ethnically and culturally different from the mainstream Bengali people. However, the area has been subject to violent ethnic conflict since the late 1970s between the security forces of Bangladesh Government and the indigenous ethnic groups. A peace treaty titled the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was signed in 1997 between the government of Bangladesh and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) to end the armed conflict. However, the search for peace remains elusive as the region is still engulfed by violence in different ways including direct, structural and cultural violence. This has happened because the Accord has failed to pay due attention to transforming the conflict through reconciliation, community integration, and ensuring environmental sustainability, which could pave the ground to create peace from the bottom up. It is against this backdrop that the study focuses on the dynamics of conflict in the post-accord scenario in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

TI Contact and Conflict Resolution: Examining the Extent to which
   Interpersonal Contact and Cooperation Can Affect the Management of
   International Conflicts
SO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Conflict between states, as well as between governments and non-state actors, continues to pose one of the most serious threats to individuals in the international community today. In an effort to reduce the destruction caused by these conflicts, a number of interventions, processes, and conflict management methods have been attempted. One of these methods involves facilitating conditions for positive contact between the disputants thus enabling them to develop a rapport of some sort. While this idea has received widespread theoretical support, there is little empirical analysis considering the benefits of such an approach. Here we examine how the context in which contact occurs can affect conflict management; we outline the assumptions that underpin conditions of the context, and discuss strategies, such as interactive problem solving, that have at their heart the goal of improving conditions of contact and communication as a prelude to conflict resolution. Our research goes beyond most studies, in that we subject the ideas of various conditions of contact and communication to an empirical test. We develop specific hypotheses on the role and relevance of the conditions of contact, and investigate the extent to which conflict management techniques can create positive conditions to contribute to conflict resolution. An original dataset including various conflict management techniques is examined to analyze our hypotheses. Findings indicate that factors such as the rank of a mediator and the type of conflict are more significant predictors of successful conflict management than the involvement of a third party facilitator. We examine both interstate conflicts and civil conflict to determine whether these different types should be managed differently.

SO ASIAN ETHNICITY
AB This article - by looking at selected cases of the ethnic Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Mongols in the People's Republic of China (PRC), officially a unitary multinational state - proves that domestic ethnic conflicts have the potential to internationalize and become significant interstate crises. While internationalization factors may at times be difficult to differentiate, I highlight four main mechanisms: 1) third-party intervention, 2) irredentism/separatism, 3) refugee movements across borders, and 4) international ethno-terrorism. Media coverage of ethnic conflict may also initiate a call for justice from the international community. The PRC remains a special case, with the Chinese Communist Party's continued control over ethnic policy and interactions. This research article also reinforces the idea that ethnic conflict can be integrated into both comparative politics and international relations, as such domestic conflicts often involve and affect actors that transcend state boundaries.

AB Scholars who have sought to identify the triggers of rare political events have met with limited success. With respect to civil war, studies teach us to expect conflict where it is feasible. However, although we understand where civil conflict occurs, we do not quite understand when it occurs. Focusing on civil conflict, I argue that time-variant and time-invariant explanations relate to the outcome by means of two distinct causal processes, which has implications for the identification of triggers of rare events. I provide an easily implementable approach to improve rare event estimation that uses matching to leverage constant attributes to estimate the effects of rare predictors. I demonstrate the utility of this procedure by providing an aggregate and disaggregate example of civil conflict onset estimation.

AB Increasingly asymmetric affairs and a sense of injustice as well as accumulated unresolved narratives in the international order have facilitated the emergence of a coincidence of armed conflicts in recent years. A proliferative military framework has assisted additional radicalisation, violence and crises. Therefore, there is an imperative need for an alternative, legitimising approach, which enables nonviolent progress and long-term stability. Civic groups emerged as specialised actors and the empowerment of citizens through their inclusion in the decision-making process is sine qua non for building trust and enabling stabilisation and the advancement of peace. This paper analyses the contribution of civil society to sustainable conflict resolution and peace processes in Pakistan from a comparative perspective. It draws on the theoretical assumption that by providing spaces of interaction and constructive dialogue, civic initiatives may influence conflict transformation and transition processes towards sustainable peace. Actors of the civil society can contribute to different extents to various phases of conflict resolution, depending on their interests and organisational capacity. The paper compares the activities of CSOs working on track II and track III conflict resolution processes. The data were collected by the author during a field research in Pakistan in May-June 2015.

TI Politics of Pursuing Justice in the Aftermath of Civil Conflict
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Why do some states pursue transitional justice (TJ) in the immediate aftermath of armed conflict while others do not? What drives a state to select a particular type of justice mechanism over another? Building on the political explanations of TJ, we argue that postconflict justice (PCJ) decisions are driven by the interests and power of political elites shaped by recently ended conflicts. Our empirical analysis shows that conflict outcomes and their subsequent impact on the balance of power between the government and rebel groups are the most important determinants of PCJ decisions. Domestic trials are most likely to emerge out of a decisive, one-sided victory while truth commissions and reparations are most likely to occur after a negotiated settlement. We also find that conflict severity interacts with conflict outcomes to affect PCJ decisions.

TI Decolonizing peace with a gender perspective
SO JOURNAL OF AGGRESSION CONFLICT AND PEACE RESEARCH
AB Purpose This paper aims to analyze a decolonized peace with gender perspective. Liberal democracies had consolidated on conquest, slavery, racism, sexism, colonialism, raw material extraction and female exploitation. Additional burdens came from neoliberal globalization with the massive burning of fossil oil, changing the Earth's history from the Holocene toward the Anthropocene. Multiple nexus between the human and environmental system requires an epistemology from the Global South. The paper explores alternative peace paradigms enabling poor and exploited people to overcome the destructive outcomes of patriarchal violence and extractivism. Regionally and locally, they are experimenting with just, safe, equal and sustainable alternatives of free societies. Design/methodology/approach The nexus approach focuses on system efficiency, internal and external feedbacks and allows decision-making processes with stronger cross-sectoral coordination and multi-level governance. It includes the understanding of the policy agenda and the political actors at different levels, explaining the discrimination of gender from local to global. The analysis establishes complex relations between theory and political actions, due that all actions are inherently mediated by gender. A key focus is a relationship and the outcomes of policies, where communication and collaboration at the local level grant efficient peaceful resource management with gender equity. Findings An engendered-sustainable peace approach is culturally decentralized and may offer alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism and violence. Drastic systemic change requires massive changes from bottom-up and top-down before 2030-2050. Global solidarity among all excluded people, especially women and girls, promotes from childhood an engendered-sustainable peace-building process, where positive feedbacks may reduce the tipping points on Earth and among humankind. Engendered-sustainable peace can mitigate the upcoming conflicts and catastrophes, limiting the negative feedbacks from abusive, selfish and destructive corporations. A greater self-regulating sustainable system with a HUGE-security could promote a decolonized, engendered and sustainable peace for everybody. Research limitations/implications The interconnected risks are cascading across different domains, where systemic challenges have intensified conflicts and violence, due to uncertainty, instability and fragility. Cascading effects not only demand prevention for sudden disruptions (hurricanes, floods) but also for slow-ongoing processes (drought, sea-level rise, lack of water availability, etc.), which are equally or more disruptive. Women suffer differently from disasters and are prone to greater impacts on their life and livelihood. An engendered peace is limited by the deep engrained patriarchal system. Only a culture of peace with gender recognition may grant future peace and also the sustainable care of ecosystems. Practical implications The Global South is exploring alternative ways to overcome the present violent and destructive globalization by promoting deep engrained indigenous values of Aymaras' living well, the shell model of commanding by obeying of the Zapatistas or Bhutan's Happiness Index. Globally, critical women and men are promoting subsistence agriculture, solidarity or gift economy, where local efforts are restoring the equilibrium between humans and nature.
   An engendered-sustainable peace is limiting the destructive impacts of the Anthropocene, climate change and ongoing pandemics.
   Social implications An engendered-sustainable peace is culturally decentralized and offers alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism, climate change and violence. The text explores how to overcome the present hybrid warfare with alternative HUGE security and peace from the bottom-up. Regional reinforcement of food security, safe water management, local jobs and a concordian economy for the most vulnerable may change the present exploitation of nature and humankind. Growing solidarity with people affected by disasters is empowering women and girls and dismantling from the bottom-up, the dominant structures of violence and exploitation. Originality/value The military-industrial-scientific corporate complex and the exploitation of women, men and natural resources, based on patriarchy, has produced climate change, poverty and global pandemics with millions of unnecessary deaths and suffering. A doughnut engendered peace looking from the outside and inside of the system of globalization and environmental destruction proposes to overcome the growth addiction by a growth agnostic society. Engendered peace explores alternative and sustainable values that go beyond the dominant technological changes. It includes a culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained model where everybody is a participant, reinforcing an engendered-sustainable peace and security for everybody.

TI Terrorist offences and international humanitarian law: The armed
   conflict exclusion clause
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS
AB While armed conflicts are principally governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), activities of members of non-State armed groups and their affiliates may also qualify as terrorist offences. After explaining why the concurrent application of IHL and criminal law instruments on terrorism causes friction, this article analyzes the chief mechanism for dissipating this friction: a clause excluding activities governed by IHL from the scope of criminal law instruments on terrorism. Such armed conflict exclusion clauses exist at the international, regional and national level. This article explains how an exclusion clause can best avoid friction between IHL and criminal law instruments on terrorism.

TI Internal armed conflict and environment in Colombia: analysis from
   ecological conflicts, 1960-2016
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
AB Based on an exploratory literature review and records in the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (https://ejatlas.org), this article analyzes 82 cases of environmental conflicts involving actors linked to the Internal Armed Conflict (CAI by its Spanish acronym) in Colombia. Using descriptive statistics, we analyzed the war and extractive actions, and the socio-environmental implications of the CAI in the cases studied. We distinguish the actors linked to the armed conflict, the modalities of violence, the impacts on ecosystems, and the most affected population groups between 1960 and 2016. We found that the intensive use of violence associated with CAI is a particularity that differentiates extractivism in Colombia from other Latin American countries. The CAI generated forced displacement, which in turn facilitated territorial control, appropriation of land and its resources, and advancement of extractivism. That these economic activities have the most intensive impacts on the environment, human rights, and vulnerable communities confirms this relationship. These activities correspond to biomass and land exploitation, mining, and fossil fuels extraction. In terms of environmental assets, we identified that forests and water ecosystems were the most affected. Moreover, three out of four cases analyzed show that the ethnic population was intensively harmed, evidence of a critical dimension of environmental racism in the armed conflict in Colombia.

TI Tracking Underreported Financial Flows: China's Development Finance and
   the Aid-Conflict Nexus Revisited
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB China's provision of development finance to other countries is sizable but reliable information is scarce. We introduce a new open-source methodology for collecting project-level development finance information and create a database of Chinese official finance (OF) to Africa from 2000 to 2011. We find that China's commitments amounted to approximately US$73 billion, of which US$15 billion are comparable to Official Development Assistance following Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development definitions. We provide details on 1,511 projects to fifty African countries. We use this database to extend previous research on aid and conflict, which suffers from omitted-variable bias due to the exclusion of Chinese development finance. Our results show that sudden withdrawals of 'traditional'' aid no longer induce conflict in the presence of sufficient alternative funding from China. Our findings highlight the importance of gathering more complete data on the development activities of 'nontraditional donors'' to better understand the link between aid and conflict.

Data collection on contentious politics, including civil war, terrorism, and protest has proceeded at a rapid pace over the last several years. This special section develops a set of best practices and offers advice to those involved in collecting conflict data as well as those who are regular users of such data. In this introduction, the process of data collection is considered, including source selection, information extraction or 'coding', and data sharing. A set of six rules is offered, which will hopefully guide others as they compile quantitative data on conflict processes.

AB Information technology governance are rules and regulation established by management to ensure that practitioners use IT infrastructure in an effective and efficient manner, but with the increase of energy consumption and environmental impact associated with IT infrastructure and services, energy efficiency and the concern for the environmental is becoming a critical concern in management implementing IT governance strategies. Thus there is need for a model that can assist management in making decisions on how to realize a sustainable IT governance strategy in their organisations. Therefore this paper proposed an agent based Green decision making model for sustainable information technology governance. The methodology adopted in this paper involves the synthesis and extraction of secondary data from existing literatures. The proposed model comprises of Green decision making variables, Green process, multi-software agents and knowledge base aimed to establish a sustainable IT governance strategy in organisations. Findings from this research paper shows that the developed model can assist management in making decisions related to Green and sustainable practices with the support from multi-software agents to assist management in IT governance implementation. The developed model can be used as a guide to management in attaining a Green and sustainable organisation.

TI Aid with Blinkers: Environmental Governance of Uranium Mining in Niger
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The role of development cooperation in fostering improved environmental governance of extractive industries in African countries exposed to the expanding global uranium frontier remains ambiguous. With primary data, this paper demonstrates how foreign aid to Niger has ignored grievances on grave environmental impacts and rampant institutional failures while a crisis discourse on desertification and food insecurity diverts attention from geopolitical interests in mineral wealth. We argue that aid delivery remains insufficient to address structural deficiencies cemented by decades of investment-friendly 'politics of mining' and conclude that domestic reforms must be backed by stronger transnational accountability mechanisms to overcome corporate impunity.

TI Community Monitoring of Natural Resource Systems and the Environment
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES
AB Community monitoring can track environmental phenomena, resource use, and natural resource management processes of concern to community members. It can also contribute to planning and decision-making and empower community members in resource management. While community monitoring that addresses the environmental crisis is growing, it also gathers data on other global challenges: climate change, social welfare, and health. Some environmental community monitoring programs are challenged by limited collective action and community participation, insufficient state responsiveness to data and proposals, and lack of sustainability over time. Additionally, community members monitoring the environment are increasingly harassed and sometimes killed. Community monitoring is more effective with improved data collection, improved data management and sharing, and stronger efforts to meet community information needs, enable conflict resolution, and strengthen self-determination. Other promising areas for development are further incorporating governance issues, embracing integrated approaches at the community level, and establishing stronger links to national and global frameworks.

AB Purpose -This study will look at the relationship between norms on gender equality on the one hand and the level of gender equality in the political and socioeconomic sphere, the presence or absence of armed conflict, and general peacefulness on the other.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data on gender equality norms from the World Values Surveys, political and socioeconomic gender equality from the Global Gender Gap Index, armed conflict from the Uppsala Conflict Data Base, and general peacefulness from the Global Peace Index are analyzed in a bivariate correlation.
   Findings - The results show a significant association between norms on and attitudes toward gender equality and levels of political and socioeconomic gender equality, absence or presence of armed conflict, and level of general peacefulness.
   Research limitations - There is no data base on norms on and attitudes toward the use of violence which is why only levels of violence are included in the study.
   Social implications - The study shows that governments, aid agencies, NGOs and others working on conflict prevention and peace building need to focus on improving gender equality in order to achieve a sustainable decrease in conflict levels and an improvement in general levels of peacefulness.
   Originality/value - This study is original in that it looks at norms on gender equality on the individual level on the one hand and actual levels of both gender equality and violence in the society, including armed conflict on the other.

TI Exploring challenges, threats and innovations in global health promotion
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
AB Global health faces a broad spectrum of old and new challenges. Besides epidemiological problems, political conflicts, economic crisis and austerity policies are jeopardizing progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), affecting the most vulnerable populations. During the 22nd International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) World Conference on Health Promotion held in Curitiba, Brazil, in 2016, challenges and threats for global health, in addition to a wide range of innovative experiences in health promotion, were discussed with participants from 65 countries. At the end of the conference, a public statement was approved claiming for Democracy and Human Rights in all countries around the world as essential conditions for the promotion of health and equity. In this paper, we explore challenges, threats and innovations in global health promotion. We use scientific literature, analysis of the current situation of the Brazilian health system, and material presented during the 22nd IUHPE World Conference. Also, we discuss strategies to strengthen health systems, policies and practices through the approach of STI and illustrative local experiences presented at the congress mentioned above, including examples developed in the city of Curitiba. We conclude that STI is crucial to support strengthening local health systems, design effective intersectoral public policies, scaling up innovative initiates, and skilling staff in addressing the contemporary challenges. Finally, the Declaration of the 22nd World Conference on Health Promotion of the IUHPE is a fundamental policy statement based on the prioritization of democracy and human rights as essential conditions for the promotion of health and equity.

SO JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
AB Practices of denunciation are at once ubiquitous and marginalised in literature on the Guatemalan armed conflict. Meanwhile, ordinary Guatemalans who spontaneously denounced neighbours, former friends and fellow villagers have largely escaped scrutiny in scholarly work on low-level perpetrators. Departing from untapped confidential documents in the Historical Archive of the National Police, this article provides the first archival study of denunciatory behaviour during the Guatemalan Civil War, specifically at the height of the conflict (1970-85). This contribution reveals both the strategic considerations that spurred state intelligence apparatuses to elicit civilian information as well as the broad range of personal, opportunistic and strategic motives that drove civilians to denounce. The case study questions scholarly consensus on the spontaneous and voluntary character of denunciation by arguing that besides providing novel pathways for opportunistic action, denunciations also opened up new strategies for survival in the face of a civil war that structured available choices.

TI The Imperative to Explore the Impact of Disarmament on Peacemaking
   Efforts and Conflict Recurrence
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB There is today a well-established consensus that belligerents must be disarmed in order to reconstruct shattered states and establish a robust and durable peace in the wake of internal armed conflict. Indeed, nearly every UN peacekeeping intervention since the end of the Cold War has included disarmament provisions in its mandate. Disarmament is guided by the arrestingly simple premise that weapons cause conflict and, therefore, must be eradicated for a civil conflict to end. If the means by which combatants fight are eliminated, it is thought, actors will have little choice but to commit to peace. Disarmament is, therefore, considered a necessary condition for establishing the lasting conditions for peace. To date, however, no systematic quantitative analysis has been undertaken of the practice of disarmament and the causal mechanisms remain underspecified. This paper is a preliminary attempt to fill that gap. In it we outline a series of hypotheses with which to run future statistical analyses on the effects of disarmament programs. The success of negotiations and the durability of peace are, perhaps, the single most salient issues concerning those engaged in conflict termination efforts. We therefore focus the bulk of this paper on a review of the supposed effects of disarmament on negotiating outcomes and war recurrence.

TI Gender Disparities in Post-Conflict Societies: A Cross-National Analysis
SO FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB This article investigates the impacts of conflict, resolution, and post-conflict democracy on gender bias. Exploring this question poses two methodological concerns. The first regards selection bias in which countries experience conflict and its resolution. The study addresses this issue using a generalization of the Heckman procedure. The second is that post-conflict democracy is likely endogenous to the level of pre-conflict democracy. This issue is addressed using two-stage least squares. Results show that conflict unambiguously worsens gender outcomes with respect to secondary school enrollment, labor force participation, fertility, and parliamentary representation. However, it does not affect the gap in life expectancy. Conflict resolution improves gender outcomes significantly, but not always by a magnitude that restores pre-conflict levels of equality. Greater post-conflict democratization improves parliamentary representation of women and the gender gaps in life expectancy and secondary school enrollment. However, it worsens the gap in labor force participation.

TI The Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED): A new dataset on the promises
   and practices of power-sharing in post-conflict countries
SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Past research on the relationship between power-sharing arrangements and the recurrence of civil conflict has primarily analyzed the promises of power-sharing stipulated in peace agreements. What happens afterwards, however, has not yet been sufficiently explored. This represents a major research gap, as the actual practices of power-sharing in post-conflict countries are likely to be influential in the possibility of civil conflict recurring. To address this shortcoming, we present a new global dataset on the promises and practices of power-sharing between the government of a state and former rebels in post-conflict countries. The collected data captures if, when and how power-sharing institutions have been promised and/or put into place, and whether they have subsequently been modified or abolished. The dataset encompasses every peace agreement signed after the cessation of a civil conflict in the years between 1989 and 2006, and covers a five-year period after the signature of each of these agreements (unless violence recurred earlier). The unit of analysis is the government-rebel dyad during the post-conflict period and data is recorded in an event data format. A first analysis of the Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) reveals that the effects of the promises of power-sharing on civil conflict recurrence follow a different logic than the effects of their practices. This finding emphasizes the necessity for in-depth analyses of post-conflict situations for which the PSED provides the necessary data.

TI Colombian People's Willingness to Forgive Offenses against Women
   Perpetrated during the Armed Conflict
SO REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE PSICOLOGIA
AB We examined the Colombian people's positions on forgiving perpetrators of offenses against women during the armed conflict, and the relationship between willingness to forgive and attitudes towards the peace process. The majority of participants (61%) were quite unwilling to forgive. Among participants who were not completely hostile, three positions were found. For 18%, forgiving mainly depended on the type of crime, for 8%, it depended on the subsequent apologetic behaviour, and for 8%, forgiving was unconditional. Participants who did not reject the possibility of forgiveness expressed significantly more positive views regarding the current peace process than participants who expressed rejection.

TI Learning from a Peace Process: Theory, Practice and the Case of Northern
   Ireland
SO GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION
AB The goal of 'learning' from peace processes is widely expressed in conflict resolution scholarship and practice but inadequately understood. This article investigates what kinds of knowledge can be learned from a peace process, the theoretical and methodological bases of such learning, and what impact it may have. The article begins with an interdisciplinary discussion of reasons to learn, the kinds of lessons proposed in the peace process literature and how theories of learning may be applied to a peace process. Following this is a case study of the sharing of the Northern Ireland peacemaking experience with other conflict-affected societies, especially through facilitated dialogues between decision-makers. This contributes to a comprehensive ideal model of learning from peace processes - something which, it is argued, may result in 'transformative learning' and a 'policy paradigm shift' towards de-escalatory conflict management. A definition of a peace process 'lesson' is offered to guide future research.

TI Conflict and diarrheal and related diseases: A global analysis
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB The purpose of this study was to determine the association between deaths owing to terrorism, civil war and one-sided violence from 1994-2000 and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to diarrheal and related diseases, schistosomiasis, trachoma and the nematode infections (DSTN diseases) in 2002 among World Health Organization Member States. Deaths resulting from terrorism, civil war and one-sided violence were significantly related to DSTN DALYs across the majority of sex age subgroups of the populace, after controlling for baseline levels of improved water/sanitation and a variety of economic measures: overall, a 1.0% increase in deaths owing to terrorism and related violence was associated with an increase of 0.16% in DALYs lost to DSTN diseases. Associations were greatest among 0-to-4-year olds. The results of the present study suggest that DSTN disease control efforts should target conflict-affected populations with particular attention to young children who suffer disproportionately from DSTN diseases in these settings. In view of the evidence that terrorism and related violence may influence DSTN DALYs in the longer term, control strategies should move beyond immediate responses to decrease the incidence and severity of DSTN diseases to seek solutions through bolstering health systems infrastructure development among conflict affected populations.

TI Who corrupts whom? A criminal eco-system made in Italy
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This research note focuses on the relationship between organised crime and corruption in Italy. It is part of a wider research project investigating that relationship across a number of European countries. In the first part of this contribution, along with a brief account of definitional issues, a summary review of previous work on the connections between organised crime and corruption is provided. The paper then attempts to delineate the uniqueness of the Italian case through some observations around the specific contours of organised and corrupt exchange in the country as they manifest themselves. After a brief methodological note, the analysis is interspersed with the opinions of key informants contacted for this research who have profound knowledge of the subject matter, having worked for many years as investigating judges or academic researchers. A division into areas in which the links between organised crime and corruption are observed tries to map the two phenomena and their joint modus operandi.

TI Legislative Gender Diversity and the Resolution of Civil Conflict
SO POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB Policy makers and scholars have shown increased interest in gendered approaches to peacemaking, even as evidence of women's impact on peace processes has remained unclear. In this paper, we explore the influence of gender diversity among decision-making elites on the outcome of ongoing civil conflicts. Specifically, we argue that increased female representation within the national legislature increases the likelihood that a conflict terminates in a negotiated settlement. However, the impact of legislative female representation on conflict termination is conditioned by the power of the legislature vis-a-vis the executive, suggesting that gender diversity exerts a greater impact in states with more authoritative legislatures. We evaluate our hypotheses using data on the manner of conflict termination and the proportion of women in national legislatures between 1945 and 2009. Our results show support for the central argument, suggesting that increasing female representation within legislative bodies increases the likelihood of war termination via negotiated settlement.

TI Carbon flows, financial markets and climate change mitigation Original
   Research Article
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB After initial debates and controversies, from the late 1980s onwards market instruments became fully accepted in environmental governance. However, with their inclusion in transnational and global environmental governance, market institutions seem to be in for a new round of discussions. Transnational carbon markets stand out in these debates, especially since the recent financial crisis made the world aware of the vulnerability of global financial markets. This paper uses a sociology of flows perspective to review current debates on the emerging global carbon markets as new initially state-created institutions to mitigate climate change. Do carbon markets aim primarily at climate change mitigation or mainly at financial gains? Who controls the functioning and outcome of these transnational carbon markets? And is there a risk of a global carbon market crisis, not unlike the global financial crisis? The paper concludes that current discussions and decisions on carbon market architectures are conducive for the future role of carbon markets in climate change mitigation. States are just one of the many actors shaping carbon markets and thus managing carbon flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Causes of civil war in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa: A comparison
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
AB Objectives. This article explores the extent to which economic development, ethnic and religious fractionalization, domestic governance, and international trade openness affect civil war in postcolonial Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 1950 through 1992. Methods. We estimate a set of multivariate logit models with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method for time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. Results. Both in Asia and in SSA, civil war is less likely with increased economic development and trade openness, while mixed autocratic-democratic regimes raise the likelihood that states will experience civil war. Although neither ethnic nor religious fractionalization has any statistically significant effect on civil war in SSA, civil war in Asia is more likely with greater ethnic fractionalization. Conclusions. Despite cross-regional variation in causes of civil war, economic development and trade openness seem to play a consistent role in reducing civil war.

TI What Fosters Enduring Peace? An Analysis of Factors Influencing Civil
   War Resolution
SO PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB In literature on civil war resolution, several factors have been identified that may influence the peace process. In this paper, based on a combination of different datasets and additional information, we explore reasons for the initiation of negotiations and for the shortening of conflict duration based on 82 civil wars that took place between 1944 and 1997. Employing logistic regression, supplemented by graphical explorations, we demonstrate that the existence of a "mutual hurting stalemate" and partial instead of neutral intervention increase the probability that negotiations set in. In addition to this, somewhat counter-intuitively, our analysis shows that a larger number of warring parties compared to conflicts based on two rival groups - enhance prospects that negotiations are conducted. This may partially be due to the fact that conflicting parties fear they may be excluded from negotiations on a potential settlement and with this, are more ready to engage in the bargaining process. The occurrence of a military stalemate in the course of a conflict, as our analysis based on proportional hazards survival regression demonstrates, shortens war duration. We put forward the idea that partial intervention to support the weaker party can create mutual hurting stalemates, and in this way, contribute to the ending of civil war. Our study partially confirms work in which the ripeness of a conflict or the existence of a mutual hurting stalemate was found to crucially affect prospects for conflict resolution, but also offers new insights into these themes.

TI Rebel group formation in Africa: Evidence from a new dataset
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Theories of internal armed conflict onset often conceptualize an eruption emerging from pre-existing, non-violent opposition movements or organizations. This paper argues that this is not the most common pathway to armed conflict in Africa. It introduces new data on rebel group formation in 47 African states (1997-2015) that offers a more complete picture than existing conflict datasets; about two-thirds of the groups in the new dataset are not named in standard conflict datasets. The strong majority of these rebel groups formed in rural areas; did not emerge from nearby protest movements or civil society organizations; and initially did not benefit from substantial material resources nor commit large-scale violence. Analyses suggest that rebel groups forming in rural parts of African states draw less often on pre-war, public, non-violent contestation than those of urban areas. The paper highlights the need for more theory on the varied pathways to internal armed conflict, and the importance of - and challenges of collecting - systematic evidence on armed group formation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While terrorist and insurgent groups have often combined anti-state subversion with purely criminal activities in order to obtain the financial means to wage their ideological struggle, little is known about the transformation of such groups into non-ideological organised crime groups (OCG) with close links to authorities. This holds particularly for jihadist groups that have on ideological grounds ruled out collaboration with their archenemies - infidels' and apostates'. Using unique ethnographic data from Russia's Dagestan, this article explores the causes and contexts of the gradual transformation of some of Dagestan's jihadist units - jamaats - into organised crime groups collaborating with local authorities.

AB Teaching environmental law and climate change issues one may open a number of questions on relations between environmental protection, governmental duties and public rights, starting with: has a government duty to care and maintain a dissent environment and stable climate conditions?; what is a ground for governmental decision-making on actions threatening sustainability of the climate conditions?; where is the beginning and the end of the responsibility of an individual or of an country? The article outlines the elements that provide the criteria under which one may discus on whether it should be the court to force the government to act or should it be a parliament to set laws initiating actions to protect citizens and their human rights from irreversible climate change? The article points out the recent cases State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation (court decision from December 2019) and Kelsey Cascadia Rose Juliana v. USA (court decision from January 2020). In Urgenda, the court concerned questions: whether the Netherlands is obliged to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from its soil by at least 25% by the end of 2020 compared to 1990, whether the court can order the State to do so and whether the government is bound to protect human rights in climate crisis? In Juliana, a group of children between the ages of eight and nineteen filed suit against the federal government, claiming that the government violated their constitutional rights by causing dangerous carbon dioxide concentrations. Although the court had found the injury and evidence on causation between government's actions and climate crisis, it found a lack of redressability. The aim of the article is to examine if the concepts of European Green Deal presented on January 2019 by the Von der Leyen Commission to enshrine the 2050 climate neutrality target into life are in line with conclusions from analysed cases and lessons learned from COVID-19 crisis.

In these conditions, a conventional division between international and domestic issues, and between normative and explanatory theory, becomes less tenable, raising corresponding issues of legitimacy, community, and ethics. This chapter assesses liberal environmentalism in terms of a normative theory that considers requirements of authority, epistemic validity, good practices, and practical reason.

TI Corruption in the public health sector in South Africa: A global
   bioethical perspective
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
AB It is clear that corruption as the abuse of power is an enormous bioethical issue in the public health sector in SA, but as a challenge, it has not elicited much discussion from a global bioethical perspective. The Universal Declaration of Bioethics and Human Rights (UDBHR) on corruption considers three matters. First, the existence of corruption as a problem of power is recognised in the health environment and condemned (article 18). Second, corruption is indicated as an immoral phenomenon that harms the interests of the patient (article 4), ignores vulnerable people (article 8) and neglects social responsibility (article 14). Third, it can be concluded that the UDBHR expresses the opinion that corruption has to be combated by a process of ethical decision-making (article 18.2-3), the use of ethics committees (article 19) and ethics education (article 23.1).

AB In the last two decades, the 2008 Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus and the 2016 algal blooms crises have placed the Chilean salmon industry at risk and tested the capacity of its governance mechanisms to solve environmental and economic contradictions and ensure the industry's continuity and its sustainability. Although in the 2008 crisis the state redefined mechanisms of property, control and access to natural resources to strengthen the resilience of the salmon industry, the lessons learned by the system and the community between one crisis and the next were not enough to avoid a new crisis. Chile's existing governance mechanisms are reactive and not proactive and, therefore, their capacity to lead the industry towards long-term sustainable practices is flawed.

TI Simulative governance: on the collaborative narrative of civil society
   participation in the CDM stakeholder framework
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is often cited as an exemplar of new, hybrid forms of global environmental governance operating at the public-private interface. Practically, enacting this arrangement involves a wide range of non-state actors. This broad involvement is here assumed to mark a shift towards more polycentric and networked modes of governance in which agents collaborate as 'stakeholders' in the process of consensual rule-setting and implementation. Using post-political critique, the depoliticising effects of the stakeholder framework on civil society actors are interrogated, using formal and informal participation opportunities to raise concerns regarding specific CDM projects. The analysis suggests that the CDM's collaborative narrative of stakeholding structurally fails to stimulate public (re)engagement and is, instead, a prime example of simulative governance that struggles to achieve the simultaneity of two incompatibilities: the participatory revolution and the post-political turn.

TI From Blueprints to Empowerment of Disadvantaged Groups in Natural
   Resource Governance: Lessons from Nepal and Tanzania
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB Though there is an increasing trend of natural resources governed by local communities, disadvantaged groups who are highly dependent on natural resources are still far behind in terms of being involved in the natural resource governance. When the wider public is included in decision-making in natural resources governance, the ways in which people protect and cope with the changing environment in their daily lives are exposed and can advance the search for alternatives in sustainable development. This paper compares natural resources governance interventions in Nepal and Tanzania, and searches for differences and similarities in the patterns of engagement of disadvantaged groups. The special focus is on Dalits in Nepal and rural women in Tanzania. The study reveals that though disadvantaged groups are included in principle, in practice their special needs are not taken into consideration. Our findings indicate that the formal possibilities for engagement do not provide citizens with sufficient and equal space for meaningfully participation. The theoretical background of the paper builds on two approaches of engagement: Chamber's view of power at the grassroots and Fung and Wright's thoughts on empowerment.

TI Strengthening multilevel governance of public goods through democratic
   and republican constitutionalism*
SO CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL
AB Russia's invasions of Ukraine confirm the historical experience that governance of public goods (PGs) demanded by citizens (such as human rights, democratic peace, and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as universally confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly) depends on defending principles of democratic constitutionalism (such as citizenship, democratic governance, `mixed government', and courts of justice), republican constitutionalism (such as separation of power, the rule of law, and jus gentium since ancient Rome), and common law constitutionalism (such as parliamentary and judicial protection of fundamental rights and property rights) against abuses of power. The United Nations (UN) and its 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda recommend these constitutional principles also for multilevel governance protecting the SDGs and related PGs. Yet constitutionalism depends on multilevel legislative, administrative and judicial implementing measures transforming the SDGs into concrete duties of governments and corresponding rights and remedies of citizens. The global health, environmental, energy, security, economic and human rights crises reveal the systemic `market failures', `governance failures', and `constitutional implementation deficits' undermining UN and World Trade Organization governance of PGs. Liberal order can only survive as `militant constitutional demoi-cracy' if citizens defend freedom against tyranny at home and abroad, notably in authoritarian States which, notwithstanding their formal constitutions, suppress democratic constitutionalism.

TI Street level bureaucracy in response to environmental pressure. Insights
   from forestry and urban green space governance in Poland
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE
AB Forestry and urban green space governance experiences rapid changes due to bottom up environmental pressure and top down changes of legislation. To deepen our understanding of crafting preferable environmental reactions towards environmental pressure, we introduced the perspective of environmental street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) and explored it using Oliver's strategic response framework. Drawing from case studies on the governance of the moose and urban green space in Poland, we investigated the complex and mediating sphere of SLB "policy intentions" in environmental governance. We argue that SLBs can distance themselves from new expectations if these are perceived as "socially constructed" and potentially disturbing for SLBs' professional routines. Such limited or moderated reactions can be a coping mechanism of SLBs trying to balance a complex landscape of various, even contradictory pressures. Our findings break the monolithic-type image of a 'decision-maker' into complex web of interrelations between administrative units and political structures. They also suggest a need of new forms of environmental (post-) bureaucracy to reinforce social trust and to deal with ambiguities of nature.

TI Performance evaluation of urban environmental governance in Anhui
   Province based on spatial and temporal differentiation analyses
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB When the process of urbanization has brought economic benefits in the Yangtze River Delta of China, environmental pollution becomes increasingly prominent. In order to achieve integrated sustainable green development and reduce the gap in environmental governance performance between regions, this study analyzed the environmental issues of provincial cities in Anhui Province from 2013 to 2017 in the urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. Governance performance is analyzed and the evaluation index system framework is determined using the "pressure-state-response" model with the panel and spatial data. Based on the global principal component analysis method and spatial autocorrelation analysis, the environmental governance performance of Anhui Province has generally increased steadily from 2013 to 2017. The situation in northern Anhui is still developing in a good state. Southern Anhui is in a trend of rising first and then stabilizing, whereas central Anhui has a downward trend after a rapid rise; in terms of the spatial pattern, the overall situation is central Anhui > northern Anhui > southern Anhui. The urban spatial distribution pattern of the region shows a positive spatial correlation. Particularly, the performance levels of Maanshan City and Huainan City have been at a poor level for a long time, whereas Hefei and Huangshan have strong comprehensive environmental governance capabilities with average efficiency values of 0.55 and 0.47, respectively. Corresponding countermeasures have been proposed to rectify polluting enterprises and optimize structure of industries, increase scientific and technological investment and infrastructure construction, strengthen the radiation driving effects, and establish a pollution monitoring system. Based on all the analyses and resulted findings, we concluded the study with corresponding policy implications/suggestions and recommended countermeasures.

TI GUATEMALA: THE FIGHT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW
SO REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA
AB Guatemala's political system has been shaken by corruption scandals over the past two years. In large part, the country's political system has been consumed by efforts to fight impunity for corruption and human rights abuses. In 2015 voters elected Jimmy Morales to the presidency on an anti-corruption platform, hopeful for change from a political outsider. Throughout 2016 some advances were achieved in the fight against corruption, and prosecutors won several high-profile convictions for human rights violations that occurred during the country's civil war. But organized criminal networks continued to operate in the country, posing serious challenges to the rule of law, and both the Morales administration and the new Congress displayed some of the same shortcomings as previous governments.

TI Making room and moving over: knowledge co-production, Indigenous
   knowledge sovereignty and the politics of global environmental change
   decision-making
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The global environmental change research community that engages with Indigenous knowledge holders commonly practice engagement in an extractive way: knowledge is treated as data that can be aggregated and understood in abstract and universal form. This assumes that knowledge and governance are separate and gives knowledge co-production the appearance of playing an informative and facilitative role in global environmental change governance. But seeking Indigenous knowledge to inform environmental decision-making implies that Indigenous peoples are stakeholders as opposed to self-determining nations with rights and responsibilities regarding their knowledge systems and lands. Indigenous sovereignty is not respected when knowledge is treated as mere data for collective decision-making. This paper brings literatures on knowledge co-production together with Indigenous knowledge, research, and environmental governance to explain why co-production scholars must move away from seeking to better 'integrate' Indigenous knowledges into western science and make way for Indigenous research leadership.

TI A systematic review on tobacco use among civilian populations affected
   by armed conflict
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
AB Objective To systematically examine evidence on tobacco use among conflict-affected civilian populations.
   Data sources Primary quantitative and qualitative studies published in English up to April 2014. Bibliographic databases searched were EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane; with the main terms of: (Smoke*, tobacco*, cigarette*, nicotine, beedi, bidi, papirosi, dip, chew, snuff, snus, smokeless tobacco) AND (armed-conflict, conflict-affected, conflict, war, refugee, internally displaced, forcibly displaced, asylum, humanitarian). Grey literature was searched using humanitarian databases, websites and search engines.
   Study selection Studies were independently selected by two reviewers, with a study outcome of tobacco use and a population of conflict-affected civilian populations such as internally displaced persons, refugees, residents in conflict-affected areas, residents and returning forcibly displaced populations returning in stabilised and postconflict periods. 2863 studies were initially identified.
   Data extraction Data were independently extracted. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies were used to assess study quality.
   Data synthesis 39 studies met inclusion criteria and descriptive analysis was used. Findings were equivocal on the effect of conflict on tobacco use. Evidence was clearer on associations between post-traumatic stress and other mental disorders with nicotine dependence. However, there were too few studies for definitive conclusions. No study examined the effectiveness of tobacco-related interventions. The quantitative studies were moderate (N=13) or weak (N=22) quality, and qualitative studies were moderate (N=3) or strong (N=2).
   Conclusions Some evidence indicates links between conflict and tobacco use but substantially more research is required.

TI Brexit and trade policy: an analysis of the governance of UK trade
   policy and what it means for health and social justice
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background There is an extensive body of research demonstrating that trade and globalisation can have wide-ranging implications for health. Robust governance is key to ensuring that health, social justice and sustainability are key considerations within trade policy, and that health risks from trade are effectively mitigated and benefits are maximised. The UK's departure from the EU provides a rare opportunity to examine a context where trade governance arrangements are being created anew, and to explore the consequences of governance choices and structures for health and social justice. Despite its importance to public health, there has been no systematic analysis of the implications of UK trade policy governance. We therefore conducted an analysis of the governance of the UK's trade policy from a public health and social justice perspective. Results Several arrangements required for good governance appear to have been implemented - information provision, public consultation, accountability to Parliament, and strengthening of civil service capacity. However, our detailed analyses of these pillars of governance identified significant weaknesses in each of these areas. Conclusion The establishment of a new trade policy agenda calls for robust systems of governance. However, our analysis demonstrates that, despite decades of mounting evidence on the health and equity impacts of trade and the importance of strong systems of governance, the UK government has largely ignored this evidence and failed to galvanise the opportunity to include public health and equity considerations and strengthen democratic involvement in trade policy. This underscores the point that the evidence alone will not guarantee that health and justice are prioritised. Rather, we need strong systems of governance everywhere that can help seize the health benefits of international trade and minimise its detrimental impacts. A failure to strengthen governance risks poor policy design and implementation, with unintended and inequitable distribution of harms, and 'on-paper' commitments to health, social justice, and democracy unfulfilled in practice. Although the detailed findings relate to the situation in the UK, the issues raised are, we believe, of wider relevance for those with an interest of governing for health in the area of international trade.

TI SRI LANKA: ETHNIC CONFLICT AND THE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
SO COOPERATION FOR A PEACEFUL AND SUSTAINABLE WORLD, PT 2
SE Contributions to Conflict Management Peace Economics and Development
AB This chapter presents a critique of the so-called peace process through military action within the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict. There is a need to study this problem from the psychological, developmental, and humanitarian point of view. This chapter analyses the deep-rooted seeds of the problem, its historical background, its various domestic and international angles and perceptions, and the international angles as well as regional implications of the Sri Lankan Tamil insurgency. The nature of the problem, the effect of ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka on regional security, and the militarily remedization of the problem by Sri Lankan government and its result are focused on here.
   Finally, the study identifies the contemporary role of diaspora communities as a severe hindrance to a lasting peace in the country. Thus, the analysis concludes that lasting peace in the island is possible only through the promotion of a genuine liberal democracy, from both within and without. Suggestions for future peace, stability, and development have been put forward.

TI Transparent autocracies: The Extractive Industries Transparency
   Initiative (EITI) and civil society in authoritarian states
SO EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a public-private partnership that aims to set a global standard in resource management. The EITI has a unique format that requires an active civil society to be part of the resource management process. At the moment, 51 resource-rich countries implement the initiative, including many non-democracies. Building up on the literatures on the resource curse, democratization, norm diffusion and compliance, this paper addresses a critical question: Can the EITI be truly successful in incorporating civil society groups into the decision making process in non-democratic countries? Based on case studies of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, it argues that while on paper civil society groups are part of the national multi-stakeholder process, in practice independent NGOs are finding it more and more difficult to exercise their monitoring and whistleblowing capacities due to political, technical, financial and bureaucratic constraints. In addition, the statistical analysis shows that EITI membership is not correlated with better civil and associational rights in authoritarian countries. These results confirm that despite the initial euphoria regarding civil society participation in the EITI, NGOs remain the weakest link in majority of EITI-implementing states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Politics and Parasites: The Contribution of Corruption to Human Misery
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB We address the consequences of corruption within a state on the extent to which populations have shortened life expectancy due to political corruption. Using three variables to estimate corruption, the results support the expectation that corruption increases average disability shortened life years (DALY). The results persist when estimating the model including measures of deaths from civil war and the number of bordering states experiencing civil war, both previously shown to have an effect on DALY, although these two variables are not statistically significant in our models. While the estimated effects of the corruption variables continue to capture much of the variation in DALY for a global group of nations, they completely fail to explain any variation in Sub-Saharan African states, probably because of the devastating effects of AIDS and malaria in that region. Finally, we discuss why this failure occurs and discuss the implications of our results.

TI Tightening the grip: environmental governance under Xi Jinping
   INTRODUCTION
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB In the space of a few years, China's global image with regard to environmental matters has significantly improved. Particularly since Xi Jinping's coming-to-power in 2012 China's reputation in the global climate change regime has improved markedly and it has gained accolades for a new determination to reverse environmental degradation at home. China's incipient green transformation is partly due to a new actor constellation in environmental governance, a striking feature of which is the prominence of ad hoc campaigns that offer quick results but that may undermine the creation of law-based enforcement mechanisms in the long term. Another development - China's increasing use of emerging technologies and big data analytics - has given rise to new forms of government-business alliances. These new players and innovative approaches have injected momentum into China's environmental governance system and suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, authoritarian regimes can be responsive to citizen demands under certain circumstances. Yet it remains to be seen whether long-term environmental goals can be met, due to a pervasive lack of accountability, the weakening of civil society and heavy constraints on public participation.

TI Urban health: an example of a "health in all policies" approach in the
   context of SDGs implementation
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: Cities are an important driving force to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda. The SDGs provide an operational framework to consider urbanization globally, while providing local mechanisms for action and careful attention to closing the gaps in the distribution of health gains. While health and well-being are explicitly addressed in SDG 3, health is also present as a pre condition of SDG 11, that aims at inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities.
   Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policy across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. HiAP is key for local decision-making processes in the context of urban policies to promote public health interventions aimed at achieving SDG targets. HiAPs relies heavily on the use of scientific evidence and evaluation tools, such as health impact assessments (HIAs). HIAs may include city-level quantitative burden of disease, health economic assessments, and citizen and other stakeholders' involvement to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies.
   The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)'s Urban Planning, Environment and Health Initiative provides an example of a successful model of translating scientific evidence into policy and practice with regards to sustainable and healthy urban development. The experiences collected through ISGlobal's participation implementing HIAs in several cities worldwide as a way to promote HiAP are the basis for this analysis.
   Aim: The aim of this article is threefold: to understand the links between social determinants of health, environmental exposures, behaviour, health outcomes and urban policies within the SDGs, following a HiAP rationale; to review and analyze the key elements of a HiAP approach as an accelerator of the SDGs in the context of urban and transport planning; and to describe lessons learnt from practical implementation of HIAs in cities across Europe, Africa and Latin-America.
   Methods: We create a comprehensive, urban health related SDGs conceptual framework, by linking already described urban health dimensions to existing SDGs, targets and indicators. We discuss, taking into account the necessary conditions and steps to conduct HiAP, the main barriers and opportunities within the SDGs framework. We conclude by reviewing HIAs in a number of cities worldwide (based on the experiences collected by co-authors of this publication), including city-level quantitative burden of disease and health economic assessments, as practical tools to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies.
   Results: A conceptual framework linking SDGs and urban and transportplanning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health outcomes, following a HiAP rationale, is designed. We found at least 38 SDG targets relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, while 4 important aspects contained in our proposed framework were not present in the SDGs (physical activity, noise, quality of life or social capital). Thus, a more comprehensive HiAP vision within the SDGs could be beneficial.
   Our analysis confirmed that the SDGs framework provides an opportunity to formulate and implement policies with a HiAP approach. Three important aspects are highlighted: 1) the importance of the intersectoral work and health equity as a cross-cutting issue in sustainable development endeavors; 2) policy coherence, health governance, and stakeholders' participation as key issues; and 3) the need for high quality data.
   HIAs are a practical tool to implement HiAP. Opportunities and barriers related to the political, legal and health governance context, the capacity to inform policies in other sectors, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the availability of quality data are discussed based on our experience. Quantitative assessments can provide powerful data such as: estimates of annual preventable morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity, exposure to air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces; the associated economic impacts in health care costs per year; and the number of preventable premature deaths when improvements in urban and transport planning are implemented. This information has been used to support the design of policies that promote cycling, walking, public, zero and low-emitting modes of transport, and the provision of urban greening or healthy public open spaces in Barcelona (e.g. Urban Mobility, Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plans, or the Superblocks's model), the Bus Rapid Transit and Open Streets initiatives in several Latin American cities or targeted SDGs assessments in Morocco.
   Conclusions: By applying tools such as HIA, HiAP can be implemented to inform and improve transport and urban planning to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda. Such a framework could be potentially used in cities worldwide, including those of less developed regions or countries. Data availability, taking into account equity issues, strenghtening the communication between experts, decision makers and citizens, and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial elements for the HiAP approach to translate knowledge into SDG implementation.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB How does interethnic marriage influence the occurrence of ethnic violence in sub-Saharan Africa? Previous studies on the relationship between intergroup contact and conflict onset have produced mixed findings. Some scholars have argued that this might be due to the way interethnic contact is measured. Building on insights of social psychology, this study examines the influence of interethnic marriage as the ultimate form of positive intergroup contact. In doing so, we combine information of the Demographic and Health Surveys with event data on ethnic conflict. Our analysis shows that areas with higher levels of exogamy significantly experience less ethnic conflict.

TI Democratising sustainability transformations: Assessing the
   transformative potential of democratic practices in environmental
   governance
SO EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
AB Many democracies find it difficult to act swiftly on problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss. This is reflected in long-standing debates in research and policy about whether democratic practices are capable of fostering timely, large-scale transformations towards sustainability. Drawing on an integrative review of scholarly literature from 2011 to early 2021 on sustainability transformations and the democracy-environment nexus, this article synthesises existing research on prospects and pitfalls for democratising sustainability transformations. We advance a new typology for understanding various combinations of democratic/authoritarian practices and of transformations towards/away from sustainability. We then explore the role of democratic practices in accelerating or obstructing five key dimensions of sustainability transformations: institutional, social, economic, technological, and epistemic. Across all dimensions we find substantial evidence that democratic practices can foster transformations towards sustainability, and we conclude by outlining a set of associated policy recommendations.

TI Survive or perish: Organised crime in the port of Montreal and the port
   of New York/New Jersey
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW CRIME AND JUSTICE
AB Ports are spaces in which a certain degree of informal - or strictly illegal - governance might emerge. This can involve different activities, from drug trafficking to corruption and different actors, from port worker to terminal owners. Through the collection of qualitative data, this study aims at exploring if and how organised crime is present in the port of Montreal and in that of New York/New Jersey. The paper will investigate the "institutional narrative" of organised crime in these two ports, by particularly focusing on the survival of a paradigm of 'traditional-ethnic organised crime' which has been (re)producing by several law enforcement agencies. Our empirical findings show that the duplex nature of ports, both gates to the sea as much as spaces of global trade, allows reconstructing different manifestations of organised crime on the waterfront that go far beyond the institutional narratives of traditional-ethnic organised crime.

TI THE LIMITATIONS OF A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO CORRUPTION
SO INTERNATIONAL & COMPARATIVE LAW QUARTERLY
AB International human rights law may serve as a language through which lawyers and others describe the harms resulting from corruption, but this approach has significant limitations as a legal framework. Despite a growing emphasis among scholars and practitioners on a human rights approach to the problem of corruption, this body of law does not provide a strong basis for addressing such conduct. International human rights treaties make no mention of corruption, and human rights treaty bodies have not brought conceptual clarity to the question of how corruption violates or undermines human rights. Given that human rights law binds States alone, it is also ill-suited to a phenomenon that typically occurs at the intersection of the public and private sectors. Even as a language for describing how corruption harms social and economic rights, human rights law has its limitations, some of which come into relief when compared with the field of development economics.

TI Who Wins, Who Loses, Who Negotiates Peace in Civil Wars: Does Regime
   Type Matter?
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB Previous research has shown that the outcome of a civil war is related to conflict duration: military victory by either the government or the rebels occurs early if it occurs at all, and the longer a civil war lasts, the more likely it is to end in a negotiated settlement. The models of civil war duration and outcome that have produced these findings are built on characteristics of the civil war and less on attributes of the state itself, other than where the state lies on the Polity autocracy-democracy scale. We propose that how civil wars end varies not only between democracies and authoritarian regimes but among the different authoritarian regime types identified by Geddes, Wright, and Franz. The distinguishing attributes of these regime types-democracy, one-party, personalist, military, monarchical-should lead to different likelihood in defeating a rebel movement, being defeated by a rebel movement, and negotiating a peace agreement with a rebel movement. Results from a series of competing-risk models using the Uppsala-Peace Research Institute Oslo Armed Conflict Dataset demonstrate support for our claim that how civil wars end is partly a function of the characteristics of the regime.

SO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE
AB Costs associated with recognizing an internal armed challenger as a legitimate bargaining partner deter governments from initiating peace talks. Yet peaceful termination of conflict requires formal negotiations between the belligerents. This article presents evidence that democratic reforms provide a window of opportunity for peace talks. Democratic reforms represent an opportunity to break away from the past policies of the state and render the conflict as an artifact of the preceding authoritarian institutions. The article contributes to the research field by enhancing our ability to predict negotiations. It also highlights that democratic reforms can be undertaken during an ongoing civil conflict.

TI Corporate Environmental Governance Strategies Under the Dual Supervision

SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB External regulatory and normative pressures from both the Chinese central environmental protection inspection (CEPI) program and public participation can act together to influence corporate environmental governance behavior. This research uses the multiperiod Difference-In-Differences method to test the compound impact of CEPI and public participation on corporate environmental governance strategies and investigate the underlying influence mechanisms. The results show that CEPI and public participation have a positive compound effect on the corporate "source-control" strategy. A reasonable reduction in pollution charges and increased environmental subsidies are essential to stimulate the green innovation potential of heavily polluting firms. Our research helps clarify the game relationship between the central and the local governments and analyzes how the relationship between the government, the public, and corporates affects environmental governance, thereby advancing principal-agent theory and expanding the current research on institutional pressures and corporate environmental governance.

TI How and When Amnesty during Conflict Affects Conflict Termination
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB In the difficult process of ending civil wars, granting amnesty during conflict is seen as a useful option, with an underpinning assumption that trading justice for peace is effective. However, is the case? This article tries to bring some clarity to when and how amnesty given during conflict has an impact. Amnesty should have different effects on diverse conflict endings: negotiated settlement, rebel victory, government victory, or conflict reduction. The article also disaggregates amnesties to test direct impacts as an incentive or through reducing the commitment problem, and indirect effects that give military advantage to the government. Using a cross-national data set of amnesties in dyadic conflicts from 1975 to 2011, the research finds that amnesty's strongest effect is, surprisingly, not as an incentive but rather to reduce commitment problems. It can lead to negotiated settlements but also to government military advantage. The results have implications for negotiations and conflict resolution.

TI Impacts on the Urban Environment: Land Cover Change Trajectories and
   Landscape Fragmentation in Post-War Western Area, Sierra Leone
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB An influential underlying driver of human-induced landscape change is civil war and other forms of conflict that cause human displacement. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) increase environmental pressures at their destination locations while reducing them at their origins. This increased pressure presents an environment for increased land cover change (LCC) rates and landscape fragmentation. To test whether this hypothesis is correct, this research sought to understand LCC dynamics in the Western Area of Sierra Leone from 1976 to 2011, a period including pre-conflict, conflict, and post-conflict eras, using Landsat and SPOT satellite imagery. A trajectory analysis of classified images compared LCC trajectories before and during the war (1976-2000) with after the war (2003-2011). Over the 35-year period, the built-up land class rapidly increased, in parallel with an increase in urban and peri-urban agriculture. During the war, urban and peri-urban agriculture became a major livelihood activity for displaced rural residents to make the region food self-sufficient, especially when the war destabilised food production activities. The reluctance of IDPs to return to their rural homes after the war caused an increased demand for land driven by housing needs. Meanwhile, protected forest and other forest declined. A significant finding to emerge from this research is that landscape fragmentation increased in conjunction with declining forest cover while built-up areas aggregated. This has important implications for the region's flora, fauna, and human populations given that other research has shown that landscape fragmentation affects the landscape's ability to provide important ecosystem services.

TI Searching for the Institutional Arrangements Towards a New Global
   Environmental Governance
SO LETRAS VERDES
AB Over recent decades the planet's ecosystems have been subjected to severe damage, as a result of their unprecedented exploitation, despite the institutional arrangements generated since the recognition of these environmental problems by the international community. This article examines some theoretical approaches to global governance, looking for answers regarding the interactive processes, institutions and sociopolitical actors immersed in the building of a new world governance. By means of a qualitative methodology, this work analyses the main weaknesses of the current institutional frameworks and the international sectorial organizations on the matters of environment, climate change and sustainable development. It is concluded that a root cause of the problem is the absence of authentic global governance systems to tackle the socioeco-logical crisis, as the actual institutional frameworks consist of a chaotic conglomerate of formal and informal instruments, which lack the effective social and institutional articulation mechanisms needed by the complex, dynamic and interactive nature of the contemporary environmental quandary. The architecture of the new governance systems could be supported upon the multilevel, transversal and transnational integration of the institutional frameworks, as a basis for the reconfiguration of actors, processes and structures of the global environmental governance in the twenty-first century.

AB This article uses two unique panel data sets to study the causal effect that armed conflict has over firm exit in Colombia. Using a fixed-effect estimation methodology at the plant level and controlling for the possible endogeneity of armed conflict through the use of instrumental variables, we find that a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the number of guerrilla and paramilitary attacks in a municipality increases the probability of plant exit in 5.5 percentage points or .28 SD. This effect is stronger for younger manufacturing plants, with a smaller number of workers and low levels of capital.

   International Law: The Least Protection for the Most Vulnerable
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFUGEE LAW
AB The article examines the international legal position of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the wake of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of western Sudan. The innocent civilians of Darfur have become the primary target of an armed conflict in Sudan since 1983. The terrorised survivors fled their homes in search of safety, causing massive forced internal population displacement. The number of IDPs in the world has steadily been increasing, and has now outstripped the number of refugees. Yet there is no specific international legal and institutional apparatus for IDPs. This article highlights and addresses the problems of their legal identity, rights, humanitarian assistance, and protection in international law. It traces the development of international legal and institutional frameworks for IDPs and their current state of coverage and protection. It offers suggestions to overcome the inadequate legal coverage and uncertain protection. The marginalised plight of IDPs needs to be addressed in a holistic manner as an integral part of the international protection of human rights and the enforcement of humanitarian law.

TI Government Intervention, Perceived Benefit, and Bribery of Firms in
   Transitional China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This article examines whether (1) government intervention causes bribery (or corruption) as rent-seeking theory suggested; (2) a firm's perceived benefit partially mediates the relationship between government intervention and its bribing behavior, as rational choice/behavior theory suggested; and (3) other firms' bribing behavior moderates the relationship between government intervention and a firm's perceived benefit. Our study shows that government intervention causes bribery/corruption indeed, but it exerts its effect on bribery/corruption through the firm's perceived benefit. In other words, a firm's perceived benefit fully mediates the relationship between government intervention and its bribing behavior. We also find that other firms' bribery positively moderates the relationship between government intervention and a given firm's bribery. This study partly proves that firms are rational actors. Potential benefit encourages them to practice bribery. Besides, this research also supports the rent-seeking view of bribery/corruption, which argues that government intervention is a source of bribery/corruption. However, we have also identified that only those government interventions that will create "rent" can cause bribery/corruption.

TI Scaling down or scaling up? Local actor decisions and the feasibility of
   decentralized environmental governance: a case of Paramo wetlands in
   Southern Ecuador
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB In Latin America and the Global South, policy-makers are adopting community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) principles for local governments. The idealized emphasis on local' collaborative approaches is known to neglect human geographic contexts and issues of capacity, power, and human drivers of change at larger scales. However, critiques lack empirical evidence of policy implementation decisions. How do local government and community actors choose to use decentralized environmental governance policies in relation to a threatened cultural and natural landscape across their jurisdictions? This question is explored in an ethnographic case of a high Andean wetland region in southern Ecuador by focusing on the context and micro-politics of two seemingly contradictory local government decisions: proposals to nationalize a local community protected area and to work with other local governments to construct a road across the wetlands that could threaten protected area status. When different sectors are devolved to different local actors without strong sub-state institutions for conflict management, decentralization may create incentives for conflict rather than conservation. Governance design depends on understanding how and why diverse local actors engage in boundary-spanning regional strategies, calling for additional contributions from political geographers.

The focus rests on the South Korean government's Green Growth (GG) strategy and the efforts to export this strategy as a role model to emerging economies worldwide through the establishment of the Global Green Growth Institute. We begin with the question why the Korean government is going global with a political program that is heavily disputed at home. We then study the practices by which the state manages to maintain its territoriality under the conditions of global climate change. Lastly, we discuss how multi-scalar practices of environmental governance in the GG strategy are applied by state and non-state actors both in Korea and abroad.

TI Diffusion and innovation for transition: transnational governance in
   China's green bond market development
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
AB Green bonds, an emerging instrument of Chinese environmental economic policy, represents an important step in the country's effort to systemically transform towards 'ecological civilization'. The involvement of transnational actors alongside Chinese state actors make for a compelling case in examining green finance transitions as a phenomenon in global environmental governance. This paper leverages the transition management framework, adapting concepts from transnational governance to develop a 'transnational transition management' lens with which a longitudinal analysis of the policy development cycle is viewed. In combination with social network analysis, we use this framework to explore the evolution of green bonds with diverse forms of secondary evidence. We identify a relationship between the rapid expansion of the Chinese green bond market with coalitions of policy makers and organizations in transnational spaces that catalyze policy diffusion and innovation through consensus building, coordinated experimentation, and distributed monitoring and evaluation; predominantly steered and led by the People's Bank of China. In addition, the political economy of actors in these networks help explain resistance to convergence with global green bond standards. This research suggests an agenda for examining governance as an entry point to analyze and develop strategies for sustainability transitions in finance.

Design/methodology/approach From the perspective of environmental pollution of the air, ocean, forest, water and solid waste, the authors summarize the main important measures and mechanisms of environmental pollution governance in various countries. Findings The results indicate that management research on biodiversity and natural resources must be strengthened, the relationship between economic development and environmental quality management needs to be balanced, the comparative study of domestic and international environmental governance theories and practices should be strengthened, empirical and applied research on environmental governance needs to be focused on, and complete system research on environmental governance and management should be explored. In the future, further strengthening environmental awareness, addressing environmental pollution and managing environmental quality are necessary. Originality/value The environment is the foundation of human survival and development. With the development of economy, contradictions between human and natural environment (e.g. air, ocean, forest and water) have become prominent. Environmental pollution governance cannot only help address existing environmental problems but also solve economic problems of various countries. The prerequisite for sustainable development is to lay a solid foundation for the coordinated development of economic growth and pollution management.

TI Armed Conflict and Food Security in West Africa: Socioeconomic
   Perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose West Africa represents a very good case of a sub-region currently plagued with the problem of food insecurity. Traditional theories have attributed the increasing food insecurity in the region to problems of poor governance, corruption and climate change. In view of the persistent and increasing nature of armed conflict in the sub-region, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of increasing armed conflict on food security in Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized the dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) to investigate the effect of conflict intensity on food security in the 14 member states of the ECOWAS using annualized panel data from 2005 to 2015. Findings The findings reveal that armed conflict is a significant predictor of food security in West Africa. Research limitations/implications The findings of the study bring to fore, the urgent need to rethink global initiative for combating food insecurity. The effort must also identify the causes of armed conflicts and design sound strategies for de-escalating the armed conflicts. Resolving the escalating armed conflict entails developing a conflict resolution framework that is extremely sensitive to the causes of conflict in Africa and adopting localized ex ante institutional diagnostics that would help in understanding the nature of the conflicts. Originality/value Traditional theory perceives climate change, social injustices, property right, food insecurity, religious extremism and bad governance as the predictors of armed conflicts. In this study, the authors departed from the traditional theory by demonstrating that the nature and trend of armed conflict could also pose a serious threat to food security.

TI A taxonomy of green governance: A qualitative and quantitative analysis
   towards sustainable development
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB It is undeniable that our environment is constantly evolving and citizens are facing new issues and challenges related to the environment around the world. Green governance is essential to achieve the goals agreed upon by local and global governments. The concept of green governance makes it possible to understand the integration of the actors of each governance form during decision-making. In this article, we identify the research gap and propose a taxonomy of green governance for sustainable development. We used factor analysis to construct the taxonomy of green governance. We also proposed the critical influencing factors of green governance to build sustainable development. To evaluate the importance of green governance for reducing CO2 emissions and other energy-related consumption, this study conducted two case studies with empirical analysis on the OECD Indian dataset of green growth indicators. The Indian green growth indicators are predicted using a machine learning technique that employs linear digression, support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process. The analysis shows that the taxonomy of green governance-global governance, adaptive governance, climate governance, ecological governance, self-governance, energy governance, and information technology (IT) governance-are related to each other and can work on the same objective by pursuing different activities. In addition, the case study analysis shows that the SVM is the superior technique in terms of predicting the time series data in this study. Based on the analysis, this study suggest that green governance is vital for achieving global sustainable goals for future growth, and policy-makers should keep this in mind when making environmental policy decisions.

AB This paper makes a comparative study of the socio-state capacities developed during the processes of institutionalising protected natural areas (PNA) in Latin America. It sets them within o framework of their interdependence with global governance processes and in relation to the role human rights have played for these purposes. Taking an approach that combines analysis of multilevel collective action with process monitoring, this work traces the trajectories of national and multilateral institutions; analyses the main dynamics that arise in the delimitation of the protection of natural areas in the countries with the greatest biodiversity in the region; and explores the possibilities for new agreements on the global agenda.

TI Researching Governance for Sustainable Development: Some Conceptual
   Clarifications
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
AB This article addresses two problems characterizing policy thinking on environmental change and sustainable development. First, the role of the social sciences in the wider processes of governance is sometimes misrepresented such that the likelihood of achieving consensual decision-making on environmental phenomena is overestimated. Second, the social science discourse on governance is plagued by conceptual confusion. This article seeks to address these problems by outlining an analytical framework for environmental governance research. In the view of this article, scientific knowledge claims are integral parts of governance processes. The article advocates a holistic understanding of governance that includes the production and diffusion of scientific knowledge, political interaction, and decision-making as well as the wider institutional context required for policy implementation and enforcement. The conclusion is that the entire governance process from the translation of scientific knowledge into policy proposals to the implementation will always be laden with politically charged opportunity costs.

TI Cooperative Governance of Inter-provincial air pollution based on a
   Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The global atmospheric environment is becoming more and more seriously polluted. Governments are paying increasing attention to the environmental governance. To support their efforts, a range of financial instruments have been applied. In the present study, we proposed a cooperative inter-provincial air pollution governance model based on Black-Scholes options pricing. First, we developed a Black-Scholes model and used it to deduce the spot price of options. Second, we established an optimal pollutant reduction model for each province in a cooperative game, and used minimum core method to distribute the cooperative income rationally. Finally, we selected the three provinces in China's Fenwei Plain region as examples to illustrate the use of our model in empirical analysis. We found that compared with the traditional non-cooperative territorial management model, the cooperative inter-provincial air pollution governance model based on options pricing decreased the total environmental governance cost in the Fenwei Plain by 4.64% and reduced the environmental governance cost in all three provinces, demonstrating that the cooperative governance model is effective and practical. Based on these results, our model provides an important reference for either national or regional decision- making, and we recommend that Chinese government promote the use of cooperative governance to achieve winewin cooperation among the provinces. By using this model efficiency of the use of environmental resources can be increased and the cost of environmental governance can be reduced. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Criminal and Disciplinary Liability of Physicians for Passive Bribery in
   the Hippocrates Affair
SO REVIJA ZA KRIMINALISTIKO IN KRIMINOLOGIJO
AB Passive bribery under Art. 293 Par. 2 of the official Croatian Criminal Code is a crime of corruption, with which a number of primary care physicians have been charged. They have as responsible persons, received bribes to perform what they are already required to perform during the course of their own business or through their regular activities; in other words, they have received bribes from drug manufacturear to prescribe their own medications. Criminal proceedings, initiated against 364 accused physicians in the Hippocrates Affair are slowly concluding. Completed criminal proceedings, for now, ended with the 283 convictions, which were mainly the result of a settlement between physicians and the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime. However, for the physicians, the case is not closed, because after the final convictions, the Croatian Medical Chamber decided to conduct disciplinary proceedings to determine the unworthiness of convicted doctor. In this paper, the authors examined the responsibility of the physicians accused of bribery based on the Criminal Code, as well as other regulations and acts of the Croatian Medical Chamber which regulate the work of primary care physicians. An analysis of the final judgment in the Hippocrates Affair highlighted the sentences imposed and confiscated material gained through individual criminal offenses committed by physicians. In conclusion, the degree of the endangered property and its consequences are presented. Based on the investigationand analyzes of the situation, we offer de lege ferenda suggestions.

TI Which direction for international environmental law?
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB An enduring challenge to international environmental law is to facilitate the resolution of environmental problems faster than they are being caused. Prominent among potential foundations for substantive international environmental law to this end are (a) neoclassical economic theory (NET) and (b) distributive justice and deliberative democratic theories. Building upon existing critique, this paper makes two broad arguments. The first is that despite the influence of NET's market-based prescriptions, solutions lie not in introducing and extending the privatization and pricing of nature, but instead in subsuming markets within an expanded and enriched public sphere that is characterized inter alia by decentralized, deliberative democratic decision-making. This contention suggests a need to reform substantive environmental law that is informed by NET. The second argument made is that limitations, in particular, of the deliberative democratic approach to environmental problems (e.g., prospects of achieving consensus on natural resource use and the efficacy of any consensus that might be reached) may be overcome by combining it with common key resource control - to put it crudely, by combining meaningful political with economic democracy. This revised foundation would offer a potentially viable foundation for IEL. It also offers guidance for incipient efforts to democratize environmental regulation.

TI Playing the Ethnic Card: Diversion, Transborder Ethnic Ties, and
   Sponsorship of Rebel Movements
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB Under what circumstances do third-party states oppose governments that marginalize their ethnic kin in foreign civil conflicts? We argue that the effect of transborder ethnic ties on third-party support for rebel movements depends upon two factors: (1) a constellation of ethnic power relations in which an ethnicity with access to political power in a potential intervener but is marginalized in a civil conflict state and (2) the political insecurity of leaders in a potential intervener. Said leaders facing a high probability of removal from office are willing to undertake risky foreign policies, including support for rebel movements, hoping that such actions will generate an ethnically tinged rally effect. We draw upon the literature on diversionary theory to develop an empirical expectation. We then assemble a dataset of potential intervener-civil conflict state dyad-years to model this expectation. The political insecurity of leaders is measured with a variety of proxies. Our findings suggest that the well-known diversionary theory can be applied to a novel dependent variable that of third-party state sponsorship of rebel movements.

TI SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND TERRORISM: DOMESTIC
   CONCENTRATION VERSUS TRANSNATIONAL DISPERSION
SO DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
AB Qualitative studies of terrorist movements frequently highlight the importance of diaspora communities as important factors in producing and sustaining terrorist activity in countries. The underlying theoretical argument is that bifurcation of tight-knit minority communities between countries nurtures separatist or irredentist sentiments among affected community members, thus prompting terrorist activity, while minority community members in other countries might mobilize financial and political resources to support terrorist activity among their compatriots. In this study, we empirically test whether transnational dispersion, versus domestic concentration, of minority communities in countries produces higher incidents of terrorism. Conducting a series of negative binomial estimations on a reshaped database of around 170 countries from 1981 to 2006, derived from the Minorities at Risk database and the Global Terrorism Database, we determine that both transnational dispersion of kin minority communities and domestic concentration of minorities within countries increase terrorism and that transnational dispersion is a particularly robust predictor of terrorist attacks.

TI Loss of urban green spaces in Mafikeng, South Africa
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB Urban green spaces provide a number of ecosystem services, including facilitating human physical and mental well-being through recreation. Although pressure from competing land uses is the primary force behind their loss through infill development in many cities globally, this paper highlights how political circumstances of municipal governance and the pursuit of development can precipitate the losses. For a remote town in the developing world context, loss rates were derived using a time series of satellite images from dates in 1992, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2014 and 2016. The images were co-registered in the same map projection, at the 20 m spatial resolution of the older images. The town's public green spaces, which included parks and sports facilities, were located and polygons of their areal extents created through on-screen digitizing. The polygon area values were then calculated. Long-term change in their quality was assessed by patchiness analysis of green-band images. The results show losses in both quantity and quality of the green spaces, which lessened the recreation ecosystem service. Largely due to low prioritization of their maintenance, the municipal authorities permitted the conversion of the green spaces into commercial uses and social amenities such as schools and housing. Policy-based remedial measures are recommended, including increased greenness and incorporating the creation of public green spaces during municipal development planning.

TI Institutional Constraints to Collaborative Ecosystem Management within a
   Wetlands Conservation Partnership
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION
AB Recent decades have seen an evolution in resource management paradigms from the multiple use and sustained yield toward ecosystem management. This ongoing paradigm shift has generated interest in collaborative decision- making as a more promising alternative to conventional top down institutions. While a collaborative approach to ecosystem management promises several benefits, including equity, efficiency, and sustainability, institutional constraints often impede the success of these initiatives. Using the Cache River Joint Venture Partnership in southern Illinois, USA as a case study, this study employed a qualitative research approach to understand how various institutional attributes influence prospects for conflict and cooperation in collaborative decision- making processes. We found that stakeholder motivation and capacity for cooperation with other partners in ecosystem management can be enabled or constrained by several institutional factors, including external policy and regulatory mandates, internal administrative and budget structures, institutional cultures, and approaches to science and decision- making criteria. We conclude with a suggestion that stakeholders in collaborative ecosystem management partnerships identify and address constraints for cooperative action during the early stages of the process.

TI Building Relationships Across the Boundaries: The Peacebuilding Role of
   Civil Society in the Korean Peninsula
SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
AB The expectations for the role of civil society are growing due to an abysmal record of high-level political leadership in reaching an agreement and a sustainable peace process. How much impact can civil society have and what roles can it take in the peace process? This case study of South Korean civil society shows how the civil society was able to bridge the horizontal and vertical boundaries of the Korean conflict with the support of a global civil society, and created a hospitable public atmosphere for the peace process in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the space for the civil society to make a contribution in the Korean peace process required the interdependency of the roles of high-level and civil-society leadership in the interplay between the international and domestic political environments. The peacebuilding role of South Korean civil society demonstrates that the horizontal capacity of civil society alone cannot guarantee a breakthrough and sustainability in a peace process, but if it is coordinated with the vertical capacity, civil-society peacebuilding can be a useful platform for sustainable peacebuilding.

TI Evolutionary Logic and Development Foresight of Environmental
   Collaborative Governance Policy in the Yangtze River Delta
SO LAND
AB The experience of environmental governance in the Yangtze River Delta has formed the practical paths of cross-administrative cooperation and eco-civilization adaptation to economic development. As a result of a scientific analysis of policy texts on collaborative environmental governance in this region, this paper explores differences and core concerns, uncovering the development vein and mapping out the internal logic in order to provide a reference example for multi-regional governance. The policy has shifted from decentralization to authority, from universality to precision, from sustainable development to a community of common ecological destiny, from authoritarianism to co-governance, and from institutional norms to propaganda and guidance. Since the beginning of the new century, the internal logic of environmental governance policy in the Yangtze River Delta has been in line with the trend of coordinated development. In the future, efforts should be made to deepen the trinity mechanism of decision making, implementation, and supervision. When making decisions, we should further emphasize the unified standard of centralized environmental management and adhere to precise pollution control. Implementation will gradually establish the three-dimensional coordination mechanism of region, function, and role; supervision will involve the platform "internet + environment", and the assessment will involve "pressure mechanism + environment".

Without the existence of an over-arching institutional framework on which the autonomy of the discipline might be otherwise premised, the article considers the complexity of understanding and applying autonomy within a diverse field of legal rules and institutional settings. The article will suggest, at least in international environmental law, that the notion of autonomy encompasses a wide range of meanings, ranging from the perceived-utopian (the 'fable') right through to the perceived-dystopian (the 'threat'). In fact, the reality of autonomy in international environmental law is perhaps more nuanced and incremental-though not necessarily any the less significant for all that.

TI The Pursuit of Primordial Interest as an Explanatory Factor for the
   Prevalence of Governance Crisis in Nigeria's Fourth Republic
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW
AB The prevalence of governance crisis in Nigeria is obvious. Inadequate structural facilities continue to impede quality of life while public office holders live in opulence. With abundant resources serving the interests of the individual in positions of power, the Nigerian state continuously slides backward in sustainable development. This paper investigated effect of illicit satisfaction of politician's cronies' selfish interests over national interest on governance crisis. The paper contended that politicians cronies in a bid to satisfy their primordial interests unduly revel, worship and perpetually make demands on leaders as soon as they ascends power. This in turn propel political officeholders to abandon provision of public good in a bid to satisfy the quests of their cronies. Since they rely on public treasury to satisfy these needs, political leaders therefore resort to looting to access sufficient fund. The paper argued that proclivity towards satisfying the quests of politicians' cronies at the expense of public goods aggravates governance crisis in Nigeria. Thus, corrupt public office holders continue to enjoy the support and receive accolades from the people who benefitted thereof. The paper further argued that, in spite of efforts of anti-corruption agencies and civil society organizations in the fight against impunity and bad governance in Nigeria, the effective and rapid promotion of good governance demands a multi-faceted approach in its practice as it affects democracy in Nigeria. To this end, the paper suggested additional ways of addressing the problem of primordial interests and governance crises in Nigeria.

TI Meaningful consideration? A review of traditional knowledge in
   environmental decision making
SO ARCTIC
AB In Canada's Northwest Territories, governments, industrial corporations, and other organizations have tried many strategies to promote the meaningful consideration of traditional knowledge in environmental decision making, acknowledging that such consideration can foster more socially egalitarian and environmentally sustainable relationships between human societies and Nature. These initiatives have taken the form of both "top-down" strategies (preparing environmental governance authorities to receive traditional knowledge) and "bottom-up" strategies (fostering the capacity of aboriginal people to bring traditional knowledge to bear in environmental decision making). Unfortunately, most of these strategies have had only marginally beneficial effects, primarily because they failed to overcome certain significant barriers. These include communication barriers, arising from the different languages and styles of expression used by traditional knowledge holders; conceptual barriers, stemming from the organizations' difficulties in comprehending the values, practices, and context underlying traditional knowledge; and political barriers, resulting from an unwillingness to acknowledge traditional-knowledge messages that may conflict with the agendas of government or industry. Still other barriers emanate from the co-opting of traditional knowledge by non-aboriginal researchers and their institutions. These barriers help maintain a power imbalance between the practitioners of science and European-style environmental governance and the aboriginal people and their traditional knowledge. This imbalance fosters the rejection of traditional knowledge or its transformation and assimilation into Euro-Canadian ways of knowing and doing.

TI Does ethnic conflict impede or enable employee innovation behavior? The
   alchemic role of collaborative conflict management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a societal context of ethnic conflict influences employee innovation behavior in the work domain and whether a collaborative conflict management style adopted by supervisors plays a moderating role.
   Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the conflict, organizational behavior and innovation literature, the study examines the main and interaction effects of employee sensitivity to ethnic conflict, organizational frustration and collaborative conflict management style of supervisors on employee engagement with colleagues to innovate products, services and job processes. Hypotheses are tested using hierarchical regression analysis, controlling for ethnic diversity in workgroups.
   Findings - Employee innovation behavior is greatest when employee sensitivity to ethnic conflict is high, organizational frustration is low and when supervisors are perceived to be highly collaborative in managing conflict, regardless of whether the workgroup is ethnically homogenous or diverse.
   Research limitations/implications - The study findings expand our knowledge of the effects of sociopolitical conflict on employee behavior and the role of collaborative conflict management. Future research can address limitations including self-reports, cross-sectional design and single country setting.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study suggest that employee innovation behavior can be enhanced through developing collaborative conflict management skills of those in leadership positions.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to empirically examine the influence of ethnic conflict on employee innovation behavior and is of value to businesses operating in conflict settings.

Stemming from various factors ranging from historical resistance to the Thai government to human rights abuses and socioeconomic marginalization, the shadowy movement has managed to infiltrate and gain sympathy among local communities; however, the majority of the local population remains resistant and resentful toward the perpetrators. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the upsurge and dynamics of the violence in southern Thailand in a two-part process. First, through focusing on the evidence obtained during my three-year stay in the Pattani province, I demonstrate how geopolitical dimensions intensified the separatist sentiments in the region. In the second section, I propose a proactive and preemptive set of resolutions as a roadmap to avoid further conflict and bloodshed.

TI Partnerships for sustainable development as discursive practice: Shifts
   in discourses of environment and democracy
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB Partnerships for sustainable development are the Type II outcomes that emerged out of the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, 2002. These new mechanisms of environmental governance were an intersection point of three significant discourses in global politics: those of participatory democracy, private governance, and sustainable development. By analysing these three discourses around partnerships for sustainable development, this paper aims at revealing the larger frames of reference and the meta-narratives that explain why and how institutions like partnerships for sustainable development have emerged and how they have actualised. Using key concepts from and discourse theoretical approaches of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, the paper focuses on the negotiations of formal international organisations as a practice of discourse institutionalisation. By recognising that the international negotiations can result in these institutions to carry contestations and conflicts, it traces the dilemmas inherent in partnerships, that reflect shifts in the discourses of environment and development.

TI Humanitarian Law at Wits' End: Does the Violence Arising from the "War
   on Drugs" in Mexico Meet the International Criminal Court's
   Non-International Armed Conflict Threshold?
SO YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW
SE Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law
AB The determination of whether there is an actual non-international armed conflict (NIAC) in the context of the violence in Mexico among the drug cartels themselves and with Mexican governmental authorities is controversial. This paper reopens the debate as to whether the violence meets the Rome Statute's NIAC threshold when assessed against the International Criminal Court (ICC) tripartite criteria of duration, organisation and intensity. It concludes that the violence generally regarded prima facie meets these criteria and that the ICC's war crimes provisions would provide an opportunity for accountability for acts of criminality expressly proscribed by Article 8 of the Statute in relation to war crimes, but not expressly criminalised by Article 7 on crimes against humanity.

TI Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool: More Liberty, Less Terror?
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Is foreign aid effective in reducing terrorism? The existing evidence is mostly negative. We argue that this pessimistic outlook on the efficacy of aid as a counterterrorism tool is partly a function of focusing on only one type of aid: economic aid. Governance and civil society aid can dampen the participation in and support for terrorism by altering the political conditions of a country. We expect countries that receive high levels of governance and civil society aid to experience fewer domestic terrorist incidents than countries that receive little or none. Using a sample of aid eligible countries for the period from 1997 to 2010, we find that governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict. Our findings provide support for the continued use of democracy aid as a counterterrorism tool.

TI Terrorism, organised crime and the biopolitics of violence
SO CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM
AB Despite the lack of consensus on a broadly accepted definition of terrorism, a vast majority of scholars agree that terrorist violence is intrinsically political in contrast to organised crime, which is viewed as mainly profit-driven. This article critically examines this widely accepted distinction and contends that it rests on a narrow definition of the "political", which circumscribes political violence to organisations seeking to overthrow the government, change the political system or alter the boundaries of a state. Drawing on a Foucauldian biopolitical understanding of the political, we argue that the pursuit of economic goals for criminal organisations cannot be disentangled from practices of governmentality which, through the production of disciplinary and regulatory norms, contribute to the construction of distinctive subjectivities and political orders. In order to advance this argument, we focus on the case of the Neapolitan Camorra as a biopolitical actor and contend that its use of violence aimed at the creation of "docile bodies" able and willing to sustain its system and reproduce its order not only challenges the distinction between "political" terrorism and "profit-driven" organised crime, but also has implications for the study of terrorism. In particular, the analysis carried out in this article suggests the need to investigate biopolitical practices beyond a narrow focus on the state by exploring the largely neglected biopolitics of violence of non-state armed groups and examining whether this focus may open new paths for the transformation of conflicts marked by terrorist violence.

AB The development of maritime law and policy is one of the most important tasks for nation States. The implications of globalisation and the importance of the rule of law, the protection of maritime rights and interests and the marine environment should be realised through effective, reasonable and equitable legal systems, within which both public and private law can be utilised to deal with the wide range of marine governance challenges. In October 2013, Shandong University School of Law organised with the support of Zhongcheng Renhe Law Firm the "2013 International Conference on Marine Environmental Governance" to bring together academics, policy makers and maritime law practitioners to examine developments and dispute resolution mechanisms in this field of research. We provide a brief report of the key issues discussed during the workshop which may assist in developing better understanding of ocean governance approaches in different regions and their application to decision-making processes.

TI A global production network for ecosystem services: The emergent
   governance of landscape restoration in the Brazilian Amazon
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly.

TI Bridging Managers' Place Meanings and Environmental Governance of the

SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB This article bridges managers' place meanings and environmental governance to provide insight on the factors that shape decisions concerning the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park. Drawing on a thematic analysis and open coding of data from 34 semistructured interviews, we investigated the perspectives of managers from three agencies charged with protecting the GBR. We observed that a plurality of place meanings converged on five themes: (i) stewardship of the environment, (ii) utilization and access to natural resources, (iii) individualized experience, (iv) intergenerational connections, and (v) spirituality in place. Results revealed that these themes were complemented by formal and informal policy instruments that comprised our governance framework. Informal policy instruments played a particularly important role in the co-creation of knowledge, facilitated negotiations between managers and their constituencies, and increased public involvement in decision making.

TI How is environmental conflict addressed by SIA?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB The fields of Environmental Conflict Management (ECM), Environmental Conflict Resolution (ECR), and Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment (PCIA) have become well established; however, as yet there has not been much use of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) to manage environmental conflicts. ECM, ECR and PCIA are mainly undertaken when problems are advanced or, more likely, have run their course (post-conflict). This paper examines how conflict is addressed by SIA and whether there is potential to develop it for more proactive assessment of conflicts (pre-conflict or while things develop). SIA has the potential to identify and clarify the cause(s) of environmental and natural resources conflicts, and could possibly enable some avoidance or early mitigation. A promising approach may be for 'conflict-aware' SIA to watch for critical conflict stages or thresholds and to monitor stakeholders. Effective conflict-aware SIA might also significantly contribute to efforts to achieve sustainable development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Political ecology explanations for ineffective environmental governance
   for sustainability in the Amazon: a comparative analysis of cases from
   Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
AB There is an extensive literature on environmental governance, which refers to multi-stakeholder processes to arrive at collective decisions about how natural resources will be managed. Recent work on environmental governance has focused on outcomes in terms of social-environmental sustainability. However, questions remain about the effectiveness of environmental governance in practice for yielding sustainable social or environmental outcomes. In cases where environmental governance processes prove ineffective, political ecology offers analytical approaches involving explanations that can account for unsustainable outcomes. In addition, an emergent literature on environmental governance provides frameworks to evaluate its effectiveness by unpacking it with regard to diverse criteria. These two literatures together permit analysis of how political ecology and other potential explanations can account for ineffective environmental governance in terms of specific unmet criteria. Analysis of ineffective environmental governance is likely to be especially valuable in a comparative perspective, in which multi-case studies can reveal the extent to which political ecology explanations predominate across cases. We focus on the Amazon, a large region with high social and biological diversity and where competing stakeholders engage in conflict over governance of natural resources. We pursue a comparative analysis of five cases where environmental governance has been ineffective in terms of sustainable outcomes. In each case, we identified five key explanations for ineffective environmental governance. We then coded those explanations with regard to whether they invoke issues highlighted by political ecology. We also coded them considering environmental governance evaluation frameworks to identify the unmet criteria for environmental governance to be effective. We then pursued a comparative analysis of similarities and differences across the cases. The findings indicate that political ecology issues are predominant among explanations for ineffective environmental governance across all five cases. The results also reveal which environmental governance evaluation criteria are most often unmet among the cases. The findings highlight the importance of political ecology for understanding ineffective environmental governance, and permit delineation of specific criteria for effective environmental governance that can be the focus of strategies to improve environmental governance for sustainability.

SO IZQUIERDAS
AB The following work investigates the ripe moment of the Colombian armed conflict with the guerrilla of the Revolutionary Armed Forces - People's Army (FARC-EP). A wide academic literature is used, problematizing what is meant by the ripe moment of a conflict, and its importance to internalize a negotiated overcoming of it and an abandonment of violence. The above-mentioned, based on official figures of the Colombian armed conflict, provided for this work by the Observatory of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (ODHDIH) of the Presidency of the Republic, and according to various testimonies collected in in-depth interviews with actors involved in the internal conflict, both of the guerrilla and the Government. With this, it seeks to offer elements from which to understand why the negotiation process started in Havana between 2012 and 2016; a process which, thanks in part to that ripe moment, proved successful. Likewise, this experience is contrasted with that of the previous failed Caguan process, which took place between 1999 and 2002. This, to emphasize the importance of the ripe moment so that an armed conflict can initiate a peace dialogue with the hope of its deactivation.

TI Major Armed Conflicts, Militarization, and Life Chances: A Pooled
   Time-Series Analysis
SO ARMED FORCES & SOCIETY
AB Armed conflict typically worsens civilian life chances. The effects of social militarization (maintenance of armed forces) and economic militarization (military expenditures) on civilian life chances are disputed, and the joint effect of armed conflict and militarization on civilian life chances has not previously been examined. This study examines the joint effects of three types of major armed conflicts and two types of militarization on civilian life chances, using a fixed-effects negative binomial cross-national panel analysis (1985-1998) of data from 175 countries with populations larger than two hundred thousand. General economic development, political regime, and country-specific effects are controlled. Armed conflict and militarization interact in affecting civilian life chances. Armed conflict results in higher levels of civilian mortality; militarization interacts with armed conflict, producing the best civilian life chances at either medium-low or medium-high levels of militarization.

AB Armed conflicts leave populations vulnerable to organ trafficking, a criminal enterprise with little international regulation when viewed separately from human trafficking. The Council of Europe's Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs is the only instrument to contemplate the responsibility of actors involved in organ trafficking, but traffickers may go unpunished due to its limited scope. Yet in armed conflict, international humanitarian law offers additional protection. The rules protecting the living and the dead against ill-treatment provide the basic level of protection necessary to consider the international responsibility of organ trafficking networks and the individual criminal responsibility of their members.

TI Infectious disease and political violence: Evidence from malaria and

SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
AB As an infectious disease, malaria consumes around 250 million yearly clinical cases and with more than half a million annual deaths. It has shown tremendous burden for the economic and social life of many countries around the world, particularly in the tropical and developing nations. The conventional wisdom claims that the prevalence of malaria infection either prolongs or should be positively correlated with outbreaks of civil conflicts. We contend that malaria infection should deter civil conflict occurrences because warming parties should avoid engaging each other in areas with rampant malaria infection. We test the hypothesis with 20 years of geo-referenced panel data of conflict event and malaria risk from Sub-Sahara Africa. Our result renders strong support for our hypothesis that areas with more malaria infection tends to have less civil conflicts.

TI Greasing Dirty Machines: Evidence of Pollution-Driven Bribery in China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Environmental pollution has become a serious challenge in emerging markets. Using a unique survey of privately owned enterprises in China, this paper investigates how polluting firms respond to institutional pressures. We find that polluting firms conform to external pressures by combining relational activities and clean technology investments. However, some polluting firms alleviate regulative pressures by bribing government officials, which represents an unethical relational strategy to manage political relationship. We further analyze the contingency on firm-level political connection and local institutional conditions. Political connection buffers firms from institutional demand and demotivates firms' willingness to respond to institutional pressures; stronger local civic activism and better bureaucratic governance curb the pollution-driven bribery, but they are not strong enough to enhance environmentally friendly practices. Collectively, our study demonstrates how polluting firms navigate institutional pressures in emerging markets, and it particularly highlights the pollution-driven bribery as an obstacle to sustainability.

   2009-2015
SO JOURNAL OF BALKAN AND NEAR EASTERN STUDIES
AB This article examines the 2009-2015 peace process between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). It draws from conflict resolution literature to present the five transformers framework that is used to analyse the main transformations the Kurdish conflict in Turkey has undergone has during the past two decades. The article argues that the peace process was not an outcome of external intervention but was an organic process derived of powerful, postn-nationalist intellectual leadership where strategic calculations about the benefits of peace motivated dialogue. It concludes that the peace process collapsed due to context and structural transformations following war in Syria and Iraq that empowered the Kurdish PKK movement in a sudden, rapid and large fashion. The result was caused strong Turkish fears about implications to status quo. In the end, the parties returned to war in order to gain more control and concessions from future negotiations. Concurring with the authors of the five transformers framework, the personal tranformation of a leader strengthens potential for dialogue when they have a change of heart about how to resolve the conflict.

TI Varying climatic-social-geographical patterns shape the conflict risk at
   regional and global scales
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB Given that armed conflict has been seriously impeding sustainable development, reducing the frequency and intensity of armed conflicts has become an explicit goal and a common theme of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Determining the factors shaping armed conflict risks in different regions could support formulating region-specific strategies to prevent armed conflicts. A machine learning approach was applied to reveal the drivers of, and especially the impact of climatic conditions on, armed conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia and characterizes their changes over time. The analyses show a rising impact of climatic conditions on armed conflict risk over the past decades, although the influences vary regionally. The overall percentage increases in the contribution of climatic conditions to conflict risks over the last 30 years in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are 4.25, 4.76, and 10.65 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, it is found that the Climatic-Social-Geographical ("C-S-G") patterns that characterize armed conflict risks vary across the three studied regions, while each regional pattern remains relatively stable over time. These findings indicate that when devising defenses against conflicts, it is required to adapt to specific situations in each region to more effectively mitigate the risk of armed conflict and pursue Sustainability Development Goals.

TI Do Major-Power Interventions Encourage the Onset of Civil Conflict? A
   Structural Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB What is the impact of major-power intervention on civil-war onset? A considerable hurdle to answering this question is gauging expectations about future intervention on the eve of conflict. We tackle this challenge by developing a unified theoretical and empirical model of civil-war onset and subsequent intervention. Our model allows for strategic interdependence among interveners, and our empirical strategy enables estimation of intervention expectations from equilibrium behavior. We fit the model to civil war and intervention data from the second half of the twentieth century and find that major-power intervention is primarily characterized by strategic complementarities-for example, cost sharing among allies or competition for control among rivals-rather than free-riding incentives. Through counterfactual experiments, we show that commitments to decreased intervention would raise the risk of civil war worldwide, whereas increased intervention would have little effect. Our results suggest that coordination among major powers is maximally deterring civil conflict.

CY APR 24-28, 2017
CL Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN
AB Conflicts related to the use of marine space may emerge both at the spatial and the decision making level, prior to and/or after the adoption of a marine spatial plan. Marine conflict management is inherent in marine spatial planning (MSP) and should include three stages: a) identification of compatibilities and conflicts, b) avoidance of conflicts, and if required c) resolution of conflicts. Various decision support tools and processes tested so far that aim to address marine conflict management have proved successful in providing identification and visualization of spatial conflicts and compatibilities and their relevant trade-offs and thus in assisting in conflict avoidance efforts. However, in case conflict resolution is required, they fail to provide a final solution (e.g. allocation of space) acceptable by all parties involved. This happens because the (spatial) allocation rules that these processes adopt usually focus only on ensuring efficiency that is not enough to guarantee a (single) mutually acceptable solution. In the present paper, it is suggested that apart from ensuring efficiency, a solution should also ensure fairness, equity, transparency, sustainability and consideration of synergies that may emerge, both at the spatial and at the decision making level. In conclusion, there is no single tool or process that can satisfactory address all conflict management stages, and thus a careful selection and combination of decision support tools and processes is required to facilitate the production of an integrated mutually acceptable marine spatial plan.

TI A critique of the Global Pact for the environment: a stillborn
   initiative or the foundation for Lex Anthropocenae?
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB In May 2018, the process which may ultimately lead to the negotiation of a legally binding Global Pact for the environment formally commenced under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly. Expectations for the Pact are high, evidenced in particular by its multiple and overlapping objectives: to serve as a generic binding instrument of international environmental law (IEL) principles; to integrate, consolidate, unify and ultimately entrench many of the fragmented principles of IEL; and to constitute the first global environmental human rights instrument. In the wake of the impending intergovernmental process, the paper offers a thorough critique of the draft Pact in its present iteration. We do so with the aim of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the present draft Pact by interrogating: (a) its diplomatic and symbolic relevance and possible unique contribution at the policy level to global environmental law and governance, and (b) its potential at the operational level of IEL and global environmental governance, focusing on the extent to which the draft Pact accommodates both existing and more recent rules and principles for environmental protection. As the Pact's primary ambition is to become a universally binding global treaty, it would be churlish not to recognise its potential for innovation, as well as the considerable opportunity that the negotiation of the Pact will have to generate broad-sweeping and positive impacts. However, our central thesis is that only if the Global Pact were to incorporate ambitious normative provisions to strengthen those public and private global governance efforts that aim to halt the deterioration of Earth system integrity, as well as to maintain and improve integrity, will it be able to offer a firm foundation of the type of Anthropocene Law, termed here as the Lex Anthropocenae, required to confront head-on the deep socio-ecological crisis of the Anthropocene.

TI Economic Liberalization via IMF Structural Adjustment: Sowing the Seeds
   of Civil War?
SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB Previous studies that have explored the effects of economic liberalization on civil war have employed aggregate measures of openness and have failed to account for potential endogeneity bias. In this research note, we suggest two improvements to the study of the relationship between liberalization and civil war. First, emphasizing that it is processes that systematically create new economic winners and losers rather than particular levels of economic openness that have the potential to generate conflict, we consider the effects of one oft-used means of liberalizing economies: the adoption by countries of International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment programs. Second, we use a bivariate probit model to address issues of endogeneity bias. Analyzing all data available for the period between 1970 and 1999, we identify an association between the adoption of IMF programs and the onset of civil war. This finding suggests that IMF programs to promote economic openness unintentionally may be creating an environment conducive to domestic conflict.

TI The Mark of Cain The Crime of Terrorism in Times of Armed Conflict as
   Interpreted by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R v. Mohammed
   Gul
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB On 22 February 2012, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales was called on to interpret the definition of the crime of terrorism as contained in relevant United Kingdom (UK) legislation. When confronted with defence arguments grounded in international law, the Court denied that attacks by non-state armed groups against governmental armed forces in a non-international armed conflict may be exempted from being labelled as terrorist acts. The present article contests this assumption. The Court of Appeal could have interpreted UK legislation in light of the current international legal framework on the definition of the crime of terrorism in times of armed conflict. In particular, some international conventions on terrorism binding on the UK establish that all attacks committed in the context of an armed conflict, including non-international armed conflicts, continue to be governed by international humanitarian law (IHL). IHL provides a definition of the crime of terrorism in times of armed conflict and the Court should have interpreted the UK domestic legislation consistently with this definition. Such an approach is also supported by the idea that non-state actors should be encouraged to apply rules of IHL. Marking them as terrorists, even when they abide by the laws of war, constitutes instead a disincentive to comply with such laws.

TI Governing metropolitan green infrastructure in the United States
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB In this paper we explore whether the enhancement of urban ecosystem services through large-scale, metropolitan tree-planting initiatives is being planned and executed as a component of traditional municipal government or represents new, transdisciplinary strategies in environmental governance. Drawing on qualitative interviews with stakeholders in six major cities (n = 58) we further explore institutionalization of these initiatives and relationships. While much current discourse posits government cannot "go it alone" in providing preventative, "front-end" solutions to complex environmental problems, we found the public sector dominant in the visioning, planning, and management of these green infrastructure initiatives and the role of the private sector to be minimal. We also found that, despite this dominance, the initiatives had limited success in becoming institutionalized. This dichotomy reflects that while discourses labeling the public sector unable to grapple with complex environmental issues and the private sector dominant in environmental governance regimes are premature, institutionalizing the solutions into the machinery of government remains a contested arena.

TI The Changing Factors Affecting Local Environmental Governance in China:
   Evidence from a Study of Prefecture-Level Cities in Guangdong Province
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB This paper aims to examine the changing factors underlying China's environmental governance, by investigating the long-term dynamic impacts of related endogenous and exogenous factors and considering regional differences in these factors. The study estimated environmental regulation intensity and employed the geographical detector technique to analyze its driving factors, based on 21 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong Province, China, from 1990 to 2016. The results showed that environmental regulation intensity has increased in Guangdong Province over the past 27 years. The results also indicated that local environmental governance was affected by global-local interactions and changed based on different regional developmental phases. At first, factors within a region affected local environmental policies more significantly, such as economic development and urbanization. However, in the long run, globalization's impacts have been the most important factors influencing environmental governance. Further analysis showed that environmental regulation intensity in Guangdong Province's different regions was affected by different driven factors. Our analyses contribute to the understanding of China's environmental governance and have policy implications for environmental problem management and China's construction of an ecological civilization.

Drawing on the strategic human resource management (HRM) and peace through commerce literature, we propose that MNEs can mobilize the resources of the firm to reduce migration push factors and promote peace in origin and at-risk countries by adopting peacebuilding as a strategic objective implemented through political CSR and conflict-sensitive HRM within a strategic HRM framework. MNEs that take up this 'grand challenge' are likely to benefit from greater stability and lower risk, the development of new markets, and enhanced organizational reputation, legitimacy, and competitiveness. We develop research propositions on the likelihood of MNE adoption. Policy and management implications are provided.

TI Predicting the decline of ethnic civil war: Was Gurr right and for the
   right reasons?
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Many scholars have detected a decrease of political violence, but the causes of this decline remain unclear. As a contribution to this debate, we revisit the controversy over trends in conflict after the end of the Cold War. While many made ominous predictions of surging ethnic warfare, Gurr presented evidence of a pacifying trend since the mid-1990s and predicted a further decline in ethnic conflict in an article on 'the waning of ethnic war'. Leveraging more recent data on ethnic groups and their participation in ethnic civil wars, this study evaluates if Gurr was right about the decline of ethnic conflict, and if he was right for the right reasons. We assess whether an increase in governments' accommodative policies toward ethnic groups can plausibly account for a decline in ethnic civil war. Our findings lend considerable support to an account of the pacifying trend that stresses the granting of group rights, regional autonomy, and inclusion in power-sharing, as well as democratization and peacekeeping.

In contrast to earlier efforts to map the incidence of conflicts, this dataset is structured in a country-year format that accounts for the temporal dynamics of conflicts. The article reveals that unlike the well-known post-Cold War decline of conflict, there is no contemporaneous decline in the spatial extent of conflict. Furthermore, it is shown that governmental conflicts are more dynamic, both in terms of location and scope, than separatist conflicts.

TI Terrorism before and after 9/11 - a more dangerous world?
SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
AB Was 9/11 the opening salvo in a new age of terrorism? Some argue that this act ushered in a more chaotic world. Others contend an increased focus on terrorism in the past 15 years is the result of conflating terrorist activity with insurgency. We shed light on these claims by analyzing data on domestic and transnational terrorist incidence from 1989 to 2014. The evidence suggests that the years since 9/11 have been different from those preceding them. Once the prevalence of conflicts is accounted for, the post-9/11 era is a significantly less terror prone period than the years before it. A country not suffering civil conflict was upwards of 60 percent more likely to experience terrorism prior to or during the year 2001 than since. However, the opposite trend holds for those countries with a higher proportion of Muslims. Prior to 2001, countries with higher Muslim populations experienced less domestic terrorism. Since 9/11, these countries have experienced significantly more terrorism - both domestic and international - than they had previously.

AB Drug trafficking is frequently argued to be the leading driver of other serious and organised crime, but the interrelationships between such activities remain poorly understood. This paper uses open source law enforcement data to explore interrelationships in Australia. A database was compiled of all reported criminal incidents of high-level drug trafficking between 2011 and 2017 and any concurrent charges for other serious and organised crime (SOC), sourced from official reports and press releases of Australian federal law enforcement and criminal intelligence agencies. Over the seven-years period 24.4% drug trafficking cases involved concurrent SOC charges. Logistic regressions showed characteristics associated with any concurrent SOC charge included the type of drug trafficked, network size, network nationality and OMCG ties. But characteristics differed according to which SOC was cited in connection with the drug trafficking offence e.g. firearms offences versus corruption/fraud. We discuss the implications for research, policy and practice.

SO DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
AB Since 1945, the reason for humanitarian crises and the way in which the world responds to them has dramatically changed every 10 to 15 years or less. Planning, response, and recovery for these tragic events have often been ad hoc, inconsistent, and insufficient, largely because of the complexity of global humanitarian demands and their corresponding response system capabilities. This historical perspective chronicles the transformation of war and armed conflicts from the Cold War to today, emphasizing the impact these events have had on humanitarian professionals and their struggle to adapt to increasing humanitarian, operational, and political challenges. An unprecedented independent United Nations-World Health Organization decision in the Battle for Mosul in Iraq to deploy to combat zones emergency medical teams unprepared in the skills of decades-tested war and armed conflict preparation and response afforded to health care providers and dictated by International Humanitarian Law and Geneva Convention protections has abruptly challenged future decision-making and deployments.

TI Natural Resource Exploitation and Military Spending
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB Why do some states allocate more resources to their military than others? Governments are likely to perceive acute threats to their authority and legitimacy when they face insurgencies in which rebel groups earn significant revenues from the exploitation of natural resources. In response, governments allocate greater amounts to their military budgets. Using data on the exploitation of natural resources by rebel groups and defense spending for states around the world, I find that states where rebel groups profit from natural resources allocate more to their defense budgets than other states. This finding holds even after controlling for the presence of civil conflict itself. The study suggests that rebel exploitation of resources may have an indirect impact on interstate relations: If states indeed face a security dilemma, then increased spending resulting from these internal dynamics is likely to exacerbate the problem.

TI International law protecting the environment during armed conflict: gaps
   and opportunities
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS
AB There are three key deficiencies in the existing body of international humanitarian law (IHL) relating to protection of the environment during armed conflict. First, the definition of impermissible environmental damage is both too restrictive and unclear; second, there are legal uncertainties regarding the protection of elements of the environment as civilian objects; and third, the application of the principle of proportionality where harm to the environment constitutes 'collateral damage' is also problematic. These gaps present specific opportunities for clarifying and developing the existing framework. One approach to addressing some of the inadequacies of IHL could be application of international environmental law during armed conflict. The detailed norms, standards, approaches, and mechanisms found in international environmental law might also help to clarify and extend basic principles of IHL to prevent, address, or assess liability for environmental damage incurred during armed conflict.
