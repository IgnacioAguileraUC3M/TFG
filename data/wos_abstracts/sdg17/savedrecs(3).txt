TI Impact of Carbon Trading System on Green Economic Growth in China
SO LAND
AB Whether China's economy can maintain sustainable growth has been debated both in China and internationally, and the most representative critique has been summarized in the "Krugman Query". Faced with such doubts, how to achieve a "win-win" for economic growth and environmental protection has become one of the central objectives of local government work while striving for the new vision of development. Taking China's carbon trading pilot policy as an example, and based on panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2001 to 2018, this paper uses the Data Envelopment Analysis-Malmquist index model and the Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Difference method to measure the level of green economic growth from two aspects: green development mode and economic growth effect, and further explore the impact of China's carbon trading system on green economic growth. The results show that the implementation of the carbon trading system promoted both the green development level and economic growth of pilot cities, and positively affected green total factor productivity, refuting the "Krugman Query". Finally, the study puts forward a series of recommendations in strengthening environmental regulation, improving green technology innovation, and developing low-carbon industries.

AB Emission trading system plays an increasingly important vole in reducing the pollution for environment. Through mathematical models, an analysis is made on the emissions trading system under an emission reduction framework. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) The impact by environmental taxes on the existing firm's choices of optimal discharging amounts is uncertain, the existing firm's discharging amounts will decrease with the increased prices of emissions permits, and paid initial emissions allowances will reduce the existing firm's profits; (2) Under an intertemporal trading system, the existing firm's holding permits conforms to the principle of profit maximization; (3) Under the intertemporal trading system, the prices for emissions permits for the entrant firms are always on the rise and so are their access costs into the industries, thus frustrating local governments' efforts in attracting investments; and (4) Emissions reduction policy is a good regulatory measure for promoting local economic welfare and realizing sustainable development. Some suggestions are also given for triggering and activating the emissions trading system and formulating supportive policies, such as local governments are obliged to set prices for initial emissions permits to dampen the purchasing impulse of the existing firm and to avoid a thin market of emissions permits.

TI Carbon management accounting and financial performance: Evidence from
   the European Union emission trading system
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Companies are responding to the effects of climate change by reducing CO2 emissions as a way of managing stakeholder interests and complying with legal and regulatory requirements. In Europe, the emissions trading system is consolidated as a limiting market and control scheme to support business climate change management through a collaborative relationship between government and industry. This work focuses on the economic accounting field, analysing carbon management accounting and its impact on financial performance in scenarios attached to that trading system. The methodological approach used is quantitative, empirically testing the hypotheses through a multiple regression analysis with a sample of 350 European companies. The results attest to the importance of carbon management accounting (CMA) control and its effects on financial performance. Compared with European emission trading, the results failed to display significant differences in the relationship studied between those that make up this type of market and those that do not.

TI Role of different stakeholders in trading of reusable/recyclable urban
   solid waste materials: A case study
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB This study aimed to investigate the role of different actors/stakeholders in informal waste recycling/trading system in the Dehradun city, India. An extensive survey on waste recycling/trading system was conducted through a defined methodology and framework of material flow was prepared. Results suggested three operation levels of collection/segregation of recyclable waste articles: (i) household, commercial points and shops, (ii) community waste dumping points and, (iii) municipal waste dump site of the city. The major stakeholders in waste trading system of the city identified as: households, itinerant buyers (Pheriwala), waste pickers, middleman (small dealers), large dealers, and remanufacturing industries. A variety of direct value waste articles (e.g., old news papers and books/magazines, wooden furniture, cardboard/cartons, plastic scrap/polythene bags, iron and non-ferrous metal scrap, glass scrap, rubber, electrical/electronic articles) are being traded in this waste trading network and estimated quality of this material is about 362.4 t per month. The end users in this network are poor house-dwellers and remanufacturing industries. Results suggest that remanufacturing industries are the main buyer of these direct-value materials (paper, iron, rubber, non-ferrous metals, empty liquor/wine bottles etc.). The sharing of benefit/margins by different stockholders in this waste trading system depends upon a variety of political, social and economic factors. The study revealed that informal waste recycling is not only a waste reduction practices but also creates opportunities for urban poors as livelihood earning. Informal waste cycling thus can be promoted as sustainable approach to design a community based solid waste management program for developing cities in low and middle income countries.

TI Carbon emissions trading system and investment efficiency: Evidence from
   China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The economic consequences of environmental regulations remain controversial. This study examines the impact of carbon emissions trading on enterprises' investment efficiency. The results show that carbon emissions trading restrains over-investment and promotes the investment efficiency of enterprises. Additionally, this relationship is more significant in enterprises in higher levels of corporate governance and state-owned enterprises. This study enriches the literature on emissions trading systems from the perspective of micro resource allocation efficiency, enriches the application of the Porter hypothesis, and expands the relevant research on the factors affecting enterprise investment efficiency. Moreover, the results have important practical significance for governments implementing carbon emission reduction policies and enterprises participating in carbon emissions trading.

TI TRADE, DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY - A CRITICAL-ASSESSMENT OF THE
   FREE-TRADE DOGMA
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Mainstream economic theory argues that trade, and especially free trade, is beneficial to everyone involved. This fundamental idea - which has the character of a dogma - still plays an important role in international discussions on trade issues, notably in relation to development and environment. The purpose of this article is to critically assess the ''free trade dogma'' and to investigate the validity of widely used arguments concerning the relations between trade and development and between trade and environment. It is argued that the trading system is not something inherently good, and especially, the developing countries' benefits from trade have been very dubious. Furthermore. the trading system has contributed to environmental problems in several ways, e.g., generating undervaluation of natural resources, stimulating economic growth with environmental deterioration as a consequence, and ''magnifying'' and creating externalities. The critical approach makes a case for reducing trade.

TI The effects of carbon pricing instruments on carbon emission reduction
   in China's refining industry: an evolutionary game between heterogeneous
   refineries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Carbon emissions from the refining industry are receiving increasing national attention. In view of long-term sustainable development, a carbon pricing mechanism oriented to carbon emission reduction needs to be developed. Currently, the two most common carbon pricing instruments are emission trading system and carbon tax. Therefore, it is important to study the carbon emission problems in the refining industry under emission trading system or carbon tax. Based on the current situation of China's refining industry, this paper constructs an evolutionary game model for backward and advanced refineries to explore which instrument is more effectively applied in the refining industry and identify the effective factors that can promote carbon emission reduction in refineries. According to the numerical results, if the heterogeneity of enterprises is small, the government's implementation of an emission trading system is the most effective measure, while carbon tax can only ensure that the equilibrium strategy solution is (1,1) when the tax rate is high. If the heterogeneity is large, the carbon tax policy will not have any effect, indicating that government implementation of an emission trading system is more effective than the carbon tax. In addition, there is a positive relationship between carbon price, carbon tax, and refineries' agreement to carbon emission reduction. Finally, consumers' preference for low-carbon products, R&D investment level, and R&D spillover effect have nothing to do with carbon emission reduction. Only by reducing refinery heterogeneity and improving the R&D efficiency of backward refineries can all enterprises agree to carbon emission reduction.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB There are numerous regional, national, and international efforts to establish mechanisms to curb pollution and emissions. In this paper, we mainly focus on emissions trading systems. Using a static Cournot oligopoly game, we investigate a multi-product multi-pollutant market in which several supply chains compete in a non-cooperative manner in their product markets. This study characterizes conditions under which an efficient solution procedure converges to the unique Nash equilibrium of the oligopoly. Meanwhile, its partners establish a cooperative triopoly game within each supply chain in a nonsuperadditive characteristic function form. Drawing on the cooperative game theory literature, we provide a closed-form solution for a rational distribution of joint rewards between the supply chain's partners.

TI Emissions Trading Systems, Structure Adjustment and Air Pollution
   Reduction: Evidence from Enterprises in China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Using a Chinese-city-piloted emissions trading system (ETS)'s survey data, this study provides nationwide causal estimates of the reduction effects of the implementation of an ETS on air pollution (AP) at the enterprise level. We employ a multiperiod difference-in-differences model to control for potential endogenous problems. The results indicate that the implementation of an ETS significantly reduces the AP of enterprises in pilot areas by 6.96%, and that the effect has a dynamic effect. Heterogeneity analyses show that the emissions reduction effect of an ETS will differ for various enterprises. In terms of region, the implementation of an ETS significantly reduces the AP of eastern, central, and western enterprises by 11.46%, 5.31%, and 12.37%, respectively; in terms of scale, small- and medium-sized enterprises benefit the most (7.69%), followed by large enterprises (1.73%); and in terms of ownership, private enterprises achieve a 7.27% reduction in AP. Additionally, we find that the AP reduction effect is realized by the adjustment of enterprises' energy and production structures rather than by adding air sewage equipment. Overall, since China is the largest AP emitter worldwide, this study will not only have important implications for sustainable development in China but also the world, providing a scientific basis for starting pilot policies in other developing countries.

Our sample of 123 publicly listed participating firms, located in 21 European countries, accounted for 45.43% of emissions in the EU ETS in 2020. Using an event study methodology during the period 2014-2021, we find that positive news was rewarded with increased returns for publication events related to the latter years of the phase (2017-2020) while it had an insignificant impact for earlier year (2013-2016). This indicates that the EU ETS is finally fulfilling its intended function of incentivising participating firms to reduce their emissions. Our study highlights the contextually contingent nature of the relationship between environmental and financial performance.

SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB The multilateral trading system, first established formally in 1947 with the goal of bringing about sustainable peace and greater prosperity through increased cross-border commerce underpinned by globally agreed upon rules, has contributed significantly to economic development and reduced poverty. However, as the global trading system enters the 2020s it cannot rely on past success and must adapt to a rapidly changing world, one that requires both more and different kinds of inclusion in order to address new challenges around inequality and global economic and geopolitical shocks. To address these new challenges the World Trade Organization (WTO) must be updated and reformed by its member governments, who must also recognise that many current global challenges have linkages across trade, tax, environment, and health areas which require increased coordination across global bodies. Further, the challenges of growing domestic inequality in many countries, while a domestic policy concern, will have significant impact on the political will to undertake the necessary updating and reform of the multilateral trading system and the required enhanced coordination with other international bodies and agreements. The recent positive outcomes from the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference in June of 2022 show that global cooperation on trade issues is possible. Building on this success, the WTO can reshape itself to be fairer and more resilient and better able to address current global and domestic challenges.

TI Is the Impact of Trade Policy on Developing and Developed Countries'
   Export Performance Sustainable?
SO ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB This article examines anew the implications of trade policy liberalisation for export performance in both developed and developing countries. The current empirical analysis departs from existing research in that it uses the 'Adstock' approach to investigate whether there exists a cumulative (i.e. sustainable) impact of trade policy liberalisation on countries' export performance. Using a panel dataset comprising 168 countries (both developed and developing) over the period 1998-2014, the analysis provides strong evidence on how the impact of trade policy liberalisation on export performance is sustainable, i.e. whether it is persistent over time. Specifically, more advanced countries appear to benefit from a higher sustainability of the impact of trade policy liberalisation on their export performance than relatively less advanced economies. Moreover, in low-income countries there is no sustainability of this impact. The latter result could be explained by the structural weaknesses that prevent low-income countries from deriving the most benefit from their integration into the global trading system. Overall, the rise in anti-trade sentiment and the subsequent increase in trade protectionist measures are likely to hurt countries' export performance. In addition, it would particularly be desirable that the international community enhance its effort towards helping low-income countries address the structural trade-relating constraints that prevent them from fully benefitting from their integration into the global trading system.

   integrated approach to support policy modeling and implementation
SO ENERGY SYSTEMS-OPTIMIZATION MODELING SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS
AB As the highest carbon emission country in the world, it is particularly important to investigate the implementation effect of China's carbon emission trading (CET) system. Because of the complexity to figure out the counterfactual effect when a single unit is treated, the counterfactual and causal effects of the CET system on the carbon emissions are seldom identified. In order to overcome the weakness that counterfactual effect is difficult to be verified and policy persistence is difficult to be estimated, Synthetic Control Method (SCM) and Regression Discontinuity (RD) are combined to better understand and evaluate the impact of CET system in China. Through the analysis, it is found that CET system is effective in China, but the effect is driven by economic development, energy consumption, FDI and other variables. Because of the differences in economic, geographical, technological and environmental conditions in various areas, each Chinese provincial government should formulate a targeted policy according to local conditions, ensuring an economic and environmentally sustainable growth in the future.

AB China as a country of economic transition and a big country in the world. In the international trade, She passively accepts the price of the carbon transaction under great pressure from European and American developed countries to control greenhouse gas emissions. In November 26, 2009, the Chinese government announced that it was determined that the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 was down by 40%-45% compared to 2005. This is the inevitable requirement to change the way of development of our country and to realize the sustainable development of economy and society. At the same time, this also indicates that China will undertake the obligation of carbon emission reduction in the near future. From the experience of the international development of carbon trading, the establishment of a national carbon trading system is particularly urgent.

AB The difficult social issues faced by non-governmental organizations regarding planning, management, and evolution of the refugee camps led to evaluating alternative development strategies. Indeed, innovative technologies could be promoted for sustainably enhancing local economy. The present model suggests the exploitation of high-albedo materials to generate cool oases in hot climate contexts. The benefits derived by this proposal were investigated by simulating the application of high-albedo devices on shelters in Zaatari, then the avoided carbon emissions were quantified, and several scenarios were discussed. In the framework of the Emissions Trading System, the carbon credits, which can be obtained and sold by contributing to the global warming mitigation process, are estimated to be around 150,000 tons CO2-eq. Considering the market tendencies presented during the COP21 in Paris, the intervention is demonstrated to be sustainable in economic and environmental terms. The payback period is estimated in 3 years in the most reliable scenario. The work presents the main results of a wider research that also included consideration about the urban planning of the camps. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The uncontrolled climate change is one of the most significant threats to the sustainable development of the human societies. Since the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, several models have been proposed to limit the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) by trying to enforce abiding regulations to the participating countries. One of the successful implementations of such models is the Emission Trading System in the European Union, which economically incentivizes the carbon-heavy industries to cut their emissions on a gradual basis. In this paper, we have modeled the involving factors in such a carbon market through the system dynamics methodology, proposing a system of differential equations between the main factors such as the Emission Allowances supply, demand and their price. The coefficients are derived based on a Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) analysis on the historic available data. We analyze the effect of an implementable policy and show that by consistently increasing the coverage of the emissions from industries, the EU commission can reach to its predefined set values of the allowable volumes of emissions by 2050.

AB Climate change has been an increasingly heated issue all over the world because of its severe damage to politics, economy, culture and society. Now it is touching the bottom line of people with threat to sustainable development of society and the survival of human beings. One of the major reasons of climate change is pervasive emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which has forced representatives from different countries to sit together to negotiate for cooperation and solutions. So far the first two most successful achievements have been UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, under which emission reduction ceilings are set for participants and three flexible mechanisms are formed as carbon trading modes. Through several years' efforts, some international carbon trading systems are close to mature, The European Union Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) and Chicago Climate Exchange System (CCX) are two of the most successful ones. Meanwhile, many other emerging Carbon Trading Markets are also developing rapidly, China included. Although China, as a developing country, has not been forced to promise for emission reduction, this situation won't be long and China would be obligated to carbon emission reduction (CER) sooner or later due to its gradually crucial international role. Although the government of China has adopted some measures to contribute to CER, it is still not enough and a lot of mechanisms are waiting for consolidation. As a result, China should learn from other mature systems and mechanisms to motivate their Carbon Emission Reduction Plan. The purpose of this paper is to explore the future development direction of Chinese emission trading market through an outlook of foreign mature mechanisms combined with a deep SWOT analysis of Chinese carbon emission trading market.

SO ANTHROPOLOGY IN ACTION-JOURNAL FOR APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY IN POLICY AND
   PRACTICE
AB All communities of practice must face questions relating to the material economic foundations of future sustainable societies. David Graeber, Karl Polanyi and Karl Marx each have produced typologies of possible types of economy, synthesised as: (1) the principle of individual reciprocity, (2) the market principle of capitalism, and (3) the planning principle of the state. I apply this synthesis to recent proposals for community change advanced by Bill McKibben and David Korten concerning economic scale and the re-localising of production and consumption sundered by globalisation, focused on the local exchange and trading system (LETS). The operationalising of LETS draws upon Adam Smith's view of markets as face-to-face exchanges of goods taking place in small morality-bound communities. Smith, McKibben and Korten conflate two different meanings of the term 'exchange'. To understand the role LETS may play in future sustainable economies in communities of practice demands treatment of this problem.

TI Institutional quality and the effectiveness of aid for trade
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Trade policy barriers and high transaction costs hinder developing countries from taking the full advantages of the global trading system. In order to help developing countries overcome the problem, the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Aid for Trade (AFT) initiatives in its Ministerial Conference held in Hong Kong in 2005. We examine the effects of AFT inflows on bilateral trade costs facing 133 developing countries while accounting for differences in their location on the contours of various measures of institutional quality. Our results from the estimation of a mixed effects (random-intercept and random-coefficient) model indicate that institutional quality significantly affects the extent to which AFT reduces bilateral trade costs. An important policy implication of our findings is that an economically robust and sustainable reduction in bilateral trade costs facing developing countries requires the presence of both promulgated and effectively functioning institutions such as regulatory power and the rule of law.

TI The Diffusion of a Social Movement - Local Exchange Networks in Germany
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE
AB In the late 1980s and early 1990s a new social movement - the local exchange trading systems (LETS) reached Germany. This initially Canadian movement draws attention to societal and economic failures of the monetized economy and attempts to resolve them on a local level. By introducing alternative local currency systems the exchange networks movement tries to promote a sustainable and local economy and aims at improving the living conditions of underprivileged people. Whereas founding activities were initially slow to emerge, a boom occurred in the mid 1990s. Our research describes the patterns of diffusion in German Counties (Landkreise and kreisfreie Stadte). In order to explain the diffusion process, we employ concepts of spatial proximity, the impact of national print media, and general socio-cultural fit. Finally, we analyze the effects of differently defined population densities on founding rates. Using data for the period from 1988 to 2005, we are able to confirm that social contagion and national print media are of considerable importance for the growth of these exchange systems. Furthermore, the roles of socio-cultural factors and of ecological assumptions are supported as well. In East Germany, diffusion takes place very slowly. We discuss this result with respect to the comparative lack of ideological resources.

TI Carbon emission-compliance green location-inventory problem with demand
   and carbon price uncertainties
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
AB In emerging markets, the growth of supply chain networks and logistics industry leads to a significant increase in energy consumption and induces high carbon emissions. To design a sustainable low-carbon supply chain network, we consider a carbon emission-compliance green location-inventory problem. It is characterized by uncertain demand and volatile carbon prices under a multi-year emission regulation, inspired from the carbon-trading scheme in China. A two-stage stochastic mathematical model is built and is solved with a three-phase hierarchical metaheuristic on extensive numerical experiments, which mimic the business context of a supply chain network operated in China. The results show to which extent the carbon-trading emission-compliance scheme, with uncertainties in demand and carbon price, impacts the strategic decisions. Besides, carbon emissions and supply chain profits of the design solutions produced under alternative emission regulations are evaluated and discussed. We also underline the sensitivity of the amount of carbon emissions to the demand uncertainty, and to the level and volatility of the carbon price in the carbon-trading system. These results provide managerial insights for supply chain emitters, and indicate that reasonable and stable carbon prices should be maintained by governments in emerging markets.

TI Impact of carbon trading on agricultural green total factor productivity
   in China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The implementation of the carbon trading system has a great impact on all aspects of the economy and society. Agriculture, which accounts for 34% of global carbon emissions, has also been hit hard as a high carbon emitting industry (Crippa M, 2021). This study uses agricultural green total factor productivity as an important indicator of agricultural green sustainable development, and analyzes the impact of China's carbon trading system on agricultural green total factor productivity, which can provide a reference for other countries that want to improve agricultural sustainable development and implement carbon trading. In this paper, the producer theory is used to build the basic model, and the differences-in-differences (DID) method is used to analyze the provincial data samples in China from 2000 to 2020. It is found that: the implementation of carbon trading pilot policy has a significant promotion effect on agricultural green total factor productivity; and after the implementation of carbon trading policy, with the advancement of time, under the constraint of reducing carbon quota, the pro-motion effect of agricultural green total factor productivity becomes stronger and stronger. Even in the regions without carbon trading pilot program, the policy spillover effect will also be obvious and promote the devel-opment of green total factor productivity of agriculture in this area.

TI Towards sustainable smart cities: A secure and scalable trading system
   for residential homes using blockchain and artificial intelligence
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers' identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.

TI Integrity of the Emerging Global Markets in Greenhouse Gases
SO ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB This article considers the integrity of the emerging emissions allowance markets for greenhouse gases (GHG) under the international emissions trading system created by the Kyoto Protocol and the parallel European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. In particular, we suggest that accepted definitions of emissions baselines, initial allocation of emission credits, verification of "additionality" for GHG reduction beyond what would have occurred without trading, assuring permanence for offset-generating projects, preventing leakage of emissions-generating activities from protected project areas, monitoring, and reporting requirements are problematic. As with previous reforms that also rely on market allocation and expansion of private property rights, GHG trading deflects change in the social relations of production required for more sustainable production while commodifying access to the atmosphere and nature's ability to recycle carbon. Alternatives to this modern-day GHG indulgence system are considered, especially an upstream carbon tax, designed to force change in energy procurement and use. Although we found that most of the conditions required for the efficient operation of the international GHG markets are not being met thus far, further changes in the trading systems are being made.

TI The Trade and Environment Debate on the Regulation of Energy Subsidies
   in the WTO: What Kept Fossil Fuel Subsidies Off the Radar Screen?
SO ENERGY LAW AND ECONOMICS
SE Economic Analysis of Law in European Legal Scholarship
AB The multilateral rules on subsidies have come under intense scrutiny in the wake of rising trade disputes over renewable energy subsidies. The sudden surge in the number of trade disputes and countervailing duty actions against renewable energy support programs has raised concerns that the multilateral subsidy rules may stand in the way of global efforts to promote the development and deployment of renewable energy sources. This paper shares these concerns, but argues that they are only one side of the environmental concerns that arise from the regulation of energy subsidies in the multilateral trading system. Energy subsidies play a dual role from a sustainable energy transition perspective. While renewable energy subsidies tend to help accelerate the transition, fossil fuel subsidies do exactly the opposite. If the multilateral subsidy rules are to help accelerate but not hinder the transition, then they should not only allow governments to subsidise renewables but also discourage them from subsidising fossil fuels. However, the regulation (or lack of) of fossil fuel subsidies in the multilateral trading system receives relatively little attention in the scholarly, policy and judicial debate on trade and environment. This paper attempts to answer why the fossil fuel subsidy issue receives scant scholarly attention.

The mitigating approaches were introduced by the later to curb and minimize amount of GHGs produced by manufacturing, construction and other industrial and heavy engineering based industries. In view of its continuous popularity and adoption by developed countries, this study examines the concept of carbon trading principles and systems and their adoption in the South African construction industry with a view to enhancing sustainability of construction projects geared towards achieving overall sustainable goals. History of emission trading and the concept of GHGs were assessed using previous and relevant literature materials. The study further examines the two emission trading systems, that is, cap and trade as well as baseline and credit, and suggested the earlier for the construction industry based on their benefits and flexibility. Various ways of enforcing the system were also highlighted with emphasis on the willingness and readiness of construction experts, professionals, developers, regulators and other concerned stakeholders in reducing greenhouse gases in the execution, usage and reuse of construction projects.

SO CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH
AB Concrete is today considered to be a crucial material in the ongoing complex transformation of our society in a sustainable direction. One prioritized requirement in this transformation is to reduce the emissions of CO2 that are associated with concrete production and use. One well-known factor which, so far, has not been considered is (re)carbonation of built concrete products over their life cycle. This paper presents research to quantify such uptake in reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It also presents the current status of considering carbonation in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and in International Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). The paper also presents some possibilities for further research on how to improve climate performance by considering carbonation.

AB Fresh water contamination from nitrates is a global crisis. Major contributors are large-scale commercial entities such as farms and factories. Water pollution from direct emissions into the streams is easy to control using technological treatments, but agricultural non-point or diffuse source pollution is difficult to control with those treatments. The organizations which discharge large amounts of nitrates into water systems (e. g., dairies) have economic justification, but their operations affect human health and ecosystem sustainability.
   In this paper, we describe a tradable permit system to control non-point source discharges. The proposed system is quite different to other discharge market proposals, as trading would incur virtually no transaction costs, while correctly accounting for relevant externalities in a highly detailed way, over time and space.
   We use the term "discharge" to refer to the pollutant mass loaded to the aquifer under study. The term "nitrate permit" refers to a permit which allows the owner to discharge nitrates at a given rate. Defining discharge rights and allowing them be traded in a market is an efficient mechanism to reveal the economic values of those rights, and to shift them from low value uses to high value uses. In this paper, we describe how a trading system for nitrate discharge permits is designed and applied at the catchment scale.
   Trading nitrate discharge consents is not as simple as trading other products, because the discharge has spatial and temporal impacts on water quality. The key requirement for a nitrate discharge permit trading system is the ability to estimate these impacts of source loadings on concentrations at water quality control points. Any hydrological software with this capability such as MODFLOW and MT3D can be used to assist nitrate trading.
   We propose an auction mechanism to facilitate trade in non-point source nitrate discharge permits. The land users in the catchment may buy and sell nitrate permits and adjust the type of land use to match the permits held during a year. The regional environmental authority will provide guidance on land use types and permit requirements for those land use types. The regional environmental authority is expected to oversee the trade.
   The proposed trading system is a "smart market." A smart market is a trading system in which computer algorithms determine the prices and allocations that maximise the gains relative to submitted bids (McCabe et al., 1991). In our proposed system, the computer models are a hydrology model to measure the impacts of a given discharge on other points in the catchment, and a linear program (LP) to clear the market and calculate prices. The LP objective coefficients are simply the users' bids. The constraints correspond to minimum quality standards at a set of environmental control points. The LP finds a solution which satisfies the environmental standards at minimum cost to the users.
   The results obtained for a hypothetical catchment model show that water quality constraints restrict the trades, while participant bids mainly influence the location specific prices. Initial allocation of permits matters in distribution of gains.
   Our market considers both present and future effects on environment and other third parties. Thus it is capable of meeting water quality goals in both the short and long term. For the land users, this smart market provides flexibility in land use decisions. The online auction is a convenient way to buy and sell nitrate permits. Conceptually, our market model can be applied to other hydrological pollutants. The proposed smart market has potential to be expanded to include both point and non-point sources, water withdrawals and other factors which effect the concentration. It provides insight into the economic value of pollution reduction at different locations in the catchment.
   Broadly speaking, this smart market is an application of science, economics, and operations research to make everyone better off: the economy, the environment, and society as a whole. It is a modern, sophisticated solution to the conventional problem of environmental pollution.

   ASIAN REGIONALISM IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW"
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB We live in an unprecedented time, which witnesses the rapid transformation of global trade and politics. The neoliberal legal order in the post-war era has recently encountered multifaceted threats. Rising populist nationalism, US-China tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to diverse forms of trade protectionism that has eroded the normative basis of international economic law. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and corresponding economic sanctions have further worsened the instability of the increasingly fragile supply chain and multilateral trading system. Amid these challenges, new Asian regionalism has emerged to shape and construct the new regional economic order. In response to declining hegemonic powers, developing countries in Asia have utilized their collective power to influence global rulemaking. New EU and US Indo-Pacific strategies also recognize the shift of the economic center of gravity to Asia and seek to enhance their involvement in the region. These developments not merely cement the foundation for the multipolar world, but also serve as a catalyst for trade liberalization. The core pillars of new Asian regionalism include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (hereinafter "ASEAN") and the mega-regional trade agreements including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (hereinafter "CPTPP") and the Regional

This study has used existing literature and empirical evidences for analyzing the various issues related to carbon emission trading and solid waste management. A measurement of carbon potential value will be conduct after the municipal solid waste generation data was collected completely, and review the advantage of carbon emission trading from the municipal solid waste management in Malaysia, evaluate the benefit of carbon emission trading as an alternative investment tools and basic framework required to implement them. The article suggests that how an appropriate carbon emission trading system may give more benefit and economical value, and sustainable way of developing the future income generation in environmental sector in Malaysia. In other hand, the changing legislative environment is likely to make current practices highly non-optimal and increase pressures for a change of waste management strategy. The article will become more valuable to all those who have some interests in environmental economic and alternative investment sectors and would like to reduce the global warming and climate change effect and develop the potential value related to carbon emission trading in developing countries.

TI A review on China's pollutant emissions reduction assessment
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB China's initiative on pollutant emissions reduction has attracted global attentions. Sustainability responsibilities endorsed by the Chinese central government indicate that pollutant emissions reduction should be one of the top priorities. This paper aims to review the performance changes during different five-year plan stages for emission control, address the major issues and identify options for the future improvement of China's pollutant emissions reduction. The temporal changing of controlled pollutants during variously five-year planning periods was analyzed firstly, followed by policy recommendations including reforming the environmental data system to improve data reliability, perfecting a market-oriented emission trading system toward reducing social costs, promoting investment, and approaching co-benefits for policy integration.

TI Political conflict and climate policy: the European emissions trading
   system as a Trojan Horse for the low-carbon transition?
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Many economists, businesses, and policymakers view carbon pricing as the single best policy approach to address climate change. Such optimism, however, tends to neglect the political conflicts surrounding climate policy and the necessity to accelerate the ongoing low-carbon energy transition. To unveil these conflicts, we analyze the responses of key actors to public consultations in 2015-16 concerning the EU emissions trading system (ETS) and the EU renewable energy directive. From this, we identify a prominent policy position contending that climate policy should focus on the ETS given its purported efficiency. Some actors who share this position use the ETS as a Trojan Horse - a strategy to divert attention from, and fend off, more ambitious climate action in the form of complementary renewable energy policies. Such political strategies do not just undermine carbon pricing but impede the energy transition at large. However, we also find energy industry incumbents that express support for a much stronger ETS and more effective climate policy. Therefore, it seems that the 'Trojan Horse strategy' may fail and the low-carbon transition might gain increasing support from a broad range of stakeholders. Even so, we argue that any singular climate policy approach risks political capture and that a mix of policies will be necessary to accelerate the ongoing transition. Key Policy Insights Major European industry actors tend to advocate the EU ETS as the primary climate policy instrument. Some European industry actors have used the EU ETS as a Trojan Horse - to fend off strict climate action and to slow down the low-carbon energy transition. Political conflicts surrounding individual climate policies reflect much larger struggles over the direction and pace of the energy transition. Climate policy should not rely too heavily on a single instrument but rather include a mix of measures that promote both low-carbon innovation and the decline of carbon-intensive industries, technologies and practices.

AB The bioeconomy development is an important strategy for increasing sustainability and to achieve European Green deal. Environmental taxes are one of the most important tools for the development of the bioeconomy. The research aim is to compare the role of environmental taxes in countries with different levels of economic development Lithuania and Georgia. The authors explore the following question: whether the policy of environmental taxes can contribute to the development of bioeconomy. Research results show that aims of bioeconomy and environmental taxes are the same and contribute to solving several societal challenges. Environmental taxes in Lithuania are more important and help to development bioeconomy. Lithuania does not yet levy a carbon tax, although it participates in the EU emissions trading system. Having started to implement the Green Deal, Lithuania will have to apply carbon taxes and other environmental taxes. Environmental tax burden in Georgia is very low, but this country has the potential to develop the bioeconomy.

TI Renewing Socialist Development in the Third World
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA
AB Current global economic trends have rekindled interest in development alternatives. Competing socialist and green proposals for these development alternatives raise important questions about crafting institutional vehicles for the simultaneous realisation of popular empowerment, sustainability and poverty alleviation development goals. Much of the debate is about economic scale and the re-localising of production and consumption sundered by globalisation. Yet socialists and greens are fuzzy on principles of economy necessary to achieve their desired goals. To help sort out these issues this article introduces the concept of "socio-material communication" as a way of differentiating among available economic forms. It then offers a design for socialist development that is progressive, sustainable and realisable under current "really existing" conditions. It is concluded that realisation of socialist and green development goals for future human betterment requires the combining of modes of socio-material communication to meet specific development challenges, rather than seeking to impose one mode, such as economic planning or society-wide market operation, indiscriminately.

   AND ART RESEARCH
AB The World public opinion currently discusses uncertainty of the Post - Kyoto negotiations because The Copenhagen Summit held to talk about Post-Kyoto period on December 2009 still has no clear targets about reduction of green gas emissions. Also the future of economic mechanisms of the protocol such as Joint Implementation (JI), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Emission Trading System (ETS) is still unknown situation.
   Kyoto Protocol tries to solve problem of global warming and climate change in the frame of free market mechanism and emphasizes the dimension of the problem in world wide. To sustainable development the protocol suggests the low carbon economy but no worldwide consensus has existed yet. The developing countries have no carbon emission reduction responsibility and this situation lead to objection of some developed countries.
   In this study, the financial sources of Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms are examined and Turkey's situation in the frame of low carbon economy is tried to evaluate. Also the negotiations of Post - Kyoto period researched and commented about the future about Copenhagen Summit's unclear results. As a result, Turkey will have to get responsible about emission reduction like other developing countries and should progress macro policies to adopt the low carbon economy and carbon finance markets can accelerate this process.

TI Dynamic time-frequency connectedness between European emissions trading
   system and sustainability markets
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines the time-frequency spillovers and connectedness network between European ETS and the sustainability markets. Empirically, we rely on the Barunik and Krehlik (2018) Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spillover index to measure the time-varying spillovers, directional spillover, net directional spillover and connectedness network in the short-term and long-term investment horizons. Our findings suggest higher overall interconnectedness between the carbon price returns and sustainability indices, with a total spillover index of 69.75%. More specifically, the magnitude of spillovers is substantially higher in the short term than in the long terms. Moreover, European, France, and Germany sustainability indices exhibit the properties of the largest transmitter of spillover of returns towards the system whereas carbon prices are the lowest contributor to transmitting the spillovers towards the system. In the connectedness network, ETS offers a good investment opportunity with Belgium and Finland sustainability indices due to the lower level of returns connectedness. Finally, ETS provides the portfolio risk reduction in the short-term and long-term investment horizons.

AB While Africa's share of global value-added trade has increased significantly during the past 20 years, connecting African small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to value chains and turning the support for greater intra-African trade into a reality remains challenging. Ensuring that the trade discourse is fully integrated into this development story is critical and countries, especially those that have recently acceded, have to be supported to recognise and take advantage of the global trading system and their WTO membership. To place a spotlight on trade-led growth for SMEs, the International Trade Centre (ITC) launched its SME Competitiveness Outlook in 2015. This flagship publication identified three key determinants of SMEs' ability to integrate into value chains: their ability to compete, connect and change. The ITC's capacity-building interventions, which have a strong focus on African countries, are centred on helping SMEs become more competitive and connect to value chains to drive the continent's sustainable economic development.

TI Municipal Solid Waste Management from the Experience of SAo
   Leopoldo/Brazil and Zurich/Switzerland
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The challenge of developing country governments in municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is complex, often ineffective, and does not meet the required technical sustainability, which involves environmental, social, and financial aspects. The purpose of this research is to analyze two distinct waste management systems, in SAo Leopoldo (Brazil) and in Zurich (Switzerland), to develop a tool called waste stream mapping and also to compare the cities systems. The results show positively that the two municipalities have selective waste collection, however in SAo Leopoldo it was found that less volume was reinserted in the production chain, which considerably increases the volume of waste sent to sanitary landfill, which is the main method of disposal in Brazil. On the other hand, the Zurich management model is more expensive, especially compared to incineration, but its billing and power trading system ends up involving more of the population and paying for the operations, as Zurich generates more income than expenses. This study shows that each stage of waste management has its peculiarity and everything should be planned. The tool adapted from Value Stream Mapping has shown that it is useful to have a broad vision about the municipal solid waste management to be implemented.

TI China's climate change policy: Central-local governmental interaction
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
AB It is indisputable that China has been a major actor in climate change. This raises the question: of which lens is most appropriate to gain an understanding of the recent changes in China's domestic climate change policy? Although there is insufficient attention paid to political science accounts of central-local relations in climate governance, this article aims to contribute to the theoretical research on Chinese climate change policy by developing and applying a theoretical framework. Using this novel theoretical framework based on systems theory, this article analyses the complex allocation of power and incentives between the central and local governments. Methodologically, this research is based on expert interviews with relevant officials, negotiators, scholars, climate nongovernmental organizations, and emitter companies. Our analysis reveals that this evolution has been a nonlinear process that has been substantially influenced by central-local governmental interactions. Specifically, we find two trial-and-error processes in the evolution of China's climate change policy. We conclude with some reflections on the wider implications of this recentralization trend for the long-term sustainability of China's climate change policies.

TI Trading in the era of carbon standards: how can trade, standard setting,

SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB Regulatory cooperation is indispensable for increasing the quality of carbon-related product regulations and standards (CPRS), reducing trade tensions over them, facilitating their alignment, and, eventually, promoting the convergence of different national emission reduction levels towards a universal carbon price. In this article, we explore how trade and trade-related arrangements and institutions can be used to intensify regulatory cooperation on CPRS. We focus on the following questions: when, where, and how does regulatory cooperation on CPRS take place within the international trading system, and what are the ways to strengthen regulatory cooperation on CPRS? While admitting the key role of market forces and the large market factor in the alignment of carbon standards, we argue that this de facto trade-driven alignment requires a steering from state-to-state regulatory cooperation, as well as cooperation of government agencies with private certification schemes in helping producers, especially from developing countries, to comply. Moreover, the potential for more systematic collaboration between the multilateral institutions for climate change and trade should be explored. This could include the establishment of a joint UNFCCC-WTO forum for the exchange of policy-relevant technical and scientific information on key issues surrounding CPRS and consolidation of the relevant database.

TI Reassessing The Trade-Development Nexus In International Economic Law:
   The Paradigm Shift In Asia-Pacific Regionalism
SO NORTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW & BUSINESS
AB This article reassesses the trade-development nexus in international economic law and provides the first examination of the approach to realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through regional integration. It argues that the emerging New Regional Economic Order in the multipolar system will fortify the coalition of developing countries in structuring the legalization of pro-development trade policy. For decades, the misconceived concept of special and differential treatment has ignored the reality of the North-South Grand Bargain and disconnected the World Trade Organization from its development objectives. The development crisis of the Doha Round requires a feasible "Plan B" for the Global South.
   By making interrelated theoretical and substantive claims, this article opens an inquiry into the assertive role of developing countries that prompted the paradigm shift in Asia-Pacific regionalism. The realist and dependency theories are utilized to decipher the geopolitical complexity of the rapidly evolving South-South free trade agreements. As a timely case study, the analysis is based on the creation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community and its implications for economic powers such as the United States and China. It provides an account of the bloc's services trade-oriented development policy under the balance of power strategy. Finally, this article offers regulatory reform proposals on how to integrate development assistance and remove trade barriers. Transnational legal harmonization and human rights protection in line with international labor principles are also indispensable. Such reforms will strengthen the best practices for global regionalism and reinvigorate the trade-development connection in the multilateral trading system.

TI Product rollover strategy and emission reduction with intertemporal
   carbon emission regulation versus consumer supervision
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB As global warming has severely threatened the ecosystem and sustainable development of human beings, carbon trading scheme is introduced to mitigate global warming and consumer environmental awareness (CEA) is gradually enhanced. Government regulation and consumer supervision have required firms to seek efficient strategies of product rollover and emission abatement in order to sustain and increase market share. This paper constructs a two-period analytical model in the context of intertemporal carbon emission regulation to investigate how carbon emission regulations and CEA affect the optimal strategies of product rollover, emission abatement, and social welfare. The results reveal that without consumer supervision, the firm prefers to adopt dual product rollover strategy and the optimal product rollover strategy depends on costs and benefits when product recycling is considered. When CEA is high, welfare and emission abatement regulated by hybrid policy is lower than those regulated by carbon trading scheme. When CEA is low, emission abatement under hybrid policy is superior to those regulated by carbon trading scheme. These findings help provide implications for improving carbon emission management efficiency and prompting sustainable development.

AB After the global financial crisis in 2008, a large number of countries tend to cooperate under the Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) which are represented by the following two modes, the Asia mode and the USA mode. On the one hand, as public goods, RTAs are of great benefit to the membership. On the other hand, the developed countries led by the United States try to wield the RTAs to dominate the reconstruction of the international trade rules. This paper holds that, aiming to construct a new model of major-country relationship featured by "no conflict or confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation", China and the United States should seek for their respective strategic interests in both competition and cooperation. Meanwhile they should stick to the sustainable development of the global economy and trade and reshape the global trading system by deepening the economic cooperation comprehensively. To achieve this goal, China needs to change its role and play a more active part in the reconstrcution of the global trade rules. The major measures to take are planning in advance and pushing forward the domestic reform through setting up the high-level Free Trade Zone (FTZ) network and learning from the related high-standard rules.

TI Sustainability in Material Purchasing: A Multi-Objective Economic Order
   Quantity Model under Carbon Trading
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainability in material purchasing is a growing area of research. Goods purchasing decisions strongly affect transportation path flows, vehicle consolidation, inventory levels, and related obsolescence costs. These choices have an economic impact on the supply chain, in terms of different logistic costs, and an environmental impact, in terms of the carbon emissions produced during goods transportation, storage and final recovery. In this paper, we initially analyze and compare the environmental economic policies established by the International Governments in relation to the carbon trading systems adopted. Then, we overcome a traditional single objective formulation, by developing a bi-objective lot-sizing model in which costs and emissions are kept separated and analyzed by using a Pareto frontier subject to a Cap and Trade mitigation policy. The model is useful in practice to support managers in understanding the Pareto frontier shape linked to a specific purchasing problem, defining the cost-optimal and emission-optimal solutions and identifying a sustainable quantity to purchase when a Cap and Trade mitigation policy is present. We further analyze the model behavior according to variation in market carbon price and we finally analytically demonstrate that today carbon prices are still far too low to motivate managers towards sustainable purchasing choices: there is still a gap of about 79%.

TI A Bibliometric and Literature Review: Alignment of Green Finance and
   Carbon Trading
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The issue of climate change is highly related to carbon emissions. One of the practical efforts to reduce carbon emissions is through carbon trading and offset mechanisms. Implementing carbon trading demands massive funding allocation, which requires sustainable financial policy arrangements from the government and the private sector as an instrument to support nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. However, only a few review articles look into the specific combination of green finance (also known as sustainable financing) and the carbon trading mechanism. In this study, we aim to review research on green finance and its association to the emission reduction and carbon trading. We utilized the VOSviewer framework to perform a bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database, and performed search, identification, and screening processes using selected relevant keywords. We obtained 506 articles from 2014 to 2022 related to sustainable finance and carbon trading aspects. Using rigorous bibliometric approaches, we identified both established and recent research clusters for topological analysis, identification of major research subjects, interdependencies, and trends in collaborative effort. The results indicate that there is ample room for additional research to link carbon trading with green finance initiatives or financing, which can improve the success of carbon trading activities.

TI Power, rules and principles - Which orientation for WTO/GATT law?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Are principles just 'phony concepts' or the very heart of every legal system! The purpose of this article is to inquire to what extent one might describe the WTO system as having triple-jumped from a power-oriented system to a rule-based system and finally to a principle-oriented system. This comparison should not be taken literally. Of course, there have not been 'jumps'. In reality there has been a continuing process in which power, rules, and principles evolved gradually. What are these principles, which also were referred to in the Preamble of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization as basic principles underlying the multilateral trading system! This article searches Appellate Body reports in an effort to identify the use of principles. It first looks at eight 'internal' principles, e.g. trade liberalization, nondiscrimination, sovereignty, and sustainable development, derived from WTO Agreements and focuses then on 'external' principles derived from public international law. Finally, the article discusses the proper role and ranking of principles in the WTO legal system and suggests that these should be balanced by using the principle of proportionality as applied by the International Court of Justice or extensively by the European Court of Justice.

TI Energy Transitions: The Case of Greece with a Special Focus on the Role
   of the EU ETS
SO SCIENCE & SOCIETY
AB Major energy transitions are associated not only with fundamental transformations of the energy sector but also with multidimensional changes in societies. Existing energy systems are heavily implicated in climate change. This paper investigates from an ecosocialist perspective the prevalent high-carbon energy systems in capitalism and their ongoing transformations, with a special focus on Greece as an EU member. Furthermore, it explores whether the EU ETS, in comparison to renewable energy sources (RES) support schemes, created considerable incentives for effective and socially fair transitions to low-carbon systems. Empirical data reveals the enduring high-carbon composition of gross inland energy consumption in Greece while evidence on gross electricity generation by fuel discloses the limited penetration of RES since 1990. The neoliberal design of ETS at the EU level and its poor workings did not induce investments in low carbon technologies. RES support policies have been more significant. However, both have adverse distributional effects, especially on working people since the latter bear the cost of transition for the most part. Effective and fair low- carbon energy transitions need radical social transformation - an ecosocialist path out of capitalism.

TI The Impact of Economic Factors on the Sustainable Development of Energy
   Enterprises: The Case of Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia and Poland
SO ENERGIES
AB The sustainable development of enterprises is based on three pillars: economic, social, and environmental. Sustainable development aims to limit climate change and its negative impact on the natural environment. The main aim of this paper is to assess the impact of selected energy economy factors (government expenditure, environmental taxes, outlays on renewable energy sources, prices of futures contracts for CO2 emissions, outlays on R&D, and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETSEU)) on the sustainable development of the energy sectors in Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, and Poland, from 2008 to 2022. We use the correlation coefficients, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models, and the simultaneous equation. The research results indicate a variation in the direction and strength of the influence of individual economic factors in the studied countries (p < 0.05). The results can support operational and strategic decisions sustaining the sustainable development of enterprises in the analyzed countries. The results indicate the need to reform selected economic factors, with an emphasis on the increased importance of environmental taxes and the reform of the EU ETS, which is a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively.

TI Could Biomass Derived Fuels Bridge the Emissions Gap between High Speed
   Rail and Aviation?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Aviation is a steadily growing sector, which largely contributes to transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. When High Speed Rail (HSR) and aviation are considered as alternative options, HSR proves to be a more environmentally friendly mode of transport. Public available data have been used in order to calculate the emission profiles on two selected intra-European routes (London-Paris and Frankfurt-Amsterdam) by HSR and air. As expected, the air mode results in higher GHG emissions and solutions for mitigating its impact have been analyzed and suggested. Biomass Derived Fuels (BDF) has a limited, up to now, potential, to fill the existing gap in terms of emissions with rail. Moreover, BDF reduction in GHG emissions is accompanied with by an increase in fuel cost. Finally, the cost per tonne of avoided CO2e by using BDF-which values 186 (sic)/t-has been compared with the prices of the European Union (EU) Emission Trading System (ETS) allowances and, from a purely economic perspective, this market based measure still seems a preferable option to curb the GHG emissions of the air mode.

TI Enhancing sustainable development via low carbon energy transition
   approaches
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Major shifts in policies, generation, and consumption patterns of energy must take place in growing countries like Malaysia to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Producing energy alone is no longer the sole purpose of a 98% electrified nation. The goal has now shifted towards the sustainability of cleaner production and energy democracy. Malaysia has announced the aspiration to increase its power generation using renewable energy sources to 20% from the current 2% by 2025. Many catalytic initiatives like the feed-in-tariff (FiT), net-energy-metering (NEM), and the upcoming mini-grid-based energy trading system have managed to create sufficient momentum for renewable energy growth in Malaysia. However, such systems demand certain environmental conditions that may involve river and land use for the technology to function optimally. Thus, understanding the micro to macro needs of multi-stakeholders is critical. Therefore, this study explored the strengths and weaknesses of energy transition methodologies adopted across the globe with local's input. Sub-sequently, the content analysis provided a basis to ascertain an apt method for Malaysia's unique condition. This analysis precedes any single approach to solve the complicated demand on people, planet, and profit, towards meeting SDGs using the multi-criteria analysis. The summary of these energy transition approaches were then applied through a series of interviews to validate a suitable approach. Results from the interviews provide a conceptual milestone for every actor, namely the community, the government represented by the local authority, the state, and the federal government. Therefore, this study suggests further research on innovative interpersonal models as a means toward the macro-outline for a sustainable nation.

TI TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S AND THE CHALLENGES FOR
   THE 1990S - ASIA
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Asian developing countries have had varying experiences in trade and agricultural development in the 1980s, attributable in part to their differing stages of economic development and structural characteristics. Other important influences relate to the external economic environment and the policy choices made by their governments not only during the period but also in the preceding decade.
   The achievements of Asian developing countries under the adverse external conditions of the 1980s are discussed in terms of their macroeconomic and agricultural growth, the commodity structure of agricultural growth, their food production and trade, the expansion and diversification of their agricultural exports, and the policy and nonpolicy factors affecting them. Special attention is given to the role of policy reforms implemented in China and the South Asian countries, following similar policy developments in Northeast and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, toward greater openness in their trade regime and increased private-sector participation in the economy. These reforms have contributed to the observed acceleration in GDP, agricultural, and export growth in the 1980s. However, macroeconomic imbalances have emerged that threaten the sustainability of economic liberalization in those countries.
   The major challenges for the 1990s also differ among the Asian developing countries- In the industrially advanced Northeast economies of Taiwan and South Korea, the primary need is to ease the transition of the remaining rural population as farm incomes continue to fall and workers move to industrial and service activities. This challenge has to be addressed in the context of growing external pressure to further open their domestic market for agricultural imports. Among the Southeast and South Asian countries, there is a need to reduce the existing policy biases against agriculture, particularly against export crop production. Moreover, China and the South Asian countries face the additional challenges of continuing to deregulate their trade regime and internal markets, and of promoting macroeconomic stability.
   Despite the external trend recently toward regionalism, Asian developing countries generally seem committed to an open trading system, on which in fact their past impressive economic performance has been predicated. An important challenge for them in the 1990s is to play an active role in arresting and reversing any protectionist tendencies arising from the formation of regional trading blocs and to support multilateral initiatives such as the Uruguay Round that promote global trade liberalization.

TI Public policy influence on renewable energy investments-A panel data
   study across OECD countries
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper examines the impact of public policy measures on renewable energy (RE) investments in electricity-generating capacity made by institutional investors. Using a novel combination of datasets and a longitudinal research design, we investigate the influence of different policy measures in a sample of OECD countries to suggest an effective policy mix which could tackle failures in the market for clean energy. The results call for technology-specific policies which take into account actual market conditions and technology maturity. To improve the conditions for institutional investments, advisable policy instruments include economic and fiscal incentives such as feed-in tariffs (FIT), especially for less mature technologies. Additionally, market-based instruments such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading systems for mature technologies should be included. These policy measures directly impact the risk and return structure of RE projects. Supplementing these with regulatory measures such as codes and standards (e.g. RPS) and long-term strategic planning could further strengthen the context for RE investments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Community currencies and sustainable development: A systematic review
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Community or complementary currency systems have spread all around the world. Most often, they have been promoted as tools to foster sustainable development albeit they differ in terms of specific objectives. While many case studies have tried to assess the actual impact of these systems, there has been no global analysis summarizing their global impact.
   This paper aims to fill the gap by exploring whether complementary currencies contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development. We use the systematic review methodology on an original dataset gathering most academic publications on the topic in English, French and Spanish. Our main findings suggest that community currencies mostly contribute to social sustainability, and that their economic benefits are somewhat limited due to their small scale and the lack of awareness on their scope. Moreover, very few studies explicitly identify environmental outcomes. Finally, this review reveals some limits regarding current methods for impact assessment in this field. Therefore it encourages more standardization to provide greater accuracy and strengthen the legitimacy of community currencies in order to foster their continued development. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Planning and development of waste-to-hydrogen conversion facilities: A
   parametric analysis
SO ENERGY
AB Production of hydrogen fuel from municipal solid waste can serve as a potential solution to two looming environmental crises: global warming caused by undesirable emissions of greenhouse gases and the everincreasing generation and accumulation of waste in the environment. However, the actual implementation and continuous operation of waste-to-hydrogen conversion facilities require consideration of numerous factors. This study explored the variability of several factors related to waste-to-hydrogen, such as location selection, geographic availability of municipal solid waste, pricing of by-products and waste acceptance, constantly fluctuating energy costs, and carbon credit market values from potential carbon trading systems. Four waste conversion processes previously studied for their triple-bottom-line sustainability have been used as baseline scenarios. The variability of multiple factors and their impacts were assessed via parametric analyses. The effects of these fluctuating factors on the economic and environmental performances of waste-to-hydrogen conversion and the establishment of processing facilities were captured. The results of this study will be beneficial for the industry, private investors, policymakers, and governments while making critical decisions such as location selection, deriving price formulas, and selecting plant capacity.

SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The shipping industry plays a vital role in the world trading system and in maintaining the stability of global supply chains. However, we cannot ignore the damage it brings to the marine environment. With a focus on protecting the marine environment, the sustainable development of shipping companies has also drawn growing attention. This study examines the sustainable shipping management practice system and develops a comprehensive framework to evaluate the significance of influencing elements and prioritizes those factors. This paper adopts a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method. It establishes a total of 11 sub-index systems from three aspects: the external policy pressure of shipping companies, the ecological design of shipping services, and the cross-functional green management within shipping companies. We used the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to analyze data collected from 37 experts in the Chinese shipping industry. The findings show that external policy pressure is the most critical factor influencing sustainable shipping management, followed by eco-design and cross-functional green management. These factors have a big impact and provide management references for shipping company managers and policymakers. They also give the government a company perspective when creating pertinent regulations.

TI The European contribution to global environmental governance
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB The European Union has become an increasingly central player in international environmental politics. Its role, especially as a protagonist to the United States, has been highlighted by the way in which it successfully led the campaign for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The 2005 UK presidency has made climate change one of its twin priorities along with African development, and it is with this in mind that the article discusses the way in which the Union can be considered an international environmental actor in its own right and the various contributions that it makes to global environmental governance. While the EU is well known as a trade actor the complexities of its role as an environmental actor, operating under shared competence between the member states and the Community, are less well understood. Despite the inherent difficulties it has been surprisingly effective, although in areas such as climate change there is a need for strong presidential leadership.
   The EU's most evident field of activity has concerned the many multilateral environmental agreements in which it has come to play a leading role. However, this does not exhaust its contribution to global environmental governance that extends to the dissemination of norms and the incorporation of partners in its accession and neighbourhood policies. Sustainable development is also a key area of internal and external Union endeavour at the WTO and elsewhere, although there are continuing contradictions arising from its agricultural and fisheries policies. Finally, the Union's credibility will rest upon its ability to implement its environmental commitments and this is nowhere more evident than in its new emissions trading system. This is the centrepiece of the EU's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and it is the need to co-ordinate the Union's diplomacy in the extension of the climate change regime, to include the United States and the developing countries, that the UK presidency must address.

TI Is the carbon emissions trading system conducive to the urban green
   technology innovation level? Evidence from China
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Although the academic community has come to accept the Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme (CETS) as a viable market incentive for environmental control, more research is needed to determine if the creation of such a scheme can spur the development of green technologies. Based on the panel data of 274 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2017, this paper uses the propensity score matching-difference in difference (PSM-DID) method to empirically test the green innovation effect of the pilot areas relative to the non-pilot areas before and after the implementation of the policy, uses the mediating effect model and the moderating effect model to test its internal influence mechanism, and further examines the heterogeneity of the policy effects. The findings indicate that pilot CETS deployment can significantly improve green technology innovation (GTI), and the conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. Moreover, the human capital input and the science and technology support have a significant partial mediating effect in the policy effect of CETS on GTI, with the latter contributing greatly. The overall marketization and the financial development positively moderate the impact of CETS on GTI, but government involvement have a reverse moderating effect. In addition, the policy effects is better in cities with higher administrative levels in China and in cities in eastern and western China, while the policy effects in cities with lower administrative levels and in central China is weak or not significant. This study has far-reaching theoretical value and momentous practical significance for China and other developing countries in terms of further deepening and improving the CETS, enhancing GTI, and promoting urban sustainable development.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Trade-Sustainable Development Relationship: The Role of WTO Adjudication
   in Interpreting and Operationalizing Sustainable Development
SO MCGILL INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT LAW AND POLICY
AB As a preambular objective of the international trade regime, sustainable development (SD) has caused identifiable interpretative shifts in some post-WTO decisions. Yet, the shift has been negligible in situations where opposing or contesting rules, norms, or principles from other international regimes challenged the determination of boundaries between trade and trade-related rights. Depicting the incoherency in the judicial decisions, this article argues that trade-SD debate should not just focus on reorienting the adjudicatory task towards attending to SD issues, or borrowing rules, norms, or principles from other regimes, or measuring the level of adjudicators' expertise or the quality of their decisions. Rather, the focus should be on operationalizing SD in trade regulation. In this regard, some relevant questions are whether it is possible to address the complex demands of different member states and their constituents at a judicial site, or whether the adjudicatory body can or should resolve issues that are not necessarily confined to the disputing parties. Considering multiple challenges such as regulatory diversities within and between states, the complexities in addressing the concerns of marginalized participants of the trading system, the absence of public opinion in the judicial proceedings, and the fragmented and weakened governance of social and environmental issues, this article suggests focusing on non-judicial regulatory bodies where the normative potential of SD would produce a much more beneficial and realistic outcome.

TI Road map for sustainable and effective carbon pricing: bridging the gap
   of realities and ambitions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB An increase in policy ambition is needed to close the gaps related to climate change mitigation and those required to meet the targets of Paris Agreement. This article examines the contemporary situation of carbon pricing and suggests how carbon costs would help countries adopt comprehensive climate policies. This paper explores the carbon pricing imitative across different regions and the associated issues and proposes how to format holistic, ambitious approaches for effective implementation of carbon pricing. The carbon taxes and emission trading programs are the primary tools for implementation costs. Carbon taxes, fuel taxes, subsidies for fossil energy, and emission trading systems (ETSs) all contribute to these costs. Different countries have adopted different approaches to adopt and mitigate the adverse effect of carbon emissions, but coordinated and integrated efforts are needed. This paper emphasizes the effective carbon pricing and integrating role of finance departments in climate policy; new synergies can be developed to boost government agencies' ability to implement climate policy. Governments may increase their involvement in carbon pricing beyond direct carbon pricing if they implement efficient carbon pricing. Governments, international organizations, and civil society can all play a role in pushing for effective carbon prices to encourage more ambitious targets. Furthermore, the article stresses the need for open communication and a proper understanding of carbon pricing potential to implement climate policy.

TI Policy coherence and food security: The effects of OECD countries'
   agricultural policies
SO FOOD POLICY
AB There have been important changes to agricultural policies in many OECD countries over the past decade and the international spill-over effects of support and protection have diminished. Now would be a good time to eliminate remaining distortions and put in place more efficient alternatives, including social safety nets and tools to help farmers manage risk. This would lock in the benefits of reform and simultaneously address charges of policy incoherence. In the context of high food prices, new issues have emerged with potential implications for food security. They include export restrictions, the use of biofuel mandates, and the opportunities and threats presented by increased foreign investment in agriculture. On these issues, as well as in terms of conventional support mechanisms, policies in emerging economies (in particular the BRIICS) are increasingly important. A pro-active agenda for policy coherence would involve not just eliminating policies that distort trade, but also enacting positive measures to increase food availability, for example by raising agricultural productivity, using resources sustainably, and eliminating waste and over-consumption. Across countries, there are important gains to be realised from knowledge sharing, and from multilateral action to provide global public goods - not least smoother functioning of the multilateral trading system.

TI Emissions trading, equity, and sustainability: the case for allocating
   entitlements to "individuals-in-community"
SO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Given the likelihood that a post-Kyoto climate change agreement will include provisions for trading greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rights (carbon credits), it is timely and important to look more closely into the merits (or otherwise) of emissions trading systems (ETS), in particular with regard to the issue of the allocation and distribution of entitlements. Thus far, ETSs and other tradable permit systems have allocated entitlements to those historically responsible for emissions or the exploitation of resources (the "grandfathering" principle). There are, however, strong reasons for challenging this practice, and for advocating the allocation of entitlements to all people, in line with the per capita distribution principle. This article argues that GHG emission rights, if they are to be granted, should be distributed on a globally determined equal per capita basis, but collectively managed by community bodies (Community Carbon Trusts) on an "individuals-in-community" basis, instead of being granted or sold by governments to (big) emitters. The approach advocated here is not only ethically more justified, but also strengthens the capacity of communities to deal with climate change and to advance sustainability. It offers an example of how a significant environmental challenge can be met in a more positive way than by the prevailing approaches based on narrow, mainly economic, considerations.

TI Multidimensional assessment of the energy sustainability and carbon
   pricing impacts along the Belt and Road Initiative
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB After its establishment in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has rapidly developed, and it has brought together countries from all over the world. The BRI countries of Eurasia cover nearly 40% of the land surface and, in particular, the energy dimension of BRI is a dynamic and impacting reality: countries connected by the BRI account for 54% of world primary energy supply. In this global framework, it is of uttermost importance to evaluate the behaviour of BRI countries towards energy sustainability issues, by providing an overview of the current situation and assessing its evolution over time. In our analysis, we develop a quantitative framework for sustainability analysis, based on four dimensions: society, economy, energy and environment. The different dimensions are integrated in an overall sustainability index, evaluated through Multi Criteria Decision Analysis and in particular PROMETHEE II. We consider the most impacting (in terms of energy) BRI countries and we implement a comparative analysis of their sustainability providing a ranking and tracking their time evolution. Furthermore, we analyse the current practises of carbon pricing (carbon tax or Emission Trading System) along BRI, when implemented, as these mechanisms can contribute in reducing emissions and improving sustainability, also resulting in a benefit for the economy and society. For this aim, we use the proposed quantitative framework for assessing their effects on BRI sustainability.

TI The Impact of Carbon Emission Trading Policy on Enterprise ESG
   Performance: Evidence from China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The carbon emission trading system profoundly impacts enterprises' sustainable development as an important market incentive environmental regulation tool. Through data collected from Chinese A-share listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2019 and Bloomberg ESG score data, this paper empirically analyses the impact of carbon emission trading policy on enterprise ESG performance and its channel mechanism using the difference-in-difference (DID) method. Results of this study indicate that carbon emission trading policy improves enterprise ESG performance significantly, and robustness tests confirm these findings. Carbon emission trading policy can encourage enterprises to enhance their R&D investments and promote internal controls, ultimately enhancing their ESG performance. Additionally, carbon emission trading policy positively impacts ESG performance in low-carbon enterprises, enterprises where the CEO is separated from the company, enterprises with a high degree of digital transformation, and enterprises receiving high government subsidies. This paper extends our research into the economic implications of carbon emission trading policy, enriching the literature on market-based environmental regulation policies' impact on enterprise ESG performance. With respect to governments' use of carbon emission trading to regulate enterprises environmentally, this paper provides theoretical guidance. It has significant practical implications for improving enterprise ESG performance and sustainability.

TI Carbon emission and cost of blockchain mining in a case of peer-to-peer
   energy trading
SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that has demonstrated great uptake potential in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. The revolution of blockchain brings substantial benefits and innovation to sustainability energy transitions through P2P trading. Blockchain enables energy commodities to be traded. However, perceptions of this technology's impact on the environment and its associated costs have garnered recent adverse publicity. This paper aims to look at the linkages between blockchain technology and energy systems in terms of blockchain power consumption against blockchain advantage over renewable energy transitions via peer-to-peer energy trading. The amount of energy used and carbon released during the blockchain validation process is estimated, and the cost of blockchain is computed to assess its economic benefit in a peer-to-peer energy trading scenario. Real data from running peer-to-peer energy trading systems are used, and numerous insights on the transformation of peer-to-peer energy trading utilising various blockchain scaling methods are provided. Based on the analysis, this paper concludes that the cost of processing trading transactions is lower using blockchain than current coordination costs. Also, blockchain-based energy can be traded more frequently than current regulations allow in order to reap the full benefits of renewable energy. A secure blockchain-enabled P2P trading environment would lead to fair rates for energy providers and prosumers resulting in stimulating the renewable energy market.

TI Opportunities and criticisms of voluntary emission reduction projects
   developed by Public Administrations: Analysis of 143 case studies
   implemented in Italy
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the challenge posed by climate change. Besides the "flexibility mechanisms" defined by the Kyoto Protocol to lower the overall costs of achieving their emissions targets, The Voluntary Green House Gases (GHG) reduction projects can have a lead role in GHG reduction in "non Emissions Trading System ETS sectors". Nowadays, the voluntary market is characterised by critical aspects, such as fragmentation, lack of accounting, monitoring and validation rules that have led to the low spread of voluntary emission reduction projects developed by local authorities in the European Union despite their high potentiality.
   The aim of this paper is to test the applicability of voluntary emission reduction projects in the public sector following a homogeneous and consistent pattern. A research has been performed at local level on 143 voluntary emission reduction projects implemented by Public Administrations in Northern and Central Italy in renewable energy, energy efficiency and transport sectors. The applicable standards and methodologies have been checked and the case studies have been analysed though a three-step process: Preliminary additionality assessment; Projects selection; Validation of the selected project. The assessment shows that energy efficiency projects, once overcoming additionality issues, are the most promising for public entities while renewable energy and transport projects resulted to be mainly affected by double counting problems and lack of reliable methodologies.

TI A bi-level chance-constrained programming method for quantifying the
   effectiveness of water-trading to water-food-ecology nexus in Amu Darya
   River basin of Central Asia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Issues of water scarcity, food crisis, and ecological degradation pose great challenges to the sustainable development of Central Asia. In this study, a bi-level chance-constrained programming (BCCP) method is developed for planning water-food-ecology (WFE) nexus system of the Amu Darya River basin, where the efficiency of water-trading mechanism and the impact of uncertain water-availability are examined. This is the first attempt for planning WFE nexus system by incorporating chance-constrained programming (CCP) within a bi-level optimization framework. BCCP can reflect the risk of violating probabilistic constraint under uncertainty as well as balance the tradeoff between two-level decision makers in the WFE nexus system. Under trading scheme, multiple scenarios in association with different food demand, ecological-water requirement, and water availability are examined. Major findings are: (i) compared with that under non-trading, system benefits would increase [3.9, 20.4]% under trading scenarios, disclosing that water trading is an effective mechanism for the study basin; (ii) when food demand increases 10.5%, water allocated to ecological use would decrease [0.9, 2.7]% under all scenarios, revealing that agriculture can squeeze ecological water; (iii) both system benefit and water allocation would increase with p level, implying there is a tradeoff between system benefit and system-failure risk. These findings can gain insight into the interaction between two-level stakeholders and objectives as well as provide decision support for WFE nexus synergetic management.

TI A secure energy trading system for electric vehicles in smart
   communities using blockchain
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB In this paper a secure energy system is proposed that consists of private and public blockchains for vehicles in sustainable cities and society. The former protects vehicle owners from spatial and temporal information based attacks while the latter provides efficient energy trading in sustainable cities and society. In the proposed system, the dynamic demand based pricing policy for the vehicle owners is proposed using types of vehicles, time of demand and geographical locations. The vehicles' social welfare and utility are maximized using an optimal scheduling method along with the proposed pricing policy. Also, the vehicle owners' privacy is protected by applying differential privacy in the proposed consensus energy management algorithm. The numerical analyses show that 89.23% reduction in energy price is achieved as compared to 83.46%, 73.86% and 53.07% for multi-parameter pricing scheme (MPPS), fixed pricing scheme and time-of-use pricing scheme (ToU), respectively. Applying the proposed scheme, the owners can achieve about 81.46% reduction in their operating cost as compared to 80.48%, 69.75% and 68.29% for MPPS, fixed pricing scheme and ToU, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system is 60.32% secure as compared to 39.67% for MPPS system. Furthermore, using less information loss against considerable background knowledge of an attacker, higher privacy protection of vehicles is attained.

TI Factors influencing the internationalization of small-sized textile
   firms in a Small Island Developing State: A Mauritian study
SO ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL
AB Internationalization offers opportunities to small firms in small island developing states for market growth, sustainability, reduced dependency on local markets, and economies of scale. As small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly playing a significant role in many countries' socioeconomic development, Mauritian-based textile manufacturers are seen as an engine of growth for the Mauritian economy by attracting foreign direct investment, subsequently creating jobs and strengthening the manufacturing base of the economy. In this regard, the contribution of the textile industry in transforming the Mauritian economy from a middle-income economy to a high-income economy is widely acknowledged. However, most of the small- and medium-sized Mauritian textile manufacturing firms are currently not internationalized and face several domestic survival and sustainability challenges resulting from the liberalized trading system adopted by the Mauritian government in 2005. In this article, we investigate firm size-related factors, which influence small textile manufacturers' internationalization intentions. We argue that factors relating to financial and non- financial resources are the main causes discouraging small firms' internationalization. These factors emerged from interviews with ten internationalized medium-sized textile manufacturers in Mauritius that overcame their size-related barriers. We further extended the research by surveying the whole population of internationalized medium-sized textile manufacturers in Mauritius for triangulation purposes.

AB The Internet has introduced trade and commerce to newer possibilities, which is e-commerce. E-commerce has a tremendous impact on processes and practices where the internet is used for advertising any products or services, taking orders through the internet, e-payment systems, and supplying goods to the consumers. Compared to traditional trading systems, deficiencies of businesses, but now e-commerce has become a 'boundary crossing' for the new businesses with several unique models based on technology adoption. The developing countries are adopting e-commerce in businesses, whether the companies are micro-level or medium level. This research aims to examine the key success factors of e -commerce adoption for sustainable SMEs. This research utilizes the TOE framework. The data of research is collected through a questionnaire from Bangladesh's Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. The findings of the research showed that technological, organizational and environmental factors have a profound influence on the adoption of e-commerce. The role of organizational factors is limited. Perceived complexity, compatibility and relative advantage, information intensity, management support have a big impact on Bangladesh's adoption of e -commerce. The government of Bangladesh has initiated several models for adopting e -commerce, though the complexity factor is a barrier in the way of e-commerce adoption. If the compatibility is improved, the sustainability of SMEs in Bangladesh will observe a major change to compete with the international standards of quality. The results of the study have been drawn over Smart PLS version 3.0.

TI System dynamics-based effectiveness and sustainability analysis of
   renewable energy generation policy in China
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB As the Chinese government has promulgated many renewable energy generation policies to reduce carbon emissions and stimulate the renewable energy industry, it is vital to assess the policy effectiveness and extent to which they encourage sustainable renewable energy generation. This paper focused on the most prominent and the best-performing policy mechanisms feed-in tariffs (FIT) and renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and developed a system dynamics model to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the renewable energy generation policies. The model clearly shows the complex causal relationships between the related economic and environmental factors, and the policy scenarios were simulated to indicate the future trends and illustrate the coordination processes between polices and compare the development effects. The results show that current FIT has no obvious impact on the sustainable development of renewable energy industry, while under the integrated scenario, the RPS quota growth rate and fines have a significant positive effect after the construction period. The findings also suggest that a FIT-RPS integrated renewable energy generation policy and a perfect RPS trading system should be prioritized, and the RPS quota ratios and fines should be appropriately increased. As various policies cannot be simultaneously implemented because of financial and resource limitations, the proposed system of dynamics-based analysis approach is useful to analyze policy effectiveness and long-term industry sustainability to ensure the provision of optimized policies. It can also provide guidance for similar problems in different areas as well as decision support for further renewable energy generation policy development.

TI Towards domestic fair trade? Farm labor, food localism, and the 'family
   scale' farm
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB Over the past several decades, consumers in the global North have increasingly looked to fair or alternative trading systems as a means to promote ecologically and socially sustainable agricultural production. While fair trade has historically been limited to international commodity networks, US- based agrofood activists have recently turned their attentions towards building a domestic movement, to bring fair trade principles and standards 'home.' Through an exploration of this growing movement, we consider the potential for third party certification and labeling to incorporate social justice into US- based agricultural production, with a particular focus on the implications for farm workers. We view current efforts to bring the principles of fair trade to the domestic arena as a reflection of several interrelated developments: a growing need on the part of small and mid- sized farmers to garner price premiums due to the erosion of the organic price premium; a recognition of the failure of organic certification to advance a holistic vision of sustainability; and the strategic embrace of voluntary regulatory mechanisms as an alternative to public regulation and collective bargaining. Initial research suggests that this has led to particular framings of the domestic fair trade concept, which may undermine the movement's ability to address the social relations of agro- food production. Specifically, prioritization of the 'family- scale' farm and an undercurrent of food localism may obscure farm workers' role in valorizing the US agricultural landscape.

TI Short Rotation Crops for Environmental Services
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB This report discusses multi-functional biomass production systems, which are located, designed, integrated, and managed so as to provide specific environmental services, in addition to biomass. Besides discussing the general concept and outlining a range of different possible applications, we present in detail specific applications of such systems in Sweden and New Zealand. The overall conclusion is that the environmental benefits from the large-scale establishment of multi-functional biomass production systems could be substantial. Given that suitable mechanisms to put a premium on these environmental services can be identified and implemented, additional revenues can be linked to the biomass production systems. This could enhance the socio-economic attractiveness and significantly improve the market competitiveness of the biomass produced. The development of market-based greenhouse gas mitigation instruments is a clear indication of potential approaches where production needs to be balanced against clearly defined sustainability criteria. Within Australia, for example, the Federal Government is developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme(1) to specifically address issues regarding climate change and to develop efficient systems for energy production and consumption. Thus we are moving to a scenario where short rotation crop (SRC) feedstock material can not only produce a tangible market commodity (i.e. heat, stationary energy, or biofuel) but also, through the development of sustainable systems, address emerging new market opportunities. These new markets address the issue of what are called 'externalities' by quantifying the benefits and costs and making them available to a money-based trading system. The provision of additional environmental services also contributes to local sustainable development, which is in many cases a prerequisite for local support for the production systems.

AB Africa is lagging behind and considered as a lost continent. In the face of globalization, Africa cannot claim for the 21(st) century without integrating its economy into global production and trading system. Africa integration requires a comprehensive approach which ignite rapid structural transformation alleviating poverty and other societal illness, advancement in human development, capacity building and institutional development, reducing social and spatial conflicts and disparities, community empowerment, and the attainment of sustainable societies.
   Energy security can be achieved through a diagonal and convergent approach, which integrate four critical resource factors: water-energy-technology-knowledge. Integration of these critical factors provides the foundation for African development and transformation. Energy security is closely linked with economy, environment, and society. Conversely, energy insecurity produces poverty, deprivation of human development, institutional capacities, and good governance. With the above fundamental tenets, this paper will focus on the followings: 1. overview of the current status of Africa development issues in the light of the energy intensity in terms of production and consumption; 2. examine energy convergence potentials; and 4. emphasize the importance of a comprehensive (diagonal and convergent) approach linking water-energy-water-technology-, which create a framework to balance economy, environment, and society. Such a comprehensive approach is a must to transform Africa towards a knowledge-based continent and integration into the global economy.

TI Can the New Energy Vehicle Pilot Policy Achieve Green Innovation and
   Emission Reduction?-A Difference-in-Differences Analysis on the
   Evaluation of China's New Energy Fiscal Subsidy Policy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Whether the new energy vehicle pilot policy (NEVPP) can achieve green innovation and emission reduction is an important exploration for China to achieve green and sustainable development. This research aims to empirically investigate the impact, impact mechanism, and heterogeneity characteristics of the NEVPP on urban green innovation and emission reduction based on panel data from 281 cities in China from 2004 to 2017, using difference-in-differences (DID) methods and fixed effect (FE) models. The results show that the NEVPP significantly reduces the carbon dioxide emissions of the pilot cities but significantly inhibits the green innovation, and the results are robust to the placebo test, propensity score matching DID (PSM-DID) test, instrumental variable (IV) estimation, emissions trading system (ETS), and Carbon-ETS interference test, and change of the dependent variable. In addition, further studies have shown that the NEVPP's emission reduction effects are mainly achieved by reducing energy consumption, promoting technological innovation, and adjusting industrial structure. Moreover, we found that the NEVPP performed better in the regions where the level of economic development is high, the local government has a good relationship with the market, and the level of non-state economic development is high. In general, our research results show that the NEVPP has achieved innovation and emission reduction policy effects in China, but it is also accompanied by an inhibitory effect on green technological innovation.

TI Measuring resilience in the food-energy-water nexus based on ethical
   values and trade relations
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The challenges of the 21st century require resilient societies and a robust international regulatory framework [1]. The current disruptions to the global framework (most notably by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war on Ukraine) as well as the historic experiences especially of the Great Depression and the Lehman crisis (Annex II) elucidate the importance of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a global regulatory framework. The SDGs provide new targets for resilient development. In this paper we set specific focus especially on SDG 17 "Partnerships for the Goals " and its aim of a free multilateral trading system (Annex I, SDG 17.10-17.12) for sustainable development [2]. Against this background the German Resilience Index was developed as a new measure for defining the resilience of the German society based on the SDGs including the explicit consideration of trade dynamics. The German Resilience Index (GRI) enables an analysis of the extent to which Germany has succeeded in building socio-economic-ecological resilience to defy the storms of globalization. The index is based on the German Sustainable Development Goals and the defined targets, considering also ethical values derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities of the InterAction Council and trade relations as corner stones of resilient development. The analysis thus provides a first approach for systematically considering the impact of Germany's intensive participation in globalization and the ethical values of the German Sustainability Strategy and its SDGs. The results are important for the political decision-making process and the political as well as social discourse about the future course of sustainable, and thus resilient, development in Germany.

TI Has China's Carbon Emissions Trading Pilot Policy Improved Agricultural
   Green Total Factor Productivity?
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB The carbon trading system affects all aspects of the economy and society profoundly. Agriculture, as a high-carbon-emitting industry, has been hard-hit. China's agricultural activities will emit about 820 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, accounting for 7% of the country's total carbon emissions. In order to develop a green and low-carbon economy and control greenhouse gas emissions, China officially launched the pilot carbon emissions trading policy in 2013. The effects and mechanism of this on agricultural carbon emissions are still unclear. Herein, this paper uses China's provincial panel data from 2000 to 2019 to measure agricultural green total factor productivity regarding the implementation of China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy in 2013 as a quasinatural experiment, and uses PSM-DID robustness analysis to evaluate the effect of China's carbon emission rights trading pilot policy on agricultural green total factor productivity in pilot areas. The propensity score method is a type of statistical method that uses nonexperimental or observational data for intervention-effect analysis, which reduces the effects of bias and allows for more reasonable comparisons between treatment and control groups. "Difference in difference" is an approach to policy-effect evaluation based on a counterfactual framework to assess the change in the observed factors in both cases of policy occurrence and nonoccurrence. PSM-DID is a combination of PSM and DID using the PSM method to match each treatment group sample to a specific control group sample, which can solve the problem of self-selection bias in the DID method and assess the policy implementation effect more accurately. This study found that China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy has significantly improved China's agricultural green total factor productivity. Further impact mechanism tests show that China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy will improve agricultural green total factor productivity through environmental protection policies and technological innovation. Finally, this paper puts forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions based on the research results.

AB Sustainable agriculture is the major economic sector (i.e. about 30% of Global economy) with the industrial and trading system in the world's economy. It is important to understand why the sustainable development is very important to the point of view of improving of human life and reducing the poverty. Additionally, we need to sustain our natural resources to be replenished and continue support our human population growth that is continued to increase in alarming rate rather than development, which is in a slow rate that does not meet the demands.
   This paper is to discuss the importance of global agro-ecosystems, to support humans' needs for feeding and continue their lives in a healthy and sustainable life and to function within the society. In addition, the paper will show the availability of the agriculture natural resources in terms of global ecological biological capacities in hectares and the trends in using these resources in terms of an ecological footprint in hectares. Additionally, we study the term of ecological human imprint in relation to the agro-ecosystem as suggested by Shakir Hanna et al; 2014. Further the paper will address the impacts of agro-ecosystem on global economy and, further discuss the impacts of human technological advances on agro-ecosystems ecologically, economically, and social importance.
   Our results show that the global population will be 10.50 billion people in 2050 (i.e. 1.1% the current population growth). The available global cropped land is 2.36 billion global hectares in 2008. The question is the Earth able to provide food and other agricultural products to support the healthy living of all human beings in year 2050 at the current growth rate? The paper is discussing these concerns. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Forging cleaner production: the importance of academic-practitioner
   links for successful sustainability embedded carbon accounting
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Climate change related risks are likely to be addressed, where not already, by new governmental regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading System, carbon taxes, new building codes and energy efficiency standards. However, a gap exists between contemporary research into and knowledge of sustainability embedded carbon accounting and application of these techniques by practitioners. This research addresses the gap between 'knowledge generation' of sustainability embedded carbon accounting instruments (research) and sustainability embedded carbon accounting 'knowledge application' through use of tools (practice) by examining their relationship, the characteristics of the gap, investigating who can change the current relationship, what changes are feasible in the near and medium terms, and how these changes can best be introduced to forge ahead with cleaner production. Accountants in academe as 'knowledge generators' have been vociferous in their calls for accountants in practice to use their professional strengths as appliers of instruments to manage the impacts of business on the environment and the environment on cleaner production by business. For many, carbon is the face of sustainability and the accounting for carbon a method of participating in the sustainability agenda, yet prior research indicates that accountants in practice have been slow to engage with climate change and carbon issues being forced upon them by the environmental crisis. Empirical evidence from a survey of professional accounting firms in South Australia finds that many accounting tools related to sustainability developed by academics are ignored and need greater promotion, yet the results also suggest that, unexpectedly, practitioners apply some 'knowledge' tools promoted by researchers confirming that a gap between academics and practitioners exists. The paper concludes that increased collaboration between academic accounting and professional practice will be the only way for evolution of the relationship between research and practice of sustainability embedded carbon accounting in order to forge ahead towards cleaner production.

TI Spatiotemporal Pattern Evolution in Global Green Trade Networks:
   Implications for Health Economics
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Big health industry is an industry that provides whole process and all factor products and services for human comprehensive physical and mental health. With the increasingly close relationship between health and environment, green products take into account the characteristics of environmental protection, resource intensification, safety, and health, so that the green product industry for the purpose of health and environmental protection has become an important branch of the big health industry. To give a clear portrayal of changes in the global green product trade system, this study derives relevant trade data from the World Bank and the UN Comtrade and by analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the global green product trade pattern from 2001 to 2018, and it explores the product structure and status changes of countries (regions) in the global trading system for green products. According to the research findings, the closely connected global trade network for green products continues to expand. This is a typical network comprising "smaller worlds"; the focus of green product exports has largely stayed unchanged, while imports are shifting from North America and East Asia towards North America, Europe, and the Middle East; the spatial structure of the network shows a transition away from the original transcontinental "dual arch" pattern with the United States at the core towards a "transcontinental + intracontinental" one characterized by the coexistence of "multiple arches" centering around Europe and Asia; the trade network adopts a "point-to-point" model, with no obvious interdependence and competition between countries (regions); furthermore, geographically proximate and culturally similar countries are prone to have closer trade ties. By clarifying the global trade network of green products industry under the background of big health industry, it will help to deepen the understanding of the relationship between participating countries, promote the long-term and stable development of national health industry trade, provide the public with more safe and harmless products, better meet the global public's health needs, and effectively enhance the sustainability of public health.

TI Information spillovers between carbon emissions trading prices and
   shipping markets: A time-frequency analysis
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Climate change has become mankind's main challenge. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping are not totally irresponsible for this representing, roughly, 3% of the global total; an amount equal to that of Germany's total GHG emissions. The Fourth Greenhouse Gas Study 2020 of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that the share of GHG emissions from shipping will increase further, as international trade recovers and continues to grow, alongside with the economic development of India, China, and Africa. China and the Euro-pean Union have proposed to include shipping in their carbon emissions trading systems (ETS). As a result, the study of the relationship between the carbon finance market and the shipping industry, attempted here for the first time, is both important and timely, both for policymakers and shipowners. We use wavelet analysis and the spillover index methods to explore the dynamic dependence and information spillovers between the carbon finance market and shipping. We discover a long-term dependence and information linkages between the two markets, with the carbon finance market being the dominant one. Major events, such as the 2009 global financial crisis; Brexit in 2016; the 2018 China-US trade frictions; and COVID-19 are shown to strengthen the dependence of carbon finance and shipping. We find that the dependence is strongest between the EU carbon finance market and dry bulk shipping, while the link is weaker in the case of tanker shipping. Nonetheless, carbon finance and tanker shipping showed a relatively stronger dependence when OPEC refused to cut production in 2014, and when the China-US trade disputes led to the collapse of oil prices after 2018. We show that information spillovers between carbon finance and shipping are bidirectional and asymmetric, with the carbon finance market being the principal transmitter of information. Our results and their interpretation provide guidance to governments on whether (and how) to include shipping in emissions trading schemes, supporting at the same time the envi-ronmental sustainability decisions of shipping companies.

TI A systematic review and life cycle assessment of biomass pellets and
   briquettes production in Latin America
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The world market for solid biofuels has increased in the last few years, with special attention to the production of pellets and briquettes in emerging bioeconomies. This study presents a systematic review and exploratory Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biomass briquettes and pellets produced in Latin America, and suggests short-term opportunities and political implications. The review was organized following the scoping methodology en bloc with the Standardized Technique for Assessing and Reporting Reviews of Life Cycle Assessment Data - STARR-LCA, in Scopus, Web of Science and Scielo databases. A final list of 150 publications was selected. The review results showed that most of the publications were from Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Costa Rica, and are mainly focused on exploring the thermo-mechanics properties of pellets and briquettes instead of the environmental impacts. Thus, an exploratory LCA was performed based on the data gathered from literature with a focus on global warming potential, terrestrial acidification potential, freshwater eutrophication potential, cumulative energy demand, land use and water consumption. Global warming results ranged from -68.7 (Chilean pellets) to 103 g CO2-eq (Brazilian charcoal briquettes), and pellet productions showed lower values of impacts (-68.7 to 1.33 g CO2-eq) per functional unit. The best scenario, however, was found for the Brazilian briquettes production contributing with less than 10% of the overall relative impacts for cumulative energy demand (0.340 MJ-eq), terrestrial acidification potential (8.59 mg SO2-eq), freshwater eutrophication potential (0.969 mg PO4-eq), land use (136 cm(2)a crop-eq) and water consumption (108 cm(3)), where urban forest residues were used as biomass. The worst-case scenario was found for the charcoal briquettes in Brazil and pellet productions from palm fruit branches in Colombia. Dedicated systems to the pellets/briquettes production seem to be more environmentally benign options than the multifunctional systems investigated. In terms of political implications, it was verified the great potential from these different types of densified biomass in improving and expanding emission trading systems both inside and outside Latin America.

TI The status quo of the EU transport sector: Cross-country indicator-based
   comparison and policy evaluation
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are declining in all major sectors in the European Union, with the exception of one sector that has seen a significant increase in GHG emissions over the past decade - transport sector. The European transport sector faces a significant challenge in achieving the decarbonization goal set by the European Green Deal. Although the European Commission is planning to introduce a set of EU-level measures, such as the inclusion of road transport in the EU Emissions Trading System, the progress of greening the transport sector has so far largely depended on national policies. To understand whether European countries are committed to rapidly adapt to low-carbon transport systems, it is crucial to evaluate what progress have national policies achieved so far in moving towards a sustainable transport system. This study used a three-level assessment of transport sector sustainability across European countries. First, this study assessed the overall sustainability level of the transport sector in all European Union Member States and the United Kingdom using the composite sustainability index method for cross-country comparison. Countries were compared using 15 transport indicators grouped into four dimensions (mobility, sustainability, innovation, and environment) based on the latest available data from 2017 obtained from Eurostat, European Commission, and Odysee-Mure databases. Second, in order to identify the dynamics of progress, Logistic Mean Division Index (LMDI) decomposition analysis was conducted to assess the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector over ten years, taking into account the five main factors: emission intensity effect, renewable energy (RES) transition effect, energy intensity effect, economic growth effect, and population growth effect. Third, to analyse what has impacted the sustainability of the transport sector in countries, the study highlighted several key policies (directions) for decarbonizing transport from the analysis outlining the good practice policies from the best performing countries. The combined results of the composite sustainability index and decomposition analysis revealed significant differences between Nordic, Western, and Eastern European countries, suggesting that different approaches should be taken in developing effective sustainability policies for transport.

TI Socio-economic impacts and challenges associated with the
   electrification of a remote area in rural Tanzania through a mini-grid
   system
SO ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Electricity is an indispensable building block for sustainable development. As national and international electrification measures in rural areas of Tanzania are progressing slowly, a solar-powered mini-grid system with second-life battery storage was commissioned on an island in Lake Victoria in 2019 to support local development. This article evaluates the socio-economic impacts associated with electrification through this system. On average, 42.31 kWh of electricity could be provided per day. The daily demand of the main infrastructure (hospital and school) was 18.75 kWh on average. The remaining capacity thus offers enough potential to supply private households and possible economic activities. In order to evaluate the impact of electrification, a qualitative survey was conducted on site 12 months after commissioning, with 7% of the people living there being interviewed. Language barriers as well as intercultural hurdles made the survey difficult and required an adaptation of the on-site implementation. The focus of the survey was on the areas of health, education and economics. The study revealed that the availability of electricity has enormous potential to improve people's living conditions. Initial successes could be seen, especially in the areas of health care and the economic sector. So far, electrification has had no influence on the area of education. While the connections for the main infrastructure have been institutionally supported, the system-related electricity price of (sic)1.30/kWh has proven to be a major obstacle for private households. This is far too high for widespread use compared to incomes. The article thus focuses on the observation that full socio-economic development through electrification can only succeed if local people can afford it. Possibilities to solve this problem are analysed. Since the energy is generated on the basis of renewable resources, the analysis focuses on the use of mechanisms of the emissions trading system (ETS). The aim is to generate revenue through the sale of certified emission reductions (CERs) for the saved CO2 emissions and thus reduce the electricity price. A reference scenario of conventional energy production forms the basis for discussion of the effectiveness of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Carbon Initiative for Development (Ci-Dev). In addition, the approach of a monthly free quota of electricity, the free basic electricity initiative (FBE), is included in the evaluation.

TI Regulatory and Policy Analysis of Production, Development and Use of
   Sustainable Aviation Fuels in the United States
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The United States, spurred in part by international developments, is expanding its law and policy to incentivize the use of sustainable aviation fuels. While the U.S. has agreed to participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO's) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), it has only recently adopted federal rules that define greenhouse gas emission reduction standards for certain classes of airplanes (effective January 2021). However, such standards focus on engine efficiency rather than the fuel burned. For sustainable aviation fuels, the U.S. continues to rely on voluntary programs at a federal, state, and regional level. The federal Renewable Fuel Standard program allows producers to opt in. In addition, states have started to allow sustainable aviation fuel producers to "opt in" to their programs; this includes California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Clean Fuels Program, and Washington's newly adopted Clean Fuels Program. Other states are also starting to consider such programs. Elsewhere, states like Hawaii are starting to support SAF production in other ways, including through tax mechanisms. In addition, regional and private efforts to adopt and/or promote sustainable aviation fuels are underway. This piecemeal approach-due in part to the lack of cohesive U.S. federal policy-stands in contrast to the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive and Emissions Trading System, and adoption of policies by European countries. Because of aviation's international nature, tracking what is happening in Europe matters greatly for U.S. carriers. As the U.S. works to meet its international obligations through CORSIA, finding a way forward with sustainable aviation fuel in the United States may depend on a more defined federal policy. Actions taken by both the EU and European countries offers some guidance for actions that could be taken by the U.S. Even in the absence of more defined measures, better tracking of voluntary measures is a critical step.

TI A Win-Win Scheme for Improving the Environmental Sustainability of
   University Commuters' Mobility and Getting Environmental Credits
SO ENERGIES
AB European Union Member States are called upon to meet internationally proposed environmental goals. This study is based, in particular, on the recommendation of the European Union (EU), which encourages Member States to pursue effective policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, including through appropriate changes in the behavioral habits of citizens. In this respect, among the main sectors involved, transport and mobility should certainly be mentioned. National institutions should be adequately involved in order to achieve the objectives set; in this regard, universities must certainly be considered for their educational value. These latter, for instance, could commit to improving the environmental performance of the mobility of their commuter students (to a not insignificant extent), since commuting modes are often the cause of high CO2 emissions; indeed, they still largely involve the use of internal combustion engines based on fossil fuels. In this paper, the effectiveness of a smartphone-app-based method to encourage commuter students to adopt more sustainable transport modes is evaluated. In more detail, starting from a statistical analysis of the status quo of mobility habits of a sample of students at the University of Palermo (Italy), an improvement of current habits toward a more sustainable path is encouraged through a new application (specifically created for this purpose) installed on students' smartphones. Then, the daily and annual distances traveled by commuters with the new mobility modes are calculated, and the resulting savings in energy and CO2 emissions are estimated. Finally, it is proposed that the reduced emissions could be converted into energy-efficiency credits that the University could use to enter the emission trading system (ETS), here contextualized within the Italian "TEE" ("Energy Efficiency Credits") scheme, while the benefits for students participating in the program could consist of reduced fees and free access to university services. The results obtained show the feasibility of the proposal. This approach can be considered a useful model that could be adopted by any other public institutions-not only universities-to facilitate their path toward decarbonization.

TI Mini-Grids for the Base of the Pyramid Market: A Critical Review
SO ENERGIES
AB The lack of access to electricity of more than 1.1 billion people around the world remains a major developmental challenge and Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as well as Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) have set a target of universal electrification by 2030. Various studies have identified mini-grid-based electrification as a possible solution. There is a growing body of literature available now that has explored the feasibility, practical application and policy interventions required to support mini-grids. Through a review of available literature, this paper explores whether mini-grids can be a solution for the base of the pyramid (BoP) market and the challenges faced in deploying mini-grids in such markets. Interventions to support the mini-grid deployment are also discussed. The paper finds that the mini-grids are targeting the BoP market but the business is not attractive in profitability terms and requires financial support. Lack of regulatory clarity and non-coordinated policies affect the financial viability of projects, which requires careful support. Mini-grid electrification has hardly been embedded in rural development agenda and hence they have not contributed significantly to livelihood generation. Careful realignment of policies, regulatory frameworks and support systems can better support mini-grid deployment in developing countries.

TI Public procurement - price-taker or market-shaper?
SO CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
AB Purpose - This paper examines the role of government procurement as a social policy mechanism within a multilateral open trading system. Government regulations globally are being transformed to foster more responsible business conduct in multinational enterprises (MNEs). Yet, concern that sustainability may present a discriminatory barrier to trade has stalled the progress of sustainable public procurement (SPP) at the international level, raising questions regarding the role and scope of the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) to align taxpayer-funded contracts with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals.
   Design/methodology/approach - With a focus on social sustainability, this paper reviews the grey and academic literature to assess the changing landscape of public procurement policy and supply chain legislation in high-income countries.
   Findings - Frontrunner nations are adopting a mandatory approach to sustainable public procurement and due diligence legislation is elevating supply chain risk from reputational damage to legal liability. While technological innovation and the clean, green production of manufactured goods dominates the sustainable public procurement literature, the social aspects of sustainability poverty, inequality and human rights remain underrepresented.
   Research limitations/implications - The scope of this paper is limited to the examination of government procurement covered by the WTO-GPA (2012). Smaller value contracts, under the WTO-GPA thresholds and the category of defence are beyond the scope of the paper.
   Social implications - The paper focusses on the underserved topic of social sustainability in business-to-government (B2G) - business to government - supply chains arguing that for responsible business conduct to become a competitive advantage, it must be more meaningfully rewarded on the demand-side of all taxpayer-funded contracts in organisation for economic co-operation and development countries. The paper introduces the idea of priceless procurement as a mechanism to build system capacity in the evaluation of non-financial sustainability objectives.
   Originality/value - To build the capacity to stimulate competition based on social and environmental policy objectives, the paper introduces the concept of priceless procurement in B2G contracts.

TI Relationship Between Environmental Sustainability and Human Development
   Index: A Case of Selected South Asian Nations
SO VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB All the economists today have established that externalities (free-rider issues) and public goods are the leading causes of market failure, holding the utmost level of relevance of environmental economics. Pollution types can be segregated physically based on the channels (water, air and land) or the sectors responsible for causing it (e.g., industry, electricity generation, transport, agricultural waste disposal, etc.). Thus, sustainability emerges as a key challenge of the twenty-first century for public think tanks and business communities in the form of carbon emissions and global warming. So, in order to understand the role of sustainability in the era of development, the overall broader purpose of the current study is to study the quantitative linkages between human development index (HDI) (a sustainability measure of standard of living, i.e., per capita GDP) and environmental performance index (EPI, measure of environmental health and ecosystem vitality) for the selected South Asian nations (SANs) and comparative analysis of India with the selected developing nations from 2002 to 2016. To test whether the degree of economic expansion and standard of living have a systematic relationship with the level of environmental deterioration (existence of Kuznet curve hypotheses) in a country which poses a future threat to the global warming potential (GWP), the study employs dynamic panel modelling on selected SANs, followed by descriptive graphical synthesis to visualize the association for India in particular. Several other macroeconomic and capital flow variables, such as energy consumption, direct foreign investment and so on, are considered in the extended empirical model development in order to supplement the holistic review of the situation. The findings of the panel analysis discover HDI to be positively associated with EPI, depicting higher human capital accumulation leading to lower environmental damage and better environmental performance. Additionally, the results confirm the deviation from environmental Kuznet curve (EKC) hypotheses to link economic growth positively with climatic worsening (due to recent reversals). The study finds its niche to separate it from various other studies as it includes human capital accumulation in order to find its effect in the long run on sustainability indicator. The overall results suggest crucial policy implications. The combined efforts of government at local and national levels could help in infusing green technology-based infrastructure. Additionally, environment trading system (ETS) could further be promoted in developing nations, particularly in many Western developed nations, in order to have a greener sustainable future.

TI CARBON TRADING UNDER THE EU ETS AND ENERGY PRICES: A CASE OF THE CZECH
   REPUBLIC
SO POLITICKE VEDY
AB Climate change is quite generally perceived as one of greatest threats that our planet together with all human beings will have to face in future. It has been proven that if the Earth's temperature rises by more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is likely to become irreversible and the long-term consequences could be immense (for details see e.g. Stern, 2006). On the other hand, if one takes an early action, climate change might be rather a challenge than a threat. It may be the impulse needed in order to turn the existing economic order on a more sustainable, low-carbon and energy- efficient path. In this respect the European Union introduced the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). It came into operation in January 2005 as the largest multi-country, multi-sector GHG trading system world-wide. Initially it was considered to help the European Union to meet its Kyoto commitment but in the course of time it has developed into a more ambitious system enabling the European Union to tame its emissions for at least the next decade. The system is a kind of cap-and-trade system, i.e. it is based on a given cap on emissions and trade in emission allowances and thus gives value to reducing CO2 emissions. A key achievement is the ability of the system to put a price on carbon. Like any market, the key to pricing is scarcity, and the price depends on both the stringency of a cap (the absolute quantity of allowances available), the demand for allowances and expectations about the future. The most fundamental difference of trading in emissions from any other type of market is that the amount available depends directly on government decisions about allocations; and expectations about the future are largely expectations about future emission targets (Grubb, Neuhoff 2006). The new regulatory scheme is deemed to have serious implications for European business and may transform the way business is done in the power and heat sector, as well as in other relevant industries. That is why the authors decided to try to deal with this issue; however, due to clear limits on the data availability they will centre their attention exclusively on the case of the Czech Republic. The authors consider this paper a theoretic exercise enabling them to explore the possibility to build a simple model, the aim of which is to draw relevant conclusions about the impacts of the introduction of the ETS system in the Czech Republic. The model should actually describe, through calculating the change in the prices of electricity, the impact of the ETS primarily on power sectors and consequently on the other sectors covered in the ETS.

   TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
CT 4th China Roundtable on WTO Accessions and the Multilateral Trading
   System
CY DEC 13-14, 2015

SP World Trade Org
AB Economic transformation is an important pre-requisite for African countries to maximize the benefits of globalization. The development outcomes of the transformation process are conditioned on the one hand by the level of inclusiveness and on the other by the sustainability of the development pathways, among other factors. Building on experiences since the new millennium, in which Africa has witnessed rapid and sustained discourse that accompanied the formulation of the Common African Position on Sustainable Development Goals, African countries have charted a transformation path in which they aspire to play to their comparative advantages.
   The transformation path that is also articulated in Africa's Agenda 2063 is one that rests on structural change in which industrialization plays a greater role. The comparative advantages in support of the envisaged structural transformation include an abundance of natural resources whose value can be enhanced before consumption or trade; a potentially large integrated continental market; a young, healthy and educated population; rapid urbanization complemented with falling costs of transport and communication due to increased public investments in infrastructure; and rapidly falling energy costs, especially in renewables.
   Yet, in spite of the well-articulated development pathway and the existing comparative advantages, without trade, Africa is unlikely to enjoy the full benefits of its transformation process. Fortunately, the recognition of trade as a key development tool in Africa is not in doubt. Past and present development strategies have endeavoured to unlock latent economic potential through trade, albeit with mixed results. The regional integration process as a development imperative in Africa has consistently placed market integration at the heart of efforts to realise an integrated and prosperous African market. Indeed, contrary to widely held perceptions, Africa is on track as per the Abuja Treaty. There are also efforts to address speed bumps that could slow the process as evidenced by the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) between COMESA (the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa), EAC (the East African Community) and SADC (the Southern African Development Community), and the launch of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) negotiations.
   This chapter presents and analyses the results and empirical evidence based on the trade policy landscape in which Africa has been involved and also the prospects of the current initiatives, such as the Tripartite Free Trade Area and the CFTA. Based on the evidence, the chapter argues that it is possible for Africa to ride on trade, not only to industrialize by exploiting the continental market, but also bring about structural transformation in which services play a critical role. But for this to happen, Africa must harness regional integration to the fullest while at the same time making maximum use of the opportunities the multilateral trading system offers. In a global political economic context where there is a multiplicity of trade agreements, this chapter argues that the sequencing of actions and the scope of the agreements are important determinants of the final development outcome.

TI Impact assessment of climate policy on Poland'spower sector
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB This article addresses the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on Poland's conventional energy sector in 2008-2020 and further till 2050. Poland is a country with over 80% dependence on coal in the power sector being under political pressure of the European Union's (EU) ambitious climate policy. The impact of the increase of the European Emission Allowance (EUA) price on fossil fuel power sector has been modelled for different scenarios. The innovation of this article consists in proposing a methodology of estimation actual costs and benefits of power stations in a country with a heavily coal-dependent power sector in the process of transition to a low-carbon economy. Strong political and economic interdependence of coal and power sector has been demonstrated as well as the impact caused by the EU ETS participation in different technology groups of power plants. It has been shown that gas-fuelled combined heat and power units are less vulnerable to the EU ETS-related costs, whereas the hard coal-fired plants may lose their profitability soon after 2020. Lignite power plants, despite their high emissivity, may longer remain in operation owing to low operational costs. Additionally, the results of long-term, up to 2050, modelling of Poland's energy sector supported an unavoidable need of deep decarbonisation of the power sector to meet the post-Paris climate objectives. It has been concluded that investing in coal-based power capacity may lead to a carbon lock-in of the power sector. Finally, the overall costs of such a transformation have been discussed and confronted with the financial support offered by the EU. The whole consideration has been made in a wide context of changes ongoing globally in energy markets and compared with some other countries seeking transformation paths from coal. Poland's case can serve as a lesson for all countries trying to reduce coal dependence in power generation. Reforms in the energy sector shall from the very beginning be an essential part of a sustainable transition of the whole nation's economy. They must scale the power capacity to the future demand avoiding stranded costs. The reforms must be wide-ranging, based on a wide political consensus and not biased against the coal sector. Future energy mix and corresponding technologies shall be carefully designed, matched and should remain stable in the long-term perspective. Coal-based power capacity being near the end of its lifetime provides an economically viable option to commence a fuel switch and the following technology replacement. Real benefits and costs of the energy transition shall be fairly allocated to all stakeholders and communicated to the society. The social costs and implications in coal-dependent regions may be high, especially in the short-term perspective, but then the transformation will bring profits to the whole society.

SO URBAN RESEARCH & PRACTICE
AB In recent times, African governments have been adopting explicit National Urban Policies (NUPs). The adoption of NUPs is a sharp contrast to the past when some governments were ambivalent to it. Focusing on eight (8) African countries-South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, we undertook systematic content analysis of the written policy documents for each country. African governments recognise the need for coordinated policy responses to enhance sustainable urban growth in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #11) and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The paper cautions against adopting 'silver bullet' solutions to avoid jeopardising the creation of local policy innovations that are more suitable to national and local contexts.

TI Exploring the Sustainability of Resource Flow and Productivity
   Transition in Vietnam from 1978 to 2017: MFA and DEA-Based Malmquist
   Productivity Index Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Resource efficiency is a primary policy goal in many developing countries that are resources suppliers. This study performed a first try to explore the resource productivity and efficiency of an emerging world factory, Vietnam, by applying an improved economy-wide material flow analysis (MFA) integrated with a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based Malmquist productivity index approach (MDEA). Resource flows from 1978 to 2017, and the corresponding utilization efficiency considering the unexpected environmental outputs, as well as productivity were explored in depth. The results highlighted a positive correlation between rapid growth among domestic material consumption (DMC), GDP per capita, and material intensity (DMC/capita) in Vietnam during the last four decades. Meanwhile, the resource productivity (USD/DMC) increased from 82.4 USD/ton to 125 USD/ton (2017), presenting a much slower pace than that of Japan and China. The IPAT-based decomposition analysis highlighted the contribution of rising affluence (94%) and population (21%) to the rapid growing DMC, while the technology factor (DMC/GDP) needed to be further enhanced. Finally, the total factor productivity, when comparing between Vietnam, China, South Korea, and Japan, showed that, on the one hand, the Vietnamese economy has strongly been changed in a positive direction with EFFCH 1.061 and TECHCH 1.046 during the last four decades. One the other hand, Vietnam is still material intensive and has low material productivity. Our analytical results recommend Vietnam to strengthen technology innovation and aim for efficiency enhancement through closely coordinated policies on sustainable resource consumption, carbon reduction, and economic growth, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs 2030).

TI Global Imbalances, Under-consumption and Over-borrowing: The State of
   the World Economy and Future Policies
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB This contribution addresses the question of whether growth convergence can be sustained in the global economy without compromising welfare and without causing major crises. It employs a simplified stock-flow analytical framework to examine the proposition that the pace and pattern of global growth is conditioned by 'under-consumption' in some regions of the world and 'over-borrowing' in other regions. A baseline projection using the Cambridge-Alphametrics model (CAM) illustrates consequences of resumed global imbalances after the 2008-2009 crisis. An alternative scenario exemplifies the case in which China and India shift towards internal income redistribution and domestic demand-orientated policies and suggests that this will not be sufficient to correct global imbalances or induce improved growth rates in other developing regions. Finally a more ambitious development perspective is simulated. Such a scenario requires internationally-coordinated policy efforts, with a greater role for governments in the management of demand, income distribution and environmental sustainability, as well as measures to reduce instability of exchange rate and commodity markets.

SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB The primary objective of this paper is to make a connection between the Singapore story of land transport policy development and the pathway towards sustainable transport planning. Its innovation is to allow a parallel growth in motorization and public transit. The Singapore experience shows how a range of well-coordinated policies including efforts to control the number of cars in both ownership and usage, and at the same time increase the availability and rider-ship of public transit contribute to a sustainable transport system. The Singapore model provides a valuable reference for not only developing an alternative approach towards sustainable transport in countries where motorization is desired but also for understanding the various parameters important to the formulation of management policies. In particular, the paper contends the Singapore experience provides a model for Asian nations and cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Acid rain and air pollution: 50 years of progress in environmental
   science and policy
SO AMBIO
AB Because of its serious large-scale effects on ecosystems and its transboundary nature, acid rain received for a few decades at the end of the last century wide scientific and public interest, leading to coordinated policy actions in Europe and North America. Through these actions, in particular those under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, air emissions were substantially reduced, and ecosystem impacts decreased. Widespread scientific research, long-term monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling formed the basis for the policy agreements. In this paper, which is based on an international symposium organised to commemorate 50 years of successful integration of air pollution research and policy, we briefly describe the scientific findings that provided the foundation for the policy development. We also discuss important characteristics of the science-policy interactions, such as the critical loads concept and the large-scale ecosystem field studies. Finally, acid rain and air pollution are set in the context of future societal developments and needs, e.g. the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We also highlight the need to maintain and develop supporting scientific infrastructures.

TI Charcoal, livelihoods, and poverty reduction: Evidence from sub-Saharan
   Africa
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB More than 80% of urban households in sub-Saharan Africa use charcoal as their main source of cooking energy, and the demand is likely to increase for several decades. Charcoal is also a major source of income for rural households in areas with access to urban markets. We review studies of the socioeconomic implications of charcoal production and use, focusing holistically on the role of charcoal in poverty alleviation based on four dimensions of poverty defined by the World Bank: (i) material deprivation, (ii) poor health and education, (iii) vulnerability and exposure to risk, and (iv) voicelessness and powerlessness. We draw conclusions from household-level studies to better understand the determinants of participation in charcoal production and sale, and of urban household demand. Poorer households are more likely to participate in the production and sale of charcoal but their participation is mainly a safety net to supplement other income. Although charcoal production contributes to poverty reduction through alternative income-generation opportunities, it can also undermine production of ecosystem services, agricultural production, and human health. Reducing rural household dependence on charcoal requires coordinated policies providing alternative income opportunities for farmers, affordable alternative energy sources for urban households, and more efficient and sustainable approaches for producing and using charcoal. For future research, we emphasize the importance of large-N panel datasets to better understand the net benefits of charcoal production as a poverty-reduction strategy.

TI Does One Decade of Urban Policy for the Shrinking City Make Visible
   Progress in Urban Re-Urbanization? A Case Study of Bytom, Poland
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Planning and managing the declining fortunes of shrinking cities are essential in shaping urban policy in post-industrial urban societies, especially in Central and Eastern European states. Many studies emphasize city management and redevelopment as important policy constituencies for driving revitalization. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about policy-making and the underlying political and socio-economic disagreements that impact successful measures to reverse urbanization and regenerate post-industrial cities. This paper provides a case of urban policy-making for Bytom-a severely shrinking city in southern Poland. This article aims to clarify the mismatch between the city's policy and the socio-economic situation Bytom after 2010. This discrepancy could have weakened effective policy to address shrinkage and revitalization. Statistical and cartographic methods (choropleth maps) helped analyze the socio-economic changes in Bytom and its shrinking. The issues related to the city's policy were based primarily on free-form interviews and the analysis of municipal and regional documents concerning Bytom. The conducted research shows the need for concerted and coordinated policy direction that considers the real possibilities of implementing pro-development projects. Such expectations also result from the opinions of local communities. Finding a compromise between the idea of active support for projects implemented in a shrinking city and an appropriate urban policy is expected. Such an approach also requires further strengthening of social and economic participation in local and regional governance.

AB The urge of sustainable development has received increasing interests among construction industry stakeholders. The construction industry is considered having a major role to participate in implementing the principles of sustainable development, which leads to the development of the discipline of sustainable construction. The International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction (CIB) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme has commissioned the important report on Agenda 21 for Sustainable Construction in Developing Countries (A21 SCDC) to facilitate the development of a strategy for introducing sustainable construction into developing countries. In line with this development, many research works have been conducted in investigating challenges and solutions for promoting sustainable construction in developing countries. It is well appreciated in the existing studies that implementation of sustainable construction in developing countries needs special attention concerning economics and social issue. This article presents comprehensive understanding on the comparison of practising sustainable construction between developed and developing countries. Focus is given to the investigation on the challenges to sustainable construction in developing countries. An empirical study using questionnaire survey was conducted in Malaysia and Hong Kong. The results revealed that the government is the main driver to implement sustainable construction. Suggestion of adopting efficient construction procurement systems to meet sustainable construction challenges is presented.

AB In industrial countries, micronutrients and trace elements have been well researched. In developing countries, however, human nutrient deficiencies are immense due to poor people having insufficient quantity and variety of high-quality nutrient-rich food. The situation is further aggravated by low levels of available nutrients in the soils of some rural areas. Toxicity problems are also poorly studied and often go unnoticed. Some examples of the extent of the need in developing countries are presented by using South Africa as a case Study. Soil and plant analysis plays an important role in finding solutions to the problem in developing Countries. Better cooperation between different disciplines is urgently required to find more sustainable Solutions. Furthermore, attention needs to be given to information access in developing Countries.

TI The Tax-Spend Debate and Budgetary Policy in Austria
SO INTERNATIONAL ADVANCES IN ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB In the aftermath of the 2008 financial and economic crisis, governments developed plans to steer fiscal policies back to a sustainable path. Austria is no exception, since the latest 2012 consolidation package aimed to balance the budget by 2016. For the success of consolidation policies, however, it is of great importance which fiscal policy strategies are pursued. For instance, should the deficit be reduced by reducing expenditure, by increasing revenue, or by a mixed coordinated policy? Empirical evidence from the mid-1990s indicated that Austria's policy makers followed a path according to the spend-tax hypothesis, deciding on expenditure and then caring about the funding of public tasks. Since 1995, the year of Austria's accession to the European Union, fiscal policy frameworks have changed (e.g., Maastricht Treaty, Fiscal Pact), and thus budgetary policies might have changed as well. The current paper provides new econometric evidence for a stable spend-tax fiscal policy decision process in Austria for the last 60 years. Therefore, it seems that the importance of reducing expenditure (about 72 % of the total consolidation volume in the current package) accounts for this principal approach in Austrian fiscal policy making. However, left open is whether the envisioned increase in revenues (about 28 % of the total consolidation volume) might be counterproductive for sustainably balancing the budget.

TI Supply chain models with greenhouse gases emissions, energy usage,
   imperfect process under different coordination decisions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Environmental issues, mainly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are in large part the result of the excessive use of energy in production systems. The scarcity of resources, governmental regulations, and public awareness about sustainability make them expensive for companies. The speed of producing items (production rate) impacts GHG emissions generation in manufacturing, i.e., usually faster production results in more emissions, which is controllable in many cases. The production rate also affects the process quality and reliability; i.e., fast production speeds deteriorate the system fast, resulting in reworking defective items and machine failure. Such quality and reliability issues increase energy consumption and subsequently costs. This paper develops two-level (vendor-buyer) supply chain models that tackle these issues. It considers two coordinated policies: classical and vendor-managed inventory with consignment stock (VMI-CS), where the objective is to find the values of the decision variables that yield the minimum total supply chain cost. It includes the costs of holding inventory, GHG emissions and tax, energy usage, product and process quality, and transportation operations. The decision variables are the order quantity, the number of shipments, and the production rate. The paper compares the numerical results of the two coordination policies. It also provides managerial insights on the economic and environmental performance of the supply chains.

TI Effects of policy and functional (in)coherence on coordination - A
   comparative analysis of cross-sectoral water management problems
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Coherence and coordination among interdependent policy sectors are considered key for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Literature on policy coherence argues that a lack of coordination may lead to policy incoherence; however, literature on coordination also sometimes points to the reversed causality that incoherencies in policies or in governance functions (functional incoherence) may hinder coordinated policy outcomes; in fact, these assumptions have rarely been further theorized or tested empirically. In this paper, we hypothesize the higher functional or policy coherence, the higher coordination at process level and the higher the likelihood that coordination at process level is translated into coordination at outcome level. We test this hypothesis for cross-sectoral coordination challenges among different water using sectors in six different basins located in Germany, Iran, Mongolia, Spain, and South Africa. At first glance, four cases seem to confirm the first part of the hypothesis for functional coherence and three for policy coherence. It remains difficult to establish causality. Whether functional and policy coherence translate into coordination at process level seems to depend on a functioning coordination body. We further find that functional and policy incoherencies may either lead to coordination problems (in view of conflicts of interest) or even go along with a high level of coordination at the process level, possibly to compensate for incoherencies. Neither functional nor policy coherence change the relationship of coordination at process and outcome level. To explain coordination at the outcome level, other factors need to be considered.

TI Effectiveness of low-carbon development strategies: Evaluation of policy
   scenarios for the urban transport sector in a Brazilian megacity
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This paper evaluates low-carbon urban development strategies for the transport sector in Sao Paulo, one of the largest cities in the world. For each mobility policy selected, we build scenarios to evaluate the potential of mitigating GHG emissions, shedding light on institutional aspects, benefits and risks of implementing each measure. Selected policies analyzed in this paper focus on: (i) reduction of frequency and distance of motorized trips; (ii) improvement of public transport; and (ii) technological issues, from improvement of fuel efficiency of all transport modes to replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels. Results show that the measures that present the highest potential to reduce GHG emissions are those that promote the use of biofuels, particularly ethanol, followed by those that favor the use of public transport. Moreover, simulations of integrated policies evidence that their effectiveness depends upon the adoption of coordinated policies at Federal, State and Local levels. Lastly, we highlight the complementary nature of the proposed policies and the contribution of scenario building to the debate on the strategic planning of integrated urban public policies to promote sustainable development in Sao Paulo City.

TI Linkages between climate change and sustainable development
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Climate change does not yet feature prominently within the environmental or economic policy agendas of developing countries. Yet evidence shows that some of the most adverse effects of climate change will be in developing countries, where populations are most vulnerable and least likely to easily adapt to climate change, and that climate change will affect the potential for development in these countries. Some synergies already exist between climate change policies and the sustainable development agenda in developing countries, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and sustainable land-use policies. Despite limited attention from policy-makers to date, climate change policies could have significant ancillary benefits for the local environment. The reverse is also true as local and national policies to address congestion, air quality, access to energy services and energy diversity may also limit GHG emissions. Nevertheless there could be significant trade-offs associated with deeper levels of mitigation in some countries, for example where developing countries are dependent on indigenous coal and may be required to switch to cleaner yet more expensive fuels to limit emissions. The distributional impacts of such policies are an important determinant of their feasibility and need to be considered up-front. It follows that future agreements on mitigation and adaptation under the convention will need to recognise the diverse situations of developing countries with respect to their level of economic development, their vulnerability to climate change and their ability to adapt or mitigate. Recognition of how climate change is likely to influence other development priorities may be a first Step toward building cost-effective strategies and integrated, institutional capacity in developing countries to respond to climate change. Opportunities may also exist in developing countries to use regional economic organisations to assist in the design of integrated responses and to exploit synergies between climate change and other policies such as those designed to combat desertification and preserve biodiversity.

TI Sign here, please! On developing countries' market access conditions in
   regional trade agreements
SO REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Have regional trade agreements (RTAs) improved market access conditions for developing countries? Employing a measure expressing effective tariff margins and using disaggregated panel data for a sample of 45 developing country exporters, 60 export destinations, and the period between 1991 and 2015, it is shown that this question can generally be answered in the affirmative. Although the effect is estimated to be moderate, RTAs might thus be an important long-run building block in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to increase developing countries' participation in world trade. On closer inspection, however, for the countries included in the sample, there is considerable variation depending on the choice of integration partners and economic sectors. More specifically, market access improvements cannot be found for African economies in South-South agreements and developing countries engaging formally with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) or the Republic of Korea, while leading industrialized nations are reluctant to grant improved market access to developing countries in RTAs especially in capital-intensive (high-productivity) manufacturing sectors.

AB The 2.4 billion working people in the developing countries often have to endure employment conditions, which do not meet even basic occupational safety and health (OSH) standards. The lack of work safety, excessive work loads, and occupational physical, chemical and biological exposures result in occupational diseases, injuries and as many as 1.2 million fatalities each year. Furthermore, as little as 15% of workers in the developing countries have access to occupational health and safety services. Some collaboration between the industrialized and developing countries in the field of OSH has been practiced for 30 years but its volume has been modest compared to other sectors of development assistance. The lessons learned from 30 years of experience are that the most important OSH improving factors in developing countries include legal and policy instruments, national OSH programs, infrastructure for OSH implementation, and OSH services. The establishment of OSH expert human resources, centers serving as engines for research, training, as well as information and registration systems can also be considered as key factors in any such collaboration. A convincing government OSH policy, and close cooperation between social partners and the government are also critical factors that guarantee sustainable OSH programs in a developing country over a long-term basis.

TI Risk Severity Matrix for Sustainable Public-Private Partnership Projects
   in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The concept of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is not new for developing countries, although many initiatives are being contemplated for potential implementation. This paper evaluates the crucial success factor for the effective execution of PPP projects and it also investigates the appropriate distribution of the risks involved in PPP projects. Quartile analysis of features has been made after a detailed literature review for risk identification. The risk severity analysis is done using a quartile assessment. The data is collected from various contractors working on PPP projects in Pakistan. The comparative analysis has been conducted using available research work on PPP in developing countries. A risk severity rank model is created using 47 key risks in PPP projects for developing countries. Finally, the top risks identified by this research are compared with the previous studies conducted in China, India and Egypt. It is concluded that inflation, revenue risk from end-user, foreign exchange fluctuation, political situation, law and order, and corruption are the major risks in developing countries for better management of PPP projects. Most of the PPP projects are public-oriented. The society of any city is directly affected by most PPP projects. This paper presents the identified key risks of PPP projects in developing countries which are mostly financial and public-oriented. This work will support the PPP concept significance, meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 and 11. Recent countries' political and economic circumstances and sustainability have transformed PPP ventures into a successful way to support the governments to develop roads, energy and facilities through private partners' financial and technological capacities. Although PPP is used worldwide, its effective utilization in developing countries is still lacking. This paper is an enhancement to its successful use of the PPP domain for developing countries.

AB Access to electricity is one of the most essential requirements for development. Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has predicted that growth in electricity use is projected to largely come from developing countries as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, the transition to clean energy is occurring too slowly in rural parts of developing countries. Renewable energy provides the opportunity for sustainable energy to be provided to those living in rural areas of developing countries, who have not had access to clean energy. Renewable energy technology is necessary because traditional measures of energy access are not able to address the deficiencies in the affordability, reliability, and other barriers associated with renewable energy distribution.
   While there have been several successful rural electrification technologies in the past few years, sustainable technologies still have the potential to be unsuccessful if they fail to overcome the many barriers that stand in the way of energy progression in developing countries. Moreover, a product's technical performance is not a sound indicator of how well that product will be adopted by users. This paper argues that technical and social barriers to renewable energy dissemination have not been surmounted due to a lack of innovation in terms of engineering solutions. Innovative "grid-free" engineering products can enable developing countries to avoid a possible industrial revolution while still growing their economy, since they are not hindered by an electricity grid. This paper identifies technical barriers to renewable energy development from the literature, and suggests possible innovations that can aid rural areas of developing countries in achieving electrification. The technology explored in this paper include super capacitors, a ground-air thermoelectric generator, and photovoltaic solar cells, which all have the potential to provide energy access to those living in less urbanized areas of developing countries.

TI The Sustainability of the WTO Dispute Settlement System: Does It Work
   for Developing Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Our study provides an econometric analysis of whether developing countries are disadvantaged by the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) dispute settlement procedure. Despite the many successes of the Dispute Settlement Board (DSB), there is a need to better understand the overall effectiveness of the dispute mechanism. Using bilateral data of WTO members from 1995 to 2017, this article describes the influencing factors for developing countries' participation in the dispute settlement process. By conducting a rare events logistic regression analysis, the results from this study show that the key factors that determine the ability for a developing country to initiate a dispute against another country include the export intensity, retaliation capability, economic power, and economic threat from potential defendant countries. This means that not all developing countries can participate in trade dispute settlement mechanisms, so the WTO dispute settlement system has relative legitimacy. In addition, we further compare and analyse the influence of these four dimensions over different time periods and in different target countries through seemingly unrelated estimations.

AB The technological capacity building is one of the critical factors for the national development in developing countries. Especially, the establishment and management of relevant technological organization is a prerequisite for the technological capacity building in one's nation. In developing countries, not like developed countries, there are more factors to consider in the establishment of technological organization such as governance issue and sustainability. In this paper, the case of National Technology Innovation Center in Katmandu University, which is supported by Korean International Cooperation Agency, is analyzed. In the technology transfer related literature, it is argued that the absorptive capacity and transfer capacity are important in external technology learning and commercializing process. The case study shows that the absorptive capacity of developing country and transfer capacity of donor country are important as noted in the literature. In addition, the willingness to learn from the recipient organization is also critical in utilizing foreign technological aids. Even the study of one country case is not enough, it will give some practical knowledge to understand the establishment of technological infrastructure in the developing countries.

TI Dynamic linkages between globalization, human capital, and carbon
   dioxide emissions: empirical evidence from developing economies
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study examines the impact of human capital and globalization on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for a sample of 78 developing countries, from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, over the period from 1990 to 2016. As opposed to the existing studies in the literature, this study considers three types of globalization namely economic, social, and political globalization. The econometric analysis involves the use of the two-stage least squares-generalized method of moment method to account for endogeneity issues. The findings, overall, indicate that human capital development decreases CO2 emissions in developing countries across all regions. In contrast, social globalization increases CO2 emissions in all developing countries. Moreover, the empirical results also reveal that political globalization boosts CO2 emissions in the Latin American and Caribbean region, but helps to curb CO2 emissions in Asia, Africa, and in overall panel. Additionally, economic globalization significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the Latin American and Caribbean region but increases CO2 emissions in Asia, Africa, and in overall panel countries. Furthermore, human capital and globalization (in all three forms) jointly boost CO2 emissions. Hence, in line with this major finding, we recommend that the globalization policies should also incorporate the human capital development agenda of the developing countries in order to comprehensively tackle the aggravation of CO2 emissions.

TI Addressing uncertainty in decarbonisation policy mixes - Lessons learned
   from German and European bioenergy policy
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB For promoting innovation in the context of sustainability transitions, research emphasizes the importance of combining technology-push and demand-pull instruments in a coordinated policy mix. Designing such policy mixes, however, remains challenging, due to path dependencies, interacting market failures, and uncertainty regarding eventual economic, environmental and societal impacts of innovations. This results in the need for a learning and flexible policy design, but simultaneously, stable political framework conditions are required to bring about lasting changes in production and consumption behaviour. This paper undertakes an economic assessment of how this trade-off between flexibility and stability has been addressed in practice, focussing on a case study of the European and German bioenergy policy mix which serves as a prime example for the challenges of dealing with uncertainty (e.g. regarding land use impacts, GHG balances, cost developments). Informed by the theory of second best, new institutional economics and the interdisciplinary policy mix literature, we identify dimensions for assessing whether relevant uncertainties, interactions between market failures and other constraints on first-best policy making have been handled in a rational manner. From the case study, we derive lessons for bioeconomy policy, as a further example of a decarbonisation policy mix faced by high uncertainty and complexity.

SO RECHERCHE ET APPLICATIONS EN MARKETING-ENGLISH EDITION
AB Through his research experience in developing countries, Eric Arnould asserts that questions about sustainable development are historically linked to problems of access by populations in the global South to development programs financially, socially and environmentally fit to ensure their well-being. Therefore, thinking through marketing's potential contribution and taking action in the context of sustainable development in the global South requires posing questions at two levels: at a macro level, to understand the links between local and international markets and the local effects of these linkages; and at cultural level, to understand economic stakeholders' behaviors within their specific cultural and institutional contexts.

   Possibilities in Developing Countries
SO HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND CLINICAL SCIENCE: CONCEPTS, METHODOLOGIES,
   TOOLS, AND APPLICATIONS
AB Healthcare sector is now using telemedicine solutions to increase the reach of its services to population. Target areas are highly sparsely distributed devoid of basic amenities which makes the job of Governments difficult. Further people don't have enough disposable income to travel long distances and take preventive health care from urban areas. Problems are uniformly the same across the developing countries. The mindboggling developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) particularly the web based technologies have opened up exciting new possibilities for health care across the world. These developments have evoked significant policy response in developing countries where the quality of health care is poor, resources are scarce and demands have to be immediately met. Telemedicine is gradually coming up as a viable policy option for the Governments in developing countries. This chapter gives an account of the telemedicine initiatives taken in India, describes emerging regional cooperation and its contribution for Sustainable Development Goals.

TI National Climate Change Policies and Sustainable Water Management:
   Conflicts and Synergies
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Even in the absence of climate change, freshwater ecosystems and the resources they provide for people are under great pressure because of increasing demand for water and declines in water quality. The imminent onset of climate change will exacerbate these impacts, placing even greater pressure on already stressed resources and regions. A plethora of national climate change policies have been adopted that emphasize structural adjustment in the energy sector and increasing carbon sinks. To date, most public debate on water has focused on the direct impacts of climate change on hydrology. However, there is growing evidence that climate change policies themselves may have substantial additional and negative impacts on freshwater resources and ecosystems and may thus result in maladaptation. To avoid such maladaptation, integrated, coordinated policy making is required. In this paper, national climate change policies from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union (EU), India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom are compared to: (i) identify where negative trade-offs exist between climate change policies and freshwater resources, (ii) analyze where institutions and structures exist to optimize integration among climate, water, and biodiversity policies, and (iii) provide a much needed overview from a broad selection of countries with a view to identifying further opportunities for theoretical exploration and testing. The synergies and conflicts among climate, energy, water, and environmental policies create additional challenges for governments to develop integrated policies to deliver multiple benefits. Success factors for better policy development identified in this assessment and synthesis include engagement of senior political leaders, cyclical policy development, multi-agency and stakeholder processes, and stronger accountability and enforcement measures.

TI Financial crises and the attainment of the SDGs: an adjusted
   multidimensional poverty approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB This paper analyses the impact of financial crises on the Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty. To do so, we develop an adjusted Multidimensional Poverty Framework (MPF) that includes 15 indicators that span across key poverty aspects related to income, basic needs, health, education and the environment. We then use an econometric model that allows us to examine the impact of financial crises on these indicators in 150 countries over the period 1980-2015. Our analysis produces new estimates on the impact of financial crises on poverty's multiple social, economic and environmental aspects and equally important captures dynamic linkages between these aspects. Thus, we offer a better understanding of the potential impact of current debt dynamics on Multidimensional Poverty and demonstrate the need to move beyond the boundaries of SDG1, if we are to meet the target of eradicating poverty. Our results indicate that the current financial distress experienced by many low-income countries may reverse the progress that has been made hitherto in reducing poverty. We find that financial crises are associated with an approximately 10% increase of extreme poor in low-income countries. The impact is even stronger in some other poverty aspects. For instance, crises are associated with an average decrease of government spending in education by 17.72% in low-income countries. The dynamic linkages between most of the Multidimensional Poverty indicators, warn of a negative domino effect on a number of SDGs related to poverty, if there is a financial crisis shock. To pre-empt such a domino effect, the specific SDG target 17.4 on attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies plays a key role and requires urgent attention by the international community.

TI Food security status and determinants in North-Eastern rift valley of
   Ethiopia
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB Background: "Food insecurity is a major problem in Ethiopia due to frequent droughts in a country where farmers depend on rain fed agriculture". It is affecting the population that usually experiences food shortage even at the optimal conditions of weather and market in the area. Agro-pastoral areas are characterized by frequent calamities, and lack of adequate infrastructure, social services and institutions in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the food security status and determinants of the agro-pastoral community in northeastern rift valley of Ethiopia. A total of 337 households were selected using simple random sampling techniques. Various descriptive techniques were used to analyze the data. The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke model was employed to estimate the food security indices and the headcount ratio.
   Results: The finding revealed that, about 64% of the sampled households were found to be food insecure. Based on the logit regression model; age, marital status and family size were negatively affected the household food security. Whereas, irrigation land use, livestock ownership and access to credit were affected positively.
   Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that equally promoting male and female agro-pastoral communities in food and nutrition security should be a public issue for accessing sustainable food. Fundamentally, the finding is focused on the need for coordinated policy actions including family planning, providing household credit services, crop insurance and using total livestock units, technology adoption and supporting income diversification. Therefore, future intervention plans should focus on capacity building through enhancing their access to human, financial and physical capital.

TI Land-use planning for natural hazards in New Zealand: the setting,
   barriers, 'burning issues' and priority actions
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Land-use planners have a critical role to play in building vibrant, sustainable and hazard resilient communities in New Zealand. The policy and legal setting for natural hazards planning provides a solid foundation for good practice. But there are many examples of 'bad practice' that result in unnecessary risks and, in some cases, exposure to repeat events and potentially devastating impacts. Much, therefore, remains to be done to improve hazards planning policy and practice in New Zealand. This article explores the questions: What role does land-use planning play in managing hazard risks in New Zealand; and what needs to be done to reduce hazard risks and build community resilience? The article starts by describing the milieu within which natural hazards planning takes place. It goes onto outline the stakeholders and institutional and legal setting for natural hazards planning in New Zealand, including barriers to realising the potential of natural hazards planning. This synthesis reveals a number of 'burning issues', including the need to: (a) Improve understanding about the nature of hazards; (b) Prioritise risk avoidance (reduction) measures; (c) Provide national guidance for communities exposed to repeat events and address the relocation issue and (d) Mainstream climate change adaptation. Each 'burning issue' is discussed, and priority actions are recommended to realise the potential of land-use planning to reduce natural hazard risks and build community resilience in New Zealand. Ultimately, the challenge is to develop a cooperative hazards governance approach that is founded on coordinated policies, laws and institutions, cooperative professional practice and collaborative communities.

TI E-commerce development in rural and remote areas of BRICS countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB E-commerce plays an essential role in modern trade today. It is expected that e-commerce volume amounted to 29 trillion USD in the world in 2017, and would grow with the spread of the Internet and information and communication technologies (ICTs). Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), together with many others, consider e-commerce a means to facilitate rapid, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, improving the living standards and alleviating poverty. This article examines areas for potential cooperation by BRICS countries in e-commerce development across rural and remote areas to fight poverty. It analyses the current state of e-commerce development in rural and remote areas in each of the BRICS countries, including cases of public and private initiatives to support it. The article also defines the opportunities which e-commerce brings to people living in rural and remote areas. Moreover, it evaluates the existing challenges and risks. The article concludes that despite the rapid e-commerce development in BRICS countries, and significant opportunities created, there are still issues of disproportionate e-commerce in varied regions and the lack of BRICS cooperation in this sphere. Based on a comparative and normative in-depth, systematic analysis, the article develops a set of recommendations for deepening BRICS countries? cooperation in the following areas: infrastructure in rural and remote regions; education; consumer protection; online dispute resolution; coordinated policy in the international scene, including representation of BRICS countries in international indexes, such as the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Digital Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI).

TI The Role of Green Finance in Green Innovation: Global Perspective from
   75 Developing Countries
SO EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB Green finance provides an important impetus to green innovation and sustainable development. This study investigates the connection between green finance and green innovation using cross-country panel data that cover 75 developing countries from 2000 to 2019. First, we find that green finance significantly boosts the number of green patent applications in developing countries, which is crucial for promoting green development. Second, we divide countries according to whether they are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or the Belt and Road Initiative, and their environmental performance. Heterogeneity results show in countries with poor environmental performance, non-RCEP member countries, and non-BRI member countries that the contribution of green funding is more obvious and significant. Furthermore, we consider several cross-items to explore how green finance influences green innovation differently depending on the circumstance, such as the degree of corruption, political stability, and government effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight the key role that green finance plays in advancing green innovation, particularly for emerging economies that urgently need a policy foundation for green innovation and sustainable development.

TI IS DIVERSIFIED EXPORT A DRIVER FOR AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IN DEVELOPING
   COUNTRIES? A DYNAMIC MODEL
SO ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN STATISTICS
AB Due to the impact of agricultural sector on economic growth especially in developing countries, study of the factors affecting agricultural growth, including export diversification and trade liberalization is important. Export diversification is considered as increasing the number of export goods in the agricultural sector which leads to sustainable earnings from export and finally income growth. This article provides evidence on the relationship between export diversification and agricultural growth using a panel data set of 20 developing countries during 2000-2014. The study adopted Herfindahl index for export diversity and generalized least squares (GLS) to examine dynamic interactions among the variables. Main results showed that openness, export diversification, rainfall, agricultural areas, labor force and total factor productivity had a positive effect on agricultural growth. Estimated model reveals convergence theory and the hump-shaped relationship between mentioned variables. This finding suggested that, to achieve agricultural growth under trade liberalization, countries should diversify their agricultural export and develop economic cooperation with other countries.

TI THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AND ITS PREREQUISITES IN ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT -
   A VISION FOR FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
SO FOOD POLICY
AB The aim of this paper is to establish a vision for foreign development assistance based upon the evolution of thought and empirical evidence found in the development literature. The paper spotlights the agricultural-led approach. The empirical record shows that agricultural growth had a more pronounced impact on increases in developing-country income than did growth in the nonagricultural sector. The reason for the differential impact is that developing countries focusing on agricultural development experienced more broad-based income growth and increases in the demand for domestically-produced goods; whereas the developing countries promoting rapid industrialization experienced narrow-based income growth, with a demand pattern oriented toward nonfood and capital-intensive products. A precondition for agriculture to play its proper role is the existence of a conducive environment in which private enterprise can flourish. Developing-country governments need to assume responsibility for the creation and maintenance of essential institutions. Government investments are required in education, infrastructure, and other areas where the commercial market is not capable of delivering critical services. Finally, governments must responsibly manage the macroeconomy, pursuing sustainable pricing policies and fiscal and monetary policies that are consistent with real equilibrium exchange rates.

TI A systematic review of micro correlates of maternal mortality
SO REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB In the year 2000, the World Health Organization launched the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which were to be achieved in 2015. Though most of the goals were not achieved, a follow-up post 2015 development agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was launched in 2015, which are to be achieved by 2030. Maternal mortality reduction is a focal goal in both the MDGs and SDGs. Achieving the maternal mortality target in the SDGs requires multiple approaches, particularly in developing countries with high maternal mortality. Low-income developing countries rely to a great extent on macro determinants such as public health expenditure, which are spent mostly on curative health and health facilities, to improve population health. To complement the macro determinants, this study employs the systematic review technique to reveal significant micro correlates of maternal mortality. The study searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Science Direct, and Global Index Medicus of the World Health Organization. Our search was time framed from the 1st January, 2000 to the 30th September, 2016. In the overall search result, 6758 articles were identified, out of which 33 were found to be eligible for the review. The outcome of the systematic search for relevant literature revealed a concentration of literature on the micro factors and maternal mortality in developing countries. This shows that maternal mortality and micro factors are a major issue in developing countries. The studies reviewed support the significant relationship between the micro factors and maternal mortality. This study therefore suggests that more effort should be channelled to improving the micro factors in developing countries to pave the way for the timely achievement of the SDGs' maternal mortality ratio (MMR) target.

AB Library services in the 21st century have moved from the four corners of physical location and printed books to the virtual and ubiquitous solution that includes digital contents accessible in many forms and from anywhere. These new ways of accessing information, managing, and providing library and information services, depend largely on a solid and scalable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, which is supported by stable sources of electrical power and backed by ease of software applications to empower digital platforms for library solutions. Therefore, the lack of reliable ICT platforms, access and policies supported by relevant skill sets are a major challenge to developing countries.
   This paper is about raising the challenges and issues that affect the basic ICT infrastructure for delivering library and information services in some African countries in the 21st Century. The method used is the mixed methodology approach of interviewing and observations. The paper also covers the major challenges facing these countries in developing ICT infrastructure
   It is argued that developing countries have similar issues and challenges with respect to availability of reasonable ICT infrastructure, reliable sources of electric power, high cost of internet bandwidth and ICT equipment as well as lack of technical expertise to manage the life cycle support of technological advancement. To help deal with these challenges, developing countries need the support of global forces and partners to deal with the present ICT infrastructure gaps in order to integrate their economies to accelerate the developmental progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

TI World Heritage Sites in developing countries: Assessing impacts and
   handling complexities toward sustainable tourism
SO JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
AB The current study addresses several concerns regarding World Heritage Sites (WHSs) in developing countries. Using a novel super-efficiency parallel framework, this research firstly elucidates how WHS designation impacts the tourism sector in the 21 developing nations with the greatest number of WHSs from 2000 through 2016. The proposed parallel model assesses the tourism industry at both the macro level in the context of resource-oriented efficiency and the micro level in facility-oriented efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WHS brand positively impacts the tourism demand in developing countries and can be used as a promotional tool. Secondly, this work draws attention to the socio-ecological concerns related to WHSs in developing countries. It sets out a critical and factual discussion based on the current designation and conservation status of WHSs. The analysis highlights an unfair distribution of WHSs between developing and advanced economies and reveals negligence in their preservation, since around 94% of sites labeled In Danger are located in developing nations. The study concludes that the conservation of WHSs is a complex societal problem and offers policy implications for handling heritage inscription and preservation issues in developing countries. Finally, it explores pathways toward sustainable conservation of WHSs, based on United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) for safeguarding heritage and sustainable communities (SDG 11), for more effective institutions (SDG 16), and for fair and nonhegemonic partnership between advanced economies and developing countries (SDG 17). The outcomes may be of practical value to policymakers aiming to improve tourism and heritage management.

AB This paper describes the development of a Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment/Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM/NVI, Bilthoven, The Netherlands), and the subsequent transfer of its production process to manufacturers in developing countries. In 1998, at the outset of the project, the majority of the world's children were not immunized against Hib because of the high price and limited supply of the conjugate vaccines, due partly to the fact that local manufacturers in developing countries did not master the Hib conjugate production technology. To address this problem, the RIVM/NVI has developed a robust Hib conjugate vaccine production process based on a proven model, and transferred this technology to several partners in India, Indonesia, Korea and China. As a result, emerging manufacturers in developing countries acquired modern technologies previously unavailable to them. This has in turn facilitated their approach to producing other conjugate vaccines. As an additional spin-off from the project, a World Health Organization (WHO) Hib quality control (QC) course was designed and conducted at the RIVM/NVI, resulting in an increased regulatory capacity for conjugate vaccines in developing countries at the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) level. For the local populations, this has translated into an increased and sustainable supply of affordable Hib conjugate-containing combination vaccines. During the course of this project, developing countries have demonstrated their ability to produce large quantities of high-quality modern vaccines after a successful transfer of the technology.

   Vaccine Delivery
CY MAY 21-23, 1997
CL UDINE, ITALY
AB Over the years, diseases and epizootics have caused significant production losses to the East-growing aquaculture sector and to the natural aquatic populations in the wild. As a result, disease control and health management have been considered as key contributors to aquaculture sustainability. The risk of diseases and pathogen transfer through trans-boundary movement of infected animals, risk of aquatic environmental pollution, risk to human health and environment due to excessive use of chemicals and drugs, underdeveloped genetic improvement and broodstock management programmes, and lack of adequate knowledge on the role of good nutrition in aquatic animal health management have been identified as key constraints to realizing the full potential of aquaculture. Implementation of the 'systems-approach' has been recognized as an effective means of overcoming such constraints, and strong international cooperation is required to achieve this and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) provides a platform for such cooperation. Guidelines for the implementation of CCRF are envisaged to provide a range of technical, legal, and economic options and tools to the concerned parties to assist rectifying the above shortfalls. However, such technical guidelines, which could be practically applied within developing country situations, can only be developed once adequate information and appropriate technologies are available, and all stakeholders agree to cooperate and collaborate closely. Therefore, considering (a) the need for the developed countries to cooperate on the health management for sustainable aquaculture development in developing countries and (b) the role that the CCRF can play towards achieving responsible aquaculture, this paper describes the possible investment opportunities, which are mutually beneficial to both the developed and developing countries. It emphasizes in particular the collaboration on investment for development and transfer of technologies appropriate for developing countries.

SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE IN FINLAND
CT Seminar in Honour of the 100th Anniversary of MTT
CY AUG 11, 1998
CL JOKIOINEN, FINLAND
AB On a global basis, livestock products - meat, milk, eggs and fibre - account for 40% of the value of total marketed agricultural product. Animal products provide essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals to help ensure nutritionally balanced diets. In developing countries, livestock traction and manure also contribute to food production through improved cultivation and soil fertility which increase crop yields. On average, the proportional contribution of livestock product to dietary calories and protein in developed countries is double that for developing countries. Demand for livestock products is fuelled by the population increase, income growth and urbanisation in developing countries. Therefore, over the past decade, consumption of livestock product has sharply increased in developing countries, while slightly decreasing in developed countries where consumption is already relatively high on average. Increased demand in developing countries increases income for producers, but also stresses the environment through pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and deforestation. Research involving global partnerships of scientists and institutes can help ensure that the increased demands for livestock product in developing countries will be met in economically feasible and environmentally sustainable ways.

TI PneumoADIP: An example of translational research to accelerate
   pneumococcal vaccination in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION
AB Historically, the introduction of new vaccines in developing countries has been delayed due to lack of a coordinated effort to address both demand and supply issues. The introduction of vaccines in developing countries has been plagued by a vicious cycle of uncertain demand leading to limited supply, which keeps prices relatively high and, in turn, further increases the uncertainty of demand. The Pneumococcal Vaccines Accelerated Development and Introduction Plan (PneumoADIP) is an innovative approach designed to overcome this vicious cycle and to help assure an affordable, sustainable supply of new pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries. Translational research will play an important role in achieving the goals of PneumoADIP by establishing the burden of pneumococcal disease and the value of pneumococcal vaccines at global and country levels. If successful, PneumoADIP will reduce the uncertainty of demand, allow appropriate planning of supply, and achieve adequate and affordable availability of product for the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines. This model may provide a useful example and valuable lessons for how a successful public-private partnership can improve global health.

TI Working across borders to promote positive mental health and well-being
SO DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB World health reports highlight the increasing prevalence of mental health problems and the need to recognize that mental well-being is a fundamental aspect of any health policy. The scale and cost of mental health problems mean that appropriate policies and strategies must be developed and implemented. In Ireland this is a period of substantial review and reflection on mental health policy and practice, but to date little consideration has been given to the development of a cross-border strategy. Cooperation and collaboration has been largely dependent on the leadership of a number of individuals supported by short-term European Union funding. This paper is informed by a study which was concerned with examining the issues associated with promoting mental health across the Irish border. Insights were provided by 38 individuals who were involved in the delivery of cross-border mental health services in the North West region. The article argues that there is substantial support for working across borders and developing sustainable cross-border health strategies. In the absence of a statutory all-Ireland coordinated policy overseeing the development of mental health promotion, the sustainability of projects emerged as a key issue. The results suggest that whilst much innovative and creative work has been undertaken by committed individuals, what is now required is a strategic response from both the British and Irish governments which will ensure the needs of service users in these deprived border regions can be effectively addressed. Also, at a policy level this strategic development would be seen as a reflection of the value placed on promoting mental health and well-being.

AB BioNET-INTERNATIONAL is the Global Network for Capacity building in taxonomy for sustainable development. Taxonomy (or biosystematics) is the basic underpinning science of all biology-and thus of all environmental management. Without sound taxonomy, no knowledge is available on living organisms, and if you don't know what you have, you cannot determine how to manage, conserve, or sustainably use biological resources. The Global Network is comprised of a number of interlinked regional Locally Organized and Operated Partnerships (LOOPs) of developing country institutions, supported by a consortium of developed country institutions. Its purpose, through South-South cooperation and North-South partnerships for institutional strengthening and human resource development, is to enable developing countries to achieve self-reliance in taxonomy to support regional and national programs for eradication of poverty, via sustainable agricultural development and use of natural resources, and by full implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
   The network's success is attributable to two key components. The first is local ownership of the process, including governmental endorsement of the need for such a capacity-building network, whereby needs are identified and prioritized by member countries themselves. The second is a tried and tested mechanism whereby a lack of individual country capacity is overcome by pooling, optimizing, and sharing regional capacity on a reciprocal basis between member countries. It provides a very useful model for other capacity-building initiatives in developing countries, as well as for North-South and South-South collaborative partnerships for capacity building.

TI Late industrialization in the Sustainable Development Goals: a critical
   perspective from the Argentine experience
SO GLOBALIZATIONS
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have incorporated late industrialization once more into the global development agenda. Nonetheless, the importance that is given to WTO's rules in the SDGs makes it pertinent to re-examine the debate about the 'policy space' in which developing countries pursue late industrialization. The premise in the SDGs is that WTO's rules will demarcate the policy space developing countries will have to pursue industrial policies. This article argues that the WTO could demarcate the 'policy space' only if developing countries lack access to non-conditional external finance. The accessibility of low-conditionality sources of external financing permits countries to avoid conditionalities and hence widen the space to use policy instruments inconsistent with the neo-liberal rational the SDGs industrial agenda vindicates. Argentina's re-industrialization programme (2003-2015) is used to illustrate how having access to low-conditional external finances allowed Argentina to escape WTO's rules to implement State-led industrial policies after a default.

TI Barriers to supportive care during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in
   West Africa: Results of a qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   During the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, supportive care was the only non-experimental treatment option for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, providing care that would otherwise be routine for most clinical settings in the context of a highly contagious and lethal pathogen is much more challenging. The objective of this study was to document and deepen understanding of barriers to provision of supportive care in Ebola treatment units (ETUs) as perceived by those involved in care delivery during the outbreak.
   Methods
   This qualitative study consisted of 29 in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (decision-makers, physicians, nurses) involved in patient care delivery during the outbreak. Analysis consisted of interview debriefing and team-based transcript coding in NVivo10 software using thematic analysis.
   Findings
   Participants emphasized three interconnected barriers to providing high-quality supportive care during the outbreak: 1) lack of material and human resources in ETUs; 2) ETU organizational structure limiting the provision of supportive clinical care; and 3) delayed and poorly coordinated policies limiting the effectiveness of global and national responses. Participants also noted the ethical complexities of defining and enacting best clinical practices in low-income countries. They noted tension between, on one hand, scaling up minimal care and investing in clinical care preparedness to a level sustainable in West Africa and, on the other, providing a higher level of supportive care, which in low-resource health systems would require important investments.
   Conclusion
   Our findings identified potentially modifiable barriers to the delivery of supportive care to patients with EVD in West Africa. Addressing these in the inter-outbreak period will be useful to improve patient care and outcomes during inevitable future outbreaks. Promoting community trust and engagement through long-term capacity building of the healthcare work-force and infrastructure would increase both health system resilience and ability to handle other outbreaks of emerging diseases.

TI Social Network of Small Creative Firms and Its Effects on Innovation in

SO SAGE OPEN
AB This article aims to extend the current understanding of social networking in small creative traditional sectors in developing countries. Most of the relevant studies have tended to focus on developed countries while neglecting the developing countries perspective. However, our study stresses that small craft firms-subsector of creative industries-are not only significant for income and employment generation but these businesses also are dominant in most of the developing countries. Hence, this article develops a model to demonstrate the effects of social networking on innovation and thus entrepreneurial success in small creative firms from developing countries perspective. We empirically tested our proposed research model on a sample of 254 small creative firms in the craft sector located in Bangladesh. Our results suggest that small creative firms can and do benefit from establishing a cooperative relationship with buyers, suppliers, and designers. However, cooperation with competitors does not have a significant impact on innovation. The findings of our study have substantial implications for both practitioners and policymakers interested in enhancing innovation among small creative firms mainly craft sector. In particular, we argue that a small creative firm's innovative activity benefits from close relations with suppliers and designers.

AB Background: Establishment of telemedicine programs as tool to help restructuring healthcare system in post-conflict countries as well other developing countries in a sustainable fashion, and to rebuild their health care systems to meet the needs of citizens. Establishing sustainable telemedicine has become a goal of many developing countries around the world. Yet, despite initiatives from a select few individuals and on occasion from various governments, often these initiatives never mature to become sustainable programs.
   Methods: A program known as "Initiate-Build-Operate-Transfer" (IBOT), is a comprehensive, four-pronged strategy that allows for development and implementation of successful sustainable telemedicine system not only in post conflict countries but countries in transition and developing countries.
   Results: Using IBOT strategy, we have built three national programs (Kosovo, Albania and Cabo Verde) in all 46 hospitals of these three countries. Currently we have partnered to build telemedicine in Vietnam building telemedicine.
   Conclusion: IBOT includes assessment of healthcare needs of each country, the development of a curriculum and education program, the establishment of a nationwide telemedicine network, and the integration of the telemedicine program into the healthcare infrastructure.

   freight-passenger transport? A multi-perspective analysis from urban
   China
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB Integrating goods movement into public/mass rapid transit (MRT) is an emerging initiative to improve urban freight transport services and sustainability. This paper explores new prospects to achieve extensive non-road city logistics based on a deep freight-on-rail-transit (FoRT) strategy. To begin, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deep FoRT are analyzed in view of the development status quo of urban China. Next, a multi-criteria assessment model driven by real-world data and 11 quantified metrics is proposed to judge the suitability for developing the MRT-based integrated logistics system (MILS) in 16 Chinese cities. Finally, critical factors influencing MILS project adoption are explicated, and the possible supportive policies are discussed from aspects of planning, regulation, funding, marketization, and innovations. Results show that the alignment with national development goals, rich social-environmental benefits, and stakeholder interest are the primary drivers of deep FoRT strategy, whereas poor planning and decision-making, governance and management deficiencies, and high investment could be the main hurdles. Priority of MILS project adoption in the selected cities is divided into four tiers, where Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen are recognized as the three best candidates. Strong and coordinated policies are needed to integrate the strategy into urban planning.

TI USING THE DELPHI METHOD FOR DETERMINING CRITERIA IN AGROFORESTRY
   RESEARCH PLANNING IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Planning agroforestry research programs requires the participation of people from many disciplines. They may have different interests in allocating financial resources for research purposes and, therefore. the decision-making is complex. Guidelines are needed to improve the decision-making process. Such guidelines may include a fist of weighted criteria identified by experts through group processes. This study used a qualitative approach (the Delphi method) to identify criteria to be used when planning agroforestry research programs in the developing countries. The panel of respondents was comprised of agroforestry experts who have experience and expertise in the developing countries. Fourteen (14) criteria were identified in questionnaire 1. These criteria were ranked in questionnaires 2 and 3. A Friedman test of analysis of variance followed by a Mann-Whitney U test of pairwise comparison produced four groups of criteria: group 1, the most highly ranked, comprises local people's needs, sustainability, adoptability and research quality; group 2 includes existing systems and economic criteria; group 3 encompasses biophysical effects, institutional capabilities, partnership and transferability; and group 4, the least ranked. includes diversity of products, tree/crop interface, flexibility and species selection. A Kruskal-Wallis test on each criterion and several respondent characteristics showed that the respondent characteristics of current work, highest degree held, ecosystem experience, geographic area of experience, and number of years experience influenced respondent criteria rankings. The test was not significant for background and respondent origin characteristics.

TI Stakeholder Expectations of Future Policy Implementation Compared to
   Formal Policy Trajectories: Scenarios for Agricultural Food Systems in
   the Mekong Delta
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The development of a coherent and coordinated policy for the management of large socio-agricultural systems, such as the Mekong delta in southern Vietnam, is reliant on aligning the development, delivery, and implementation of policy on national to local scales. Effective decision making is linked to a coherent, broadly-shared vision of the strategic management of socio-agricultural systems. However, when policies are ambiguous, and at worst contradictory, long-term management and planning can consequently suffer. These potential adverse impacts may be compounded if stakeholders have divergent visions of the current and future states of socio-agricultural systems. Herein we used a transferable, scenario-based methodology which uses a standard quadrant matrix in order to explore both anticipated and idealized future states. Our case study was the Mekong delta. The scenario matrix was based upon two key strategic choices (axis) for the delta, derived from analysis of policy documents, literature, stakeholder engagement, and land use models. These are: (i) who will run agriculture in the future, agri-business or the established commune system; and (ii) to what degree sustainability will be incorporated into production. During a workshop meeting, stakeholders identified that agri-business will dominate future agricultural production in the delta but showed a clear concern that sustainability might consequently be undermined despite policy claims of the contrary. As such, our study highlights an important gap between national expectations and regional perspectives. Our results suggest that the new development plans for the Mekong delta (which comprise a new Master Plan and a new 5-year socio-economic development plan), which emphasize agro-business development, should adopt approaches that address concerns of sustainability as well as a more streamlined policy formulation and implementation that accounts for stakeholder concerns at both provincial and national levels.

TI Does development assistance reduce climate vulnerability in developing
   countries? an empirical investigation
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Increasing climate vulnerability in developing countries impedes inclusive and sustainable development. The paper examines the linkages between official development assistance (ODA) and climate vulnerability while analysing the mediating role of adaptation readiness in 119 developing countries using a panel correlated standard error estimator. The study also investigates the relationship between ODA's sectoral composition and climate vulnerability. The findings reveal that ODA is positively associated with climate vulnerability across all models and regions. However, ODA disbursement according to governance readiness criteria is associated with low vulnerability. The sectoral analysis reveals that the share of social infrastructure, humanitarian, and debt assistance is more in highly vulnerable countries. In contrast, these countries receive less aid specific to production, economic infrastructure, and multi-sector, and donors commit most climate-related ODA in these sectors. Overall, findings suggest a lack of adaptation mainstreaming into ODA disbursements. Furthermore, it calls for exploiting unexplored opportunities for vulnerability reduction through ODA in those sectors where the share of ODA is high in vulnerable countries.

TI Factors enabling systematized national school health services in Japan
SO PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Background Japan has provided nationwide school health services since 1872. However, the system used and the factors enabling this provision have not been fully and systematically explored. This study aimed to provide an overview of the system and identify enabling factors for the provision of school health services in Japan, to support successful implementation in developing countries. Methods We reviewed research papers and related documents and identified factors likely to support successful provision of school health services in developing countries. Results The following six key factors were identified that support systematized, nationwide school health service provision in Japan: (i) existence of a legal basis for school health services provision, (ii) partnership between the education and health sectors, (iii) a systematized supervision system at all administrative levels, (iv) clear definition of essential services and stakeholders' responsibilities, (v) utilization of skilled human resources for school health services at school level, and (vi) regular assessment of children's health issues. Conclusion Five factors were proposed as essential for successful provision of school health services in developing countries: (i) formulation of national school health policies and guidelines with clear definitions of essential health services and stakeholders' responsibilities, (ii) strengthening partnerships within and between health and education sectors at all administrative levels, (iii) building cooperation between school and health professionals and at the community and school levels, (iv) establishing sustainable development of personnel for school health in the education sector, and (v) developing systems for collecting children's health data, assessing their health issues, and monitoring and evaluating the implementation.

TI Thriving and prosperous: How we rallied to confront collective
   challenges
SO JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
AB Scenario analysis can be a useful tool to explore paths to a desirable future. This paper is a 'future history' describing the how stakeholders in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin of North America rallied to confront regional challenges 50 years into the future (2013-2063). This future scenario was developed by considering how nine drivers of change (aquatic invasive species; biological and chemical contaminants; climate change; demographics and societal values; economy; energy; governance and geopolitics; water quantity; and technology) might impact the region. This "thriving and prosperous" scenario envisions that in the beginning, Great Lakes residents, scientists, and policymakers saw "the writing on the wall," recognizing that past approaches to environmental policy failed to provide long-term environmental, social, and economic prosperity. In response, policymakers in the Great Lakes region began formulating and implementing new policies, but actions were scattered across the region and uncoordinated across geopolitical boundaries. Recognizing the need to coordinate their efforts, Great Lakes stakeholders began "marching in step" by agreeing on a common set of guiding principles for future policy actions. Building on this momentum, Great Lakes policymakers implemented a suite of regulations and initiatives that recognized the Great Lakes region as a complex social-ecological system. Between 2053 and 2063, the region began to reap the benefits of coordinated policy action. By 2063, the Great Lakes region showed how a long-term commitment to improving the environment can sustain a thriving and prosperous ecosystem and economy.

TI Blockchain and sustainable supply chain management in developing
   countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Theoretical, empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that there are more violations of sustainability principles in supply chains in developing countries than in developed countries. Recent research has demonstrated that blockchain can play an important role in promoting supply chain sustainability. In this paper we argue that blockchain's characteristics are especially important for enforcing sustainability standards in developing countries. We analyze multiple case studies of blockchain projects implemented in supply chains in developing countries to assess product quality, environmental accounting and social impact measurement. We have developed seven propositions, which describe how blockchain can help address a number of challenges various stakeholders face in promoting sustainable supply chains in developing countries. The challenges that the propositions deal with include those associated with an unfavorable institutional environment, high costs, technological limitations, unequal power distribution among supply chain partners and porosity and opacity of value delivery networks.

TI Morton's Fork: "Democracy" Versus Neopatrimonialism in Developing
   Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB It is argued that conditions for social justice in developing countries are deficient under both state capitalism ("democracy") and neopatrimonialism. Development assistance is similarly constrained, but it also has shortcomings in relation to "democracy" promotion. Political economy analyses can provide authentic insights into how poor people negotiate for public goods, but such interactions seem unlikely to yield sustainable social justice for most citizens. The assessment calls for a reconfiguration of power relations and a more egalitarian distribution of public goods within and between countries, which is what most people are predisposed to want and are entitled to expect and enjoy.

TI Strategies for preventing illicit financial flows in developing
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to critically review the strategies for prevention of illicit financial flows to and from developing countries with a view of ascertaining the most effective strategies to be selected and implemented by developing countries to stem the scourge.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The peer-reviewed journal articles were studied; those that discussed illicit financial flows were selected and reviewed critically using the systematic quantitative assessment techniques together with an output table.
   Findings
   The critical review deduced that enacting effective trade laws, trade regulations, creating a beneficial ownership registry, multinational companies disclosing information on business, automatic exchange of information on tax issues, the Financial Action Task Force 40 guidelines on anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism and domestic and international cooperation are the most reliable strategies that should be implemented by developing countries.
   Research limitations/implications
   The wide geographic scope of developing countries, use of only high-quality databases that restricted the use of other articles and use of public sector perspective are the limitations for this paper.
   Originality/value
   This study is amongst the limited works to discuss the most reliable and effective strategies to prevent illicit financial flows in developing countries.

TI Are Trade and Forests Survival Compatible?
SO FUTURE OF THE WORLDS FORESTS: IDEAS VS IDEOLOGIES
SE World Forests
AB This chapter examines the question of whether trade in forest products from developing countries adds or subtracts value from the standing forests in those countries, and what potential the trade instrument may have in promoting sustainable forest management in developing countries. It is important to bear in mind that only a few tropical countries export a significant proportion of their output, and that in general demand for forest products within developing and transitional economies has been growing rapidly. It is also the case that plantations are rapidly substituting for natural forest outputs in developing countries, not only for commodity grade material, but increasingly for higher quality raw material as well.
   Forest products trade issues have come before the World Trade Organization (WTO) and international consultations in the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) and the International Tropical Timber Organization. Voluntary certification of timber for compliance with sustainable forest management guidelines has grown quickly in the recent two decades, but has to date not produced significant price incentives for certified product from developing countries, nor major impact on deforestation. Illegal logging remains a major impediment to sustainable forest management in general in developing countries: the trade instrument will have some role in addressing this, but much more will be required for success.

AB This paper is an attempt to explore the barriers to integrating sustainability into construction project management in developing countries. To this end, a comprehensive review of the literature is conducted, as a result of which a list of 30 barriers is culled from existing studies. The list of barriers is subsequently assessed in terms of relative importance index (RII) through a survey questionnaire administered to Iranian construction industry experts, resulting in a dataset of 176 completed questionnaires. Findings bring to light the most influential barriers to incorporating sustainability in construction projects for a developing country. These were: (1) lack of understanding of the potential self-benefits of proactivity and high economic risks that unsustainable practices may carry, (2) inadequate assessment of risks and a silo-based approach, namely, insufficient cooperation among practitioners, research institutions and environmental organisations and (3) the lack of a systematic approach to planning and acting for the fulfilment of sustainability goals. As one of the first studies in its kind, the paper offers invaluable insight for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in supporting the transition of construction project management practices towards fulfilling sustainable development goals.

AB In the reality that to have peace and justice all over the world requires a sustainable development. Many organizations, like United Nations, and countries have been working to improve the level of living of people especially in the developing part of the world for many years. In this case the poverty chain which undeveloped and developing countries are facing very much is the huge barrier for these countries to develop their economies. To break the poverty chain, developing countries must have development objectives and an efficient development strategy; furthermore these strategies must be applied ambitiously to get success. Studies have shown that stray, not well planned and not intentioned and half-hearted initiatives have not been sufficient for sustainable development. International cooperation and trade is one of the important steps, may be the first, for sustainable development and full benefit of countries efforts can be realized only with an effective international action. We know that however great undeveloped and developing countries efforts, these will not be sufficient to enable these countries to achieve the desired development goals as expeditiously as they must unless they are assisted through expanded financial resources and more effective economic and commercial policies by the developed countries. In this context since last two decades participation in Global Value Chains has been seen a new and popular way of development together with former strategies like an industrial development strategy.

TI Sustainable vaccine manufacturing in low- and middle-Income countries
SO VACCINE
AB The sustainable manufacturing of vaccines in developing countries is critical to increasing equitable access to vaccines and pandemic preparedness globally. Sustainable manufacturing requires that organi-zations engaged in the development, production and supply of vaccines have viable business models and incentives to manufacture vaccine products.The expanding manufacturing capabilities and capacities of developing countries vaccine manufactur-ers (DCVMs) are increasingly positioning these organizations to meet the national and regional public health needs in developing countries; however, key industry challenges such as regulatory barriers, low prices and demand uncertainty for vaccine products, and limited R&D funding threaten the long-term viability of vaccine manufacturers.This study assesses the technical capabilities, manufacturing capacities, and aspirational plans of DCVMs, exemplifying the business models and strategies undertaken to sustainably manufacture vacci-nes in developing countries. The public health importance of a healthy vaccine industry which enables manufacturers is discussed throughout.Vaccine manufacturers reported diverse product portfolios and R&D pipelines and utilized an array of vaccine technology platforms. Large manufacturing capacities were reported, a critical factor in manufac-turers achieving economies of scale and supplying large volumes of vaccine doses to the world's most populous regions. Partnerships and collaboration within the industry and with international organiza-tions along the vaccine value-chain were cited with high frequency. Manufacturers also reported aspira-tional plans to enter new markets, acquire new technologies and invest in the development of novel and improved vaccines.As DCVMs aim to have an increasing impact on the global vaccine ecosystem, a coordinated multi -stakeholder approach is required alleviate critical industry barriers to ensure that all efforts produce vac-cines are sustainable and enable developing countries to realize the public health benefit of vaccines.

AB This study develops a theoretical model of the linkages between the concepts of sustainable development, CSR, social capital and corporate sustainability. It investigates the process under which a strategic CSR program of a company actually builds the capacity of small enterprises, thereby improving the company's supply chain and sustainability. This research used an exploratory qualitative case study to understand the evolution of the linkages between sustainable development, CSR, social capital and corporate sustainability longitudinally, from 1980 to 2011. Primary and secondary data from company documents, archival records, interviews and observations were analysed to develop a theory. A single case study of micro, medium and small enterprise development (the MSME program) of Astra International (Astra) in the context of Indonesia was chosen as an exemplary case study for theoretical or purposive sampling. The study finds the importance for company to play both public and private roles in achieving its triple bottom line in developing countries. Astra's CSR program is driven by the company' intention to fulfil its needs of strong supply chain by solving the issue of low capacity of MSMEs in Indonesia. By conducting the MSME program, the company builds social capital that improves the capabilities of the owners and workers of small enterprises along the company's supply chain, so they become reliable partners in achieving the company's sustainability objectives. The theoretical model from the research can be replicated by other companies operating in emerging economies. This research adds to the growing number of developing country case studies, particularly from Indonesia, a very large developing country that has been under-researched.

SE SpringerBriefs in Education
AB UN Sustainable Development Goal 10 is to reduce inequalities based upon age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or income within countries. It also concerns inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance. Social exclusion or social marginalization in the developing countries results in many people being denied access to education and relegated to a life of poverty at the fringes of society. This is clearly a moral issue and in breach of human rights. However, what is often overlooked is the economic impact of denying the marginalized opportunities to achieve their potential and participate actively in the economy. This chapter examines the role of open and distance non-formal education in ensuring the right to education of the disabled, refugees, displaced persons and prisoners in the developing countries.

CL LONDON, ENGLAND
AB In 1998 the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) launched the Convention Project on Chemical Safety in developing countries. The project aims to support developing countries in the implementation of the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, create human resources and institutional capacities and to demonstrate via pilot measures how chemical safety in the partner countries can be improved and sustainably implemented in line with international standards. With this objective the development of a Chemical Management Guide (CM Guide) for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries has been initiated. The guide describes a step-by-step approach which is based on identifying 'hot-spots' as a first step, and making a chemical inventory as a second step. The third step is the continuous improvement of chemical management. In total, there are six tools that aim to support the chemical management process: basic concepts for risk assessment; description of control approaches; using material safety data sheets (MSDSs); risk phrases for hazardous substances; safety phrases for hazardous substances; symbols used for labelling hazardous substances. In the course of the test-implementation of the CM Guide in Indonesia, it was found that MSDSs were not available in most of the smaller companies. In contrast, medium-sized and larger companies do have more MSDSs available. It was also found that the way to engage the minds of company owners and managers is with economic arguments related to the loss, waste and expiry of materials, and quality standards expected from importing countries.

TI Environmental Upgrading of Developing Country Firms in Global Value
   Chains
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB While the strategic management literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is abundant, it tends to consider the context of developed countries, with a focus on certain specific issues such as the strategic behaviour of firms with regard to sustainable development and the economic benefits of CSR practices. The present study examines the influence of western organizations on responsible corporate behaviour in developing countries, an issue that has been somewhat neglected in the existing academic literature. In particular, it explores the environmental upgrading of developing country firms in global value chains.
   This research, conducted with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, involves 24 Tunisian olive oil companies. The findings indicate that exporting companies have indeed benefited from environmental upgrading, but, because of the cooperation strategy adopted by leading western firms (imposition of standards) and the absence of financial and technical assistance, the extent of environmental upgrading remains limited.

TI Mineral Export Restraints and Sustainable Development-Are Rare Earths
   Testing the WTO's Loopholes?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB China's actions in limiting the export of rare earths have drawn the world's attention. The USA, Japan, and the European Union (EU) have been frustrated with China's measures, even threatening to bring the case to the WTO. These rare earth trade disputes are but the tip of the iceberg. Forms of export restraints on minerals have been increasingly practiced by developing countries, reflecting developing countries' determination to upgrade their own economic condition against a broader backdrop of international economic transition in a mineral-hungry world. Such issues of mineral export restraints are deeply rooted in the traditional international trade structure, and in turn serve as a historic move to break it. The WTO's consensus-based approach, with developing countries comprising more than two-thirds of WTO membership, has to accommodate this changing situation in both its judicial and negotiation scenarios. Accused of being trade-distorting and inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on the part of mineral export restraints, developing countries expect to defend themselves by reasons of environmental protection and conservation of exhaustible natural resources. This article anticipates that, in the next round of multilateral negotiation, the developed world will attempt to bring the issue of export restraints under multilateral mandates.

   Design/methodology/approach - The paper has broadly reviewed the latest policy changes after China's WTO accession, and literatures on China's trade and economic development issues in order to understand the Chinese success and its speciality, and draw some useful lessons for both China's decision-makers and other developing countries.
   Findings- There are two main findings: first, market liberalization alone is not sufficient, and economic system reform and the liberalization are closely related and complement and promote each other. Second, experimentations via special economic zones (SEZs) and opening to foreign direct investment (FDI), which facilitated and supported cluster development and learning-by-doing, are needed for industrial upgrading and export competitiveness.
   Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the wisdom of China's simultaneous pursuit of domestic economic system reform, and opening to the international market. However, China has also paid a high social and environmental cost for its rapid growth. It is important for developing countries to have an exclusive, balanced and sustainable strategy in the future development.

AB This paper addresses the issue of food security in developing countries and how agriculture plays an important role in achieving not only food security, but also in reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The promotion of trade liberalization by the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) has undermined the productive capacity of developing countries and their comparative advantage in the agricultural sector, marginalizing small-scale farmers and benefitting the big corporations. The paper looks at the issue of intellectual property rights that big corporations have for seeds and their effects on small-scale farmers, and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) is insufficient to regulate the dominance of big corporations in the food and agricultural market. The paper is divided into seven sections: trade liberalization and food security, the WTO and the AoA, the effects of the AoA on developing countries, the role of transnational corporations (TNCs) on food security, CSR and TNCs, policy recommendations, and conclusions.

AB Although the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world host a great diversity of fruit and vegetables, there is a low availability of these products for domestic markets and local consumption. Thus there is a high risk of what is commonly known as the "hidden hunger", which includes nutrient deficiencies and non communicable diseases. Such a situation, coupled with the erosion of local cultures and indigenous knowledge, further contribute to the vicious circle which leads to poor health and environmental degradation.
   More diverse and resilient local food systems - including the sustainable management of local fruit and vegetable species - would make a significant contribution to improving diets and nutrition, and to local economic development. This is the case in the Pacific Islands. Many countries in the Pacific have a rich diversity of fruit, some unique to the Pacific, yet their poor utilization is a contributing factor to some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world.
   To benefit from the nutritional and economic values of fruits and vegetables in developing countries, public policies should be created to promote availability and consumption of fruit and vegetables. A strong public-private multi-sectoral partnership at a local level, which involves all stakeholders in the value chain, is essential. Policy support must promote best practices and apply indigenous knowledge. As increasing urbanization is a challenge in many developing countries, partnerships must undertake the issue of perishable products and promote the importance of traditional products. Innovation is key to promoting and ensuring sustainable utilization of fruit and vegetables, which should be backstopped by appropriate research actions and capacity development.

TI Water utility consultation with the urban poor in developing countries
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
AB Inadequate water services to the urban poor remain a serious problem in developing countries. Where services do exist, the chosen engineering solution often proves unsustainable. Engineers relying heavily on technical expertise can fail to understand the contextual factors determining what poor people want and are willing to pay. Although the concept of appropriate technology options is common enough, technology alone cannot provide a sustainable service. Tariffs and management options must also be designed to meet the needs of the poor. PREPP (participation-ranking-experience-perception-partnership), is a consumer consultation process for use by engineers with the support of social scientists and community development workers. These professionals traditionally see service provision from diverse perspectives and in developing countries they rarely work as a team. Through PREPP, engineers are able to understand the problems of service provision in poor urban settings through the eyes of poor consumers and the professionals that more commonly work with them. Likewise, social sciences professionals are better able to understand engineering parameters. The result is a cost-effective and relatively rapid process that helps engineers to design relevant engineering solutions with more chance of sustainability. Experiences in Zambia, India, Kenya and Uganda are illustrated.

   address climate change
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Identifying what developing countries need to address climate change is of great significance for promoting North-South and South-South climate cooperation and implementing the Paris Agreement. In this study, based on questionnaires surveys of 143 representative government officials, experts, scholars, and industry engineers from developing countries who have been engaged in climate change, the current situation and priority requirements of developing countries in terms of policies and actions, technology, financing, capacity building, and international cooperation for addressing climate change were systematically analyzed. We found that 1. Most developing countries have already taken national general actions and sectoral and industry-level actions focus on renewable or clean energy, waste management and recycling, sustainable urban transport and forestry carbon sequestration. 2. The demands for climate change mitigation are mainly concentrated in technology and capital, and the priority areas are energy and electricity and waste management; for climate change adaptation, the demands differ significantly among regions. 3. Developing countries show high preferences for emission reduction and energy-saving technology, solar energy, wind energy and bio-energy, whereas a low preference for supercritical and ultra supercritical power units, nuclear energy and tidal energy. 4. Agroforestry, energy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy and water resources are priority areas for climate change financing. 5. Building institutional capacity, improving technology R&D networks and institutions, formulation and implementation ability of planning schemes, and data statistics and verification are priority areas needed for capacity building. To better address climate change, developing countries need to establish and improve information exchange channels or platforms and strengthen South-South climate cooperation while optimizing the allocation of climate change resources according to the priority needs.

TI Technology transfer in human vaccinology: A retrospective review on
   public sector contributions in a privatizing science field
SO VACCINE
AB As health intervention, vaccination has had a tremendous impact on reducing mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. Traditionally vaccines were developed and made in the western, industrialised world and from there on gradually and with considerable delay became available for developing countries. Today that is beginning to change. Most vaccine doses are now produced in emerging economies, although industrialised countries still have a lead in vaccine development and in manufacturing innovative vaccines. Technology transfer has been an important mechanism for this increase in production capacity in emerging economies. This review looks back on various technology transfer initiatives and outlines the role of WHO and other public and private partners. It goes into a more detailed description of the role of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. For many decades RIVM has been providing access to vaccine technology by capacity building and technology transfer initiatives not only through multilateral frameworks, but also on a bilateral basis including a major project in China in the 90s of the previous century.
   Looking forward it is expected that, in a globalizing world, the ambition of BRICS countries to play a role in global health will lead to an increase of south-south technology transfers. Further, it is argued that push approaches including technology transfer from the public domain, connecting innovative enabling platforms with competent developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVM), will be critical to ensure a sustainable supply of affordable and quality vaccines to national immunization programmes in developing countries.

TI Lock-in of mature innovation systems: the transformation toward clean
   concrete in the Netherlands
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Energy-intensive processing industries like the concrete industry form the base of the economy and account for a large part of global greenhouse gas emissions. Sectoral transformation to cleaner basic materials is therefore crucial, and institutional pressure to do so is increasing. However, socio-technical studies have not sufficiently addressed these sectors. This paper therefore sets out to analyze the systemic problems that inhibit the transformation of the mature innovation system of the concrete sector toward the development and diffusion of clean concrete innovations, for the case of the Netherlands. A structural-functional approach has been frequently applied to identify such systemic problems, but has been limited to emerging technological innovation systems. Consequently, the approach tends to overlook the systemic lock-in that arises from closed cycles of interdependent systemic problems and vested interests that characterize mature innovation systems and that hamper system transformation. This paper analyzes these characteristics to extend the application of the structural-functional approach to the transformation of mature innovation systems. Interviews with 28 stakeholders were conducted and triangulated with reports, websites and other documents. A list of systemic problems was identified that originate within actors, institutions, networks, technology and infrastructure and that impaired the performance of all system functions except knowledge development. Systemic problems are indeed found to be sustained through systemic lock-in, i.e. closed cycles of interdependent systemic problems. Through strategic, often collective action, established firms with vested interests were able to reinforce these interdependent systemic problems to inhibit clean concrete innovation. The study concludes that systemic lock-in inhibits the sustainability transformation of the mature innovation system of concrete in the Netherlands and confirms that the application of the structural-functional approach can be extended from emerging to mature innovation systems. Overcoming systemic lock-in requires a series of well coordinated policy measures that should be implemented in a specific order, to prevent reverting back to the lock -in around the original system configuration.

SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB The global significance of intellectual property laws is familiar to most of those interested in this area of law. What might be less familiar is the impact of intellectual property on the issue of food security in developing countries. This paper considers the consequences of factors such as TRIPS-plus compliance imposed on recent entrants to the World Trade Organization and the role and impact of patents and sui generis means of protecting plant breeders' rights on food security in developing countries. In particular the paper focuses on examples drawn from the Pacific where island countries are not only considering WTO membership or have recently signed up to this and incurred consequent IP obligations, but where food security is increasingly under pressure due to climate change, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, shifts in agricultural practice and knowledge transfer, changing socioeconomic patterns and the consequences of the global economic crisis. This is also a region where Western models of IP, although prevalent as introduced and imposed concepts, being a legacy of a colonial past, fit uneasily with forms and practices of indigenous traditional knowledge, and where local initiatives may be better suited to ensuring sustainability of food crops than the present thrust of neo-colonial IP laws.

TI Financing Sustainable Development, Which Factors Can Interfere?:
   Empirical Evidence from Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The role of sustainable development financing resources in achieving sustainable development goals is one of the most important topics talked about in the recent sustainable development conflict, especially in the developing countries. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model over the period 2002-2018, this study attempts to better identify sustainable development financing resources and examine their role in simultaneously ensuring economic growth and achieving social and environmental objectives in 24 developing countries. We found that increases in official development assistance, public debt, and remittances impede economic growth and human development and increase environmental pollution. Thus, they inhibit sustainable development. However, our findings demonstrated that foreign direct investment and international trade, which enhance economic growth, do not have any effect on CO2 emissions, while foreign direct investment inflows boost human development and international trade seems detrimental to it. Our study also show the effectiveness of CREDIT in achieving sustainability goals by reducing environmental degradation and improving economic growth and human development. Moreover, these empirical results may draw the attention of policymakers as they help them build rigorous economic policies to sustain economic development.

AB The European Union funded project SAMS (Smart Apiculture Management Services) enhances international cooperation of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and sustainable agriculture between EU and developing countries in pursuit of the EU commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goal "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture". The project consortium comprises four partners from Europe (two from Germany, Austria, and Latvia) and two partners each from Ethiopia and Indonesia. Beekeeping with small-scale operations provides suitable innovation labs for the demonstration and dissemination of cost-effective and easy-to-use open source ICT applications in developing countries. SAMS allows active monitoring and remote sensing of bee colonies and beekeeping by developing an ICT solution supporting the management of bee health and bee productivity as well as a role model for effective international cooperation. By following the user centered design (UCD) approach, SAMS addresses requirements of end-user communities on beekeeping in developing countries, and includes findings in its technological improvements and adaptation as well as in innovative services and business creation based on advanced ICT and remote sensing technologies. SAMS enhances the production of bee products, creates jobs (particularly youths/women), triggers investments, and establishes knowledge exchange through networks and initiated partnerships.

TI Stakeholder Engagement and Responsible Research & Innovation in
   promoting Sustainable Development and Empowerment through ICT
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB ICT plays a significant role in both developed and developing countries across the globe. ICTs are also seen as playing an important role in achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, their importance is seen in terms of achieving sustainable development in the areas of health, education, social inclusion, global partnership and empowerment, among others. However, much ground cannot be made without creating and involving communities and networks that will support the sustainable use and development of ICT in emerging and developing countries. One concept that advocates for the inclusion of communities and establishment of networks around the use and development of ICT is Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). At the core of RRI is the engagement of different stakeholders within communities and networks that are involved with ICT development in emerging and developing countries to ensure sustainable development. Using stakeholder theory, we introduce the work being conducted in the Responsible Research and Innovation Networked Globally (RRING) project to highlight the important role of stakeholders as part of RRI in the use and development of ICTs in emerging and developing countries. In particular, we will discuss how stakeholder engagement as part of RRI can be understood in an emerging country like India, specifically through our discussion of a women's artisan handicraft centre known as Gramshree in the heart of Ahmedabad, India. We aim to highlight aspects of stakeholder engagement, the role of stakeholders in implementing ICTs in women's sustainable development and empowerment. The aim is to showcase how sustainable development and empowerment could be achieved through the formation of a community network around ICT use and development.

TI Enabling financial development: linking innovation and CO2 emissions
   through equity and credit financing
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Over the past decade, financial development has been a prominent debate for stakeholders and policymakers alike. Financial development are prerequisites for innovation and CO2 emissions, followed by the Paris Climate Summit (COP21). In the wake of the global economic recession, financial development continues to address CO2 emissions efforts. However, scant attention is paid to the role of financial development in innovation and CO2 emissions relationship, especially in the context of developing countries. The current study explores the relationship between innovation and CO2 emissions through moderating role of financial development, especially in the context of developing countries. Utilizing a dynamic panel threshold approach, the current study utilizes data from 26 countries between 1990 and 2014. Our findings reveal that innovation positively impacts the reduction of carbon emissions when the stock market value-to-private credit ratio is below 1.71, while an opposite effect is observed when the ratio exceeds this threshold. We believe that the findings broaden the debate on financial development in developing countries. The results revealed that developing countries should allocate their domestic resources to financial development and poverty reduction, rather than solely addressing environmental concerns. In addition, a more sustainable balance between innovation and CO2 emissions could benefit through financial development and the impact may be the result in terms of achieving sustainable development.

AB The energy sector in developing countries plays a key role in their socio-economic development. The sector is facing many challenges, including the escalating demand on energy, the high cost of fuel, importing energy or fuel from external markets, and the unreliable energy supplies. Moving towards renewable energy is also meeting difficulties, especially in terms of delivering the energy needed with reasonable costs. Strategic planning approach is utilized to guide moving towards renewable energy in the developing countries. The aim of this research is to explore the proper measures to deal with the identified key factors that affect progress towards renewable energy, and formulate a strategic framework to support shifting towards renewable energy in the developing countries. Palestine is taken as the case study that could be considered as an example of a lower-middle income developing country. Proper analysis is conducted for the energy sector in Palestine considering the SWOT approach, considering the internal status and the external environment. Based on such analysis, the proposed framework for strategic planning for renewable energy is formulated. The framework has identified the goals and objectives, as well as the strategies and actions. The output of this study would lay the foundation to debate and adopt the framework in partnership with other stakeholders. Key strategies are defined including those in the economic, technical, organizational, regulatory, and behavioural areas.

TI A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Marketplace for Trustworthy Trade in
   Developing Countries
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The possibilities that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) offer for cooperation, development, and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are remarkable. This is because DLTs enable several key features, such as sharing complete information about every data transaction in the distributed system that participants belong to, the immutability of the recorded data transactions, or consensus among what data can be regarded as true, of great usefulness for the implementation of the SDGs. As far as developing countries are concerned, this information could be useful in trading locally produced goods, as it could enhance the reputation and profitability of Small-Scale Producers (SSPs). Unfortunately, it is rare to find a digitalized marketplace that has been specifically implemented for this application domain. This paper puts forward a blockchain-based marketplace that makes use of Smart Contracts and offers information about how the sold goods were produced and can be traced to their very origin. Besides, cloud computing has been conceived to be used in this development from the beginning to reduce the computational resources required by end user operations. An implementation with cloud computing facilities, software components running on the Ethereum blockchain and a web front end have been tested with satisfactory performance results.

TI Financial incentives to poor countries promote net emissions reductions
   in multilateral climate agreements
SO ONE EARTH
AB Reducing global greenhouse-gas emissions needs global cooperation and will have a positive and profound impact on sustainable development. Climate agreements, in line with the UNFCCC, encourage developed countries to provide funds to help developing countries adapt and mitigate. However, up to now, no financial incentive (FI) has been implemented, and it remains unclear to what extent FIs can increase net emissions reductions (ER). Here we investigate a restrictive form of FI, employing both behavioral experiments and game theoretical analysis. We show that FIs significantly increase both ER and social welfare in the absence of any binding enforcement. We also find that the more developed countries invest in FIs, the more developing countries mitigate. This induces developed countries to incentivize developing countries to adapt and mitigate via FIs, resulting in a net global increase in ER. Our results are robust to different monitoring periods, loss probabilities, and mitigation cost ratios.

TI Identifying Project Management Practices and Principles for
   Public-Private Partnerships in Housing Projects: The Case of Tanzania
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite the advocated benefits of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) such as alleviating the housing problems within the developing countries, the PPP implementation process is fraught with several challenges; including project management (PM) related ones. Tanzania, like many developing countries, has higher PPP projects termination rates in comparison to the global average. This suggests a lack of effective PM practices and principles integration. To bridge that knowledge gap, this study applies the theoretical lenses of innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to identify the extent of integration of PM practices and principles during the implementation of PPPs in Tanzanian housing projects. A qualitative approach comprising 10 semi-structured interviews was conducted among PPP practitioners. Directed content analysis was employed for the analysis. Based on frequency of citations, 14 PPPs sustainable PM practices and principles for PPPs implementation are identified. The three most relevant practices and principles were: official and unofficial site visits, documenting the inspections, and site meetings. Assessing the actual work done against the schedule of works was identified as the prevalent project performance of PPP. The results are expected to further nurture an improved appreciation of the best integration PM practices and principles associated with successfully implementing PPPs in housing projects.

TI HIV testing in developing countries: What is required?
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB HIV diagnostic and follow up testing are usually done in laboratory settings. However, in developing countries there is a need to decentralize testing as the majority of the population lives in rural settings. In developing countries stringent quality assurance (QA) practices, which include appropriate training, development of standard operating procedures, maintenance of operator proficiency, routine use of quality control (QC) specimens, standardized data management, equipment calibration and maintenance, and biohazard safety with proper disinfection/disposal procedures are not routinely followed to ensure reliability of results and a safe work environment. The introduction of point-of-care testing technologies involving the use of non-laboratorians in routine testing has further increased the complexity of QA. Therefore, a careful approach towards improvement of laboratories that encourages best practices, coupled with incentives, and review of government policies in point-of-care testing is needed to improve quality of testing as decentralization takes place. Development of a functional laboratory tiered network that facilitates communication, referral, training and problem solving could further enhance confidence in laboratory testing. There is also a need for special considerations in implementing a step-wise approach towards quality improvement, strengthening of the supply chain management, human capacity development, infrastructure upgrade, and strong public private partnerships to ensure long term sustainability of these efforts.

AB Thailand FDI allows countries to enter new markets through imports of goods at lower prices and access to foreign technology because FDI strengthens the economy and increases competition in the era of globalization. Therefore, concerning economic development and regional issues in the context of developing countries Thailand is one of the emergings. Identifying the key factors involved in TFDI is critical for sustainable growth. This study focuses on the factors that define TFDI to CLMV countries using macroeconomic analysis. Quantitative analysis using multiple regression equations on 15-year time series data, during 2005-2019. The results showed that GDP factors, foreign exchange rates, inflation, the proportion of working-age workers to the country's population, and international cooperation are the major driver of Thailand's outward FDI investment.

AB An overview and analysis of the current status of information technology (IT) and its role in animal health research and development (R&D) projects in developing countries have been undertaken. This study is based mainly, but not exclusively, on the Nigerian situation and experience, which are considered to be typical of those in the majority of developing countries where IT is still in its infancy, and few individuals and institutions engaged in R&D projects have access to computing and modem, reliable telecommunications facilities. The analysis has emphasised the following: the limited impact of IT on large-scale field projects; the major factors militating against its successful acquisition, application and transfer; short- and long-term needs and priorities for IT; IT inputs for effective implementation of field projects and exchange of R&D information. Of the numerous factors which have hindered the growth and transfer of IT in much of the developing world, the most important are: (1) weak science and technology (S&T) base; (2) shortage of highly skilled front-line scientists, technologists and information professionals; (3) inadequate financial resources. Experience gained from three field projects highlighted the fact that although IT inputs, such as computers, are vital for the efficient management and rapid communication of research information, careful planning of projects, adequate financial and logistic support, availability of skilled manpower and basic infrastructural facilities are indispensable for the effective utilisation of the inputs. A promising and cost-effective method of transfer of IT inputs to those countries which can hardly afford them at present is through the establishment of institutional research links between developed and developing countries. Successful partnerships usually provide, among other things, computing facilities and manpower training for the latter and opportunity for genuine research collaboration. This form of IT transfer is an important step towards increased application of IT inputs in R&D projects, creation of the much needed inventory of databases and information systems on animal health projects in developing countries. Only then can meaningful exchange of R&D information, in an acceptable format and at affordable price. be realised within and between them. A possible role is envisaged for the major international organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization in ensuring the success and sustainability of these developments.

SO TRANSNATIONAL DISTANCE LEARNING AND BUILDING NEW MARKETS FOR
   UNIVERSITIES
AB In this chapter the author discusses how developing countries are using technology in education when Internet connectivity or electricity is not dependable. Developing countries are embracing educational technologies because they are the fastest, cheapest, and most consistent way to train large numbers of teachers and support education reform. Emerging nations are also enjoying funding opportunities that include public/private partnerships, which contribute to the needed infrastructure, providing significant amounts of computers and networking hardware and software from the likes of Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, and Oracle. Many outstanding ICT case studies and examples abound, but most rely on the Internet in whole or in part (Trucano, 2010). One of the great challenges in the developing world is finding sustainable methods for improving teacher training where Internet and electricity are not a given. Some of the ways these obstacles have been overcome in developing countries are discussed in this chapter.

TI Paving the way for the introduction of new vaccines into developing

SO EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES
AB The great advances in vaccine R&D over the last 20 years have not been paralleled by the regular introduction of new vaccines into the market thus far. This situation acquires more dramatic proportions in developing countries, where preventable infectious diseases still impose a major public health problem. Furthermore, most of the now developments are being conceived to target the market of industrialized countries and it is foreseeable that their introduction in low-to-middle income countries will be difficult if at any time possible. Strengthening their own capacities for R&D and production is likely to be the most reasonable avenue to ensure that new vaccines will become a sustainable reality for developing countries. Concerted efforts that draw together local capacities (industry and academy) with the experience of large global manufacturers, could have a major impact and provide a great example of an effective partnership to achieve this.

AB In bulk of the developing countries, the consumption of commercial energy has increased rather rapidly, though a few of them still continue to derive their main energy needs for subsistence from the traditional fuels. This paper presents the patterns of energy consumption in developing countries (a group of about 130 countries) and the developed countries (about 27) illustrating the regional differences. A quantitative study of demographic and economic parameters show. increasing income levels in terms of People's Purchasing Power (PPP) and also an increasing energy intensity causing serious environmental disorders in many developing countries. China, India, Korea and Mexico are amongst the world's top twelve carbon emitters along with the top economies of the world. These countries at the same time show very different urban and rural energy consumption patterns. Estimates in any case show a definite decline in traditional energy use and increasing dependence on fossil fuels. Case of India has been taken as an illustration. Any global effort therefore for sustainable energy development has to consider the developments in the developing countries. Various options for decreasing energy consumption and reducing environmental pollution have been discussed with cost estimates. The paper generates arguments about increasing international cooperation for energy supply in the developing countries.

TI Role of informal sector recycling in waste management in developing
   countries
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Many thousands of people in developing country cities depend on recycling materials from waste for their livelihoods. With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, and of waste strategies on improving recycling rates, one of the major challenges in solid waste management in developing countries is how best to work with this informal sector to improve their livelihoods, working conditions and efficiency in recycling.
   The general characteristics of informal recycling are reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Despite the health and social problems associated with informal recycling, it provides significant economic benefits that need to be retained. Experience shows that it can be highly counterproductive to establish new formal waste recycling systems without taking into account informal systems that already exist. The preferred option is to integrate the informal sector into waste management planning, building on their practices and experience, while working to improve efficiency and the living and working conditions of those involved. Issues associated with integrating informal recycling into the formal waste management sector are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Technology Transfer at the WTO: Old Promises and New Hopes of the
   Developing World
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB While the subject of forced technology transfer has elicited sharp focus in recent years, similar attention has not been directed to the issue of voluntary technology transfer under the aegis of the WTO. Technology transfer was seen as a tool to enable development by both developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement entrenched technology transfer to LDCs as a hard obligation for developed countries, but its imperfect implementation has caused concerns to LDCs. Developing countries, such as India, are not beneficiaries under Article 66.2, but they have pushed for a closer link between technology transfer and development issues through a variety of ways at the WTO. Due to COVID-19, the issue of technology transfer concerning health in the LDCs becomes more important. Against this background, this article analyses the experience of LDCs with the implementation of Article 66.2 and India's experience in its push for further entrenchment of technology transfer obligations. This article specifically assess technology transfer by the US and the EU in light of COVID-19 vis-a-vis Article 66.2. The paper pays particular attention to the various roadblocks in the implementation of Article 66.2 and the solutions as proposed by LDCs themselves.

AB The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN) gathered leaders in immunization programs, vaccine manufacturing, representatives of the Argentinean Health Authorities and Pan American Health Organization, among other global health stakeholders, for its 17th Annual General Meeting in Buenos Aires, to reflect on how vaccines are shaping global health. Polio eradication and elimination of measles and rubella from the Americas is a result of successful collaboration, made possible by timely supply of affordable vaccines. After decades of intense competition for high-value markets, collaboration with developing countries has become critical, and involvement of multiple manufacturers as well as public- and private-sector investments are essential, for developing new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The recent Zika virus outbreak and the accelerated Ebola vaccine development exemplify the need for international partnerships to combat infectious diseases. A new player, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has made its entrance in the global health community, aiming to stimulate research preparedness against emerging infections. Face-to-face panel discussions facilitated the dialogue around challenges, such as risks of viability to vaccine development and regulatory convergence, to improve access to sustainable vaccine supply. It was discussed that joint efforts to optimizing regulatory pathways in developing countries, reducing registration time by up to 50%, are required. Outbreaks of emerging infections and the global Polio eradication and containment challenges are reminders of the importance of vaccines' access, and of the importance of new public private partnerships.

TI Flood risk mitigation in developing countries: deriving accurate
   topographic data for remote areas under severe time and economic
   constraints
SO JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Isla Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, has repeatedly witnessed catastrophic disasters that caused dramatic economic losses and killed thousands of people over the last decades. One striking example is the disastrous flood event that hit the transnational basin of River Soliette on 24 May 2004. The event resulted from a severe tropical storm and killed over 1000 Haitian and 400 Dominican people. In the context of an International Cooperation Initiative, the University of Bologna led several activities in the fields of flood risk assessment, management and mitigation, and sustainable development planning for the Soliette river basin. This paper presents new techniques for a timely assessment of flood risk in data-scarce and remote areas in developing countries showing in particular: (1) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based topographic survey of the Soliette riverbed, carried out under urgent temporal, logistical and technical constraints, and (2) some possible utilisations of the collected topographic data for the identification of structural and non-structural flood risk mitigation measures. The analysis enabled us to set and test a GNSS-based technique for fast, reliable and detailed topographic surveys in remote regions, which represents a valid option for similar areas with limited accessibility in emerging and developing countries.

TI Sustainability along the global supply chain: the case of Vietnam
SO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact that more sustainable sourcing policies by many multinational companies are having on the suppliers located in developing countries such as Vietnam. Questions are raised about the process through which CSR is reaching the country.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in Vietnam thanks to the support of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization's (UNIDO) Regional Office. The survey was carried out on the basis of a questionnaire that was used as a support during the direct interviews and was sent electronically when the preferred method of on-site visits was not possible. A total of 25 Vietnamese enterprises were involved in the research.
   Findings - The results achieved highlight, on the one hand, how CSR does make business sense even in a developing country such as Vietnam and, on the other, the difficulties related to the way requirements of sustainability are moving from Northern consumers to suppliers in Vietnam.
   Practical implications - This process calls for new forms of collaboration involving firms along the supply chain, local authorities, international players, and civil society.
   Originality/value - The paper points out the unsustainability of the process through which corporate responsibility is being imposed on Vietnamese suppliers and how CSR, having become a mandatory requirement for access to international markets, might transformitself into a new type of technical barrier to trade. Therefore, CSR needs to be fostered rather than imposed, through the creation of innovative partnerships and locally-rooted solutions.

TI Private Sector and Waste Management in Delhi: A Political Economy
   Perspective
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Due to their size and rapid growth, large cities in developing countries are increasingly challenged by burgeoning waste generation. Waste management, however, has traditionally provided employment opportunities to the many urban poor in the informal sector. These traditional models, working largely in parallel with state-led interventions, are under pressure because they fail to address the waste management crisis. This failure, coupled with the lack of capacities of local governments, has paved the way for formal private sector participation. We examine the case of Delhi where a complex interplay of competing approaches have accompanied efforts of urban local bodies, civil society and the private sector (informal and formal) at finding a sustainable working solution. Our analysis of the complex relationship within the private sector players, and between private and public actors, provides novel insights into potential contribution of public-private partnerships for effective waste management in developing countries.

This paper describes how actions to enhance optimal infant and young child nutrition can be linked with child development interventions for children under 3 years of age. In countries with high rates of malnutrition, linking these two components will result in synergies of program activities, and will bring about a greater impact at reduced cost than either activity conducted separately New understanding of social marketing and communication strategies can increase effectiveness of linked interventions. Public-private partnerships to improve both child development and nutrition offer promise for sustainable interventions.

TI What Should Be Considered when Developing ICT-Integrated Classroom
   Models for a Developing Country?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study aims to identify factors to be considered when developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-integrated classroom models and to suggest a conceptual framework for considering more appropriate classroom models, tailored to the environments and needs of each developing country. In-depth interviews were conducted with experts, yielding many factors to be taken into account when integrating ICT in various educational contexts of developing countries. The factors are categorized into five domains: current status and relevant policies in ICT education, ODA (Official Development Assistance) goals and priority setting, infrastructure and technical challenges, pedagogical methods, and educational resources. Based on the recommendations elicited for the five categories, we suggest a conceptual framework that provides practical guidance on the criteria for selecting classroom models suited to each partner country's environments and contexts. This study also draws implications from the interviews for classroom design guidelines related to hardware and infrastructure, to improve the sustainability of ICT-integrated classroom projects.

TI A framework for sustainable and integrated municipal solid waste
   management: Barriers and critical factors to developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Developing countries adopt policies to reduce the negative impacts of large amount of waste generated by accelerated industrialization and rapid urbanization, but these actions are far from establishing procedures that meet society's needs, especially regarding the management of municipal solid waste (MSW), which requires the cooperation of numerous stakeholders, and a broad plan of action, in terms of sustainability cities' targets and policies. In this sense, sustainable and integrated solid waste management (S-ISWM) emerges as a solution to address the growing challenges of disposing of MSW in developing countries municipalities. However, to guide SISWM implementation there still a need of a framework with a multi-stakeholder and holistic perspective of the MSW management, considering the barriers and critical success factors (CSFs) to achieve it. To this end, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA diagram on the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and then, a content analysis of 75 articles, which met the eligibility criteria, were carried out. As a result, were identified eight barriers, 11 CSFs, which were grouped according to five pillars - public policies, disposal techniques, legal aspects, public-private partnership (PPP) and energy recovery - that affect the municipal S-ISWM and were pointed out ways of implementing these factors in practice. Finally, it was proposed a management artifact - a framework towards S-ISWM - based on state-of-the-art CSFs and barriers, mainly oriented to waste to energy, to the developing countries municipalities. This study offers theoretical, practical, and political implications, serving as a stimulus for the development of public policies with a multidisciplinary approach, providing environmental, economic, and societal contributions, and, thus, encouraging the achievement of the eleventh and the twelfth sustainable development goals.

AB Developing countries face challenges in meeting requirements of importers and regulators due to inadequate resources in conformity assessments. Laboratories in developing countries fail to participate in proficiency testing (PT) schemes from abroad due to unaffordable cost. In the southern and eastern African regions, with support from German metrology institute, PTB, PT schemes for water, wheat flour, edible salt and edible vegetable oil have been installed to support regional laboratories in their competence improvement. There have been great achievements in terms of knowledge exchange, capacity building and skills improvement. Development projects are always short- or midterm projects. So currently, the schemes face sustainability challenge as external support is ending, and the standard deviation of participants' results are still high. To overcome these challenges, technical support from another development partner would be a short-term solution, but on the long term, financial support from the governments in the regions is required as the permanent solution.

TI World Federation of Haemophilia programs in developing countries
SO SEMINARS IN THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS
AB The World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) is a global not-for-profit organization devoted to furthering the treatment of hemophilia and related disorders. Founded in Montreal in 1963, it has grown tremendously during the last 40 years and now has 107 National Member Organizations and has been recognized by the World Health Organization. The mission of the WFH is to introduce, improve, and maintain care for patients with hemophilia and related disorders. Several specific programs may be used as tools to achieve these goals. The WFH organizes regular educational workshops on key aspects of hemophilia care. Fellowships are offered to approximately 30 healthcare professionals each year that provide funding for a period of study of up to 8 weeks at an lnternational Hemophilia Training Center of their choice. The WFH twinning program helps emerging hemophilia treatment centers develop partnerships with well-established centers. Although the ultimate goal of the WFH is to promote sustainable hemophilia treatment in developing countries, donations of concentrate are regularly made through the Humanitarian Aid program. The WHF launched the Global Alliance for Progress in its 40th anniversary year, establishing a partnership between the WFH and other stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. The aim is to focus on 30 to 40 developing countries during the next 10 years, aiming to more than double the number of patients diagnosed with hemophilia in those countries. The WFH is also involved in fostering discussion on key issues such as safety and supply of blood products.

TI Smart City Governance in Developing Countries: A Systematic Literature
   Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Smart cities that make broad use of digital technologies have been touted as possible solutions for the population pressures faced by many cities in developing countries and may help meet the rising demand for services and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the high financial cost involved in infrastructure maintenance, the substantial size of the informal economies, and various governance challenges are curtailing government idealism regarding smart cities. This review examines the state of smart city development in developing countries, which includes understanding the conceptualisations, motivations, and unique drivers behind (and barriers to) smarty city development. A total of 56 studies were identified from a systematic literature review from an initial pool of 3928 social sciences literature identified from two academic databases. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis and thematic analysis. The review found that technology-enabled smart cities in developing countries can only be realised when concurrent socioeconomic, human, legal, and regulatory reforms are instituted. Governments need to step up their efforts to fulfil the basic infrastructure needs of citizens, raise more revenue, construct clear regulatory frameworks to mitigate the technological risks involved, develop human capital, ensure digital inclusivity, and promote environmental sustainability. A supportive ecosystem that encourages citizen participation, nurtures start-ups, and promotes public-private partnerships needs to be created to realise their smart city vision.

In this paper a model of structural equations is proposed to analyze the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility actions and its influence on Cooperation, Innovation and Performance in the Costa Rican agribusiness sector. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the conceptual relationship model and explain the associations among variables. The model results suggest that CSR and Innovation positively influence the agribusiness Performance. On the contrary, it seems that Cooperation does not have an influence on such Performance.

TI Factors Related to Retention of Postgraduate Trainees in
   Obstetrics-Gynecology at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB Purpose The retention of health care workers in developing countries is a key component to reducing the current health care workforce crisis. The availability of postgraduate medical training in developing countries could be an appropriate adjunctive solution. The authors investigated factors that led obstetrics-gynecology (ob/gyn) residents at a university-based academic training program at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (Accra, Ghana) to stay in Ghana for training and explored why the residents expect to stay in (or leave) Ghana after training.
   Method In July 2006, the authors surveyed 20 residents and conducted semistructured interviews with a subset of 9 residents.
   Results Nineteen respondents (95%) reported they would have left Ghana if postgraduate training had not been available, 16 (80%) reported that becoming an ob/gyn specialist was important to them, 15 (75%) indicated that the program trained them to practice in Ghana, and 17 (85%) were certain they would stay in Ghana after completing the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data supported the idea that three factors contribute to the retention of ob/gyn physicians in Ghana: (1) the presence of a postgraduate training program in Ghana, (2) residents' commitment to serve the people of Ghana, and (3) residents' feelings that physicians can "make it" economically in Ghana.
   Conclusions Postgraduate training is an important contributor to the retention of physicians in country. Partnerships between academic health centers in developed and developing countries provide opportunities to address the global health care crisis in a significant and sustainable way.

TI Emergency medical services in Islamabad, Pakistan: a public-private
   partnership
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the emergency medical services (EMS) based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Rescue-15 is an innovative EMS collaboration project between the police, the private sector and the community.
   Methods: Data from Rescue-15 were used for systems analysis. The institutional setup, private-public partnership, client satisfaction and sustainability issues were examined. The access and efficiency of EMS were assessed in terms of ambulance response time.
   Results: Primarily, systems analysis showed community participation to explain the project's strength. Since its establishment, the project has been meeting its own recurrent expenditures without levying an extra burden on the Government. Sustainability issues such as amendments to legislation have been addressed at departmental and governmental levels. Data analysis showed that rescue time is, on average, 10.4 min (SD=2.6 min). A client survey also demonstrated user satisfaction and increased confidence in the service.
   Conclusions: This EMS programme exemplifies the potential of public-private partnership involving the police and the private sector in project implementation and management in a developing country with scarce resources. This initiative to involve the public and the private sector may provide a model for implementation of such services in other resource-poor developing countries, which may in turn facilitate realistic solutions for better prehospital care in developing countries.

AB In many developing countries, the production and trade in agricultural products plays a crucial role for economic growth and development. It enables countries to cam foreign exchange, to create employment and to invest in sustainable utilization of resources. However, developing countries are often faced with a number of constraints that limit local farmers to develop. First of all, the agricultural sector often remains underdeveloped as a result of inadequate and unbalanced investments compared to the industrial sector. At the same time, farmers have insufficient access to market information and (as a result) have poor bargaining power. Most farmers own small plots of land, and as a result are unable to invest in meeting the stringent international standards to which they need comply. Finally, it is felt that, also at WTO level, trade rules favour multinationals and the developed countries, and not small farmers in developing countries. For these farmers to participate in international trade, KENFAP identified three strategies. The first is to build institutional capacity and self-organization; these will enable farmers to be better informed, improve bargaining power and learn from international best practices. The development of partnerships and networks will further contribute to preparing for market access. Finally it recommends the active support through enabling incentives (policies and regulations) from national and international policymakers.

TI The irony of choice in the "New Development Financing Landscape"
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB The so-called "New Development Financing Landscape" has heralded claims of an "Age of Choice" for developing countries. Here, more diverse sources of development finance have undercut the monopoly of influence held by "traditional" donors: opening up greater "choice" or "policy space" for developing countries. This narrative, we argue, is a fiction. Instead, the field is characterised by scarcity, not abundance. Further, Northern and (re)emerging Southern donors have tended toward convergence; reducing the scope for recipients to play these actors off one another while restricting recipient agency to properly shape and direct agendas. These trends compel recipient states to compete for scarce public and skittish private finance in a (de)regulatory race to the bottom where they must either reform in a manner conducive to the exigencies of global capital or be "left behind"; the anathema of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

AB From sustainable development (SD) through green growth to sustainable development plus (SD+)! Does the '+' really matter? This is the question that brings life to this article and the answer is: YES, it does. The '+' makes a huge difference especially for developing countries such as those from Africa that for a long time have not been fully brought on board in shaping global discourses and the preferred future global development agenda. This article argues that the time has come for globally privileged countries of the North to realise that operationalising ` The Future We Want' after Rio+ 20 demands that developing countries be accorded unpolluted space to contribute to providing answers to difficult and elusive questions on the unsustainable ways of the past development paradigms. Among such questions are: When will the issue of resource intensive development and overconsumption be finally answered? Can green growth transition be part of the solution? How will a post 2015 framework best address the needs of developing countries? The conclusion is that SD+ signals a deeper, wider and knowledge-based understanding of global (un) sustainable perspectives that result in global citizens understanding The Future We Do Not Want.

To maximize the potential of this phenomenon for global health, countries and donors need to link two disparate schools of thought: (1) a search for technological solutions exemplified by global public-private product development partnerships, and (2) a focus on systemic solutions exemplified by health policy and systems research. A strong capacity for both technological and social innovation in developing countries represents the only truly sustainable means of improving the effectiveness of health systems. Local public-private research and development partnerships, implementation research, and individual leadership are needed to achieve this goal.

In developing countries degraded environments threaten the survival of rural households. Developing countries have been launching, in partnership with rural people, a wide variety of development programs to improve these degraded and depleted environments. The paper examines women's participation in community forestry programs and factors that contribute to their participation in reforestation programs. The paper, drawing from several case studies conducted in Nepal, discusses factors hindering the involvement of rural poor in these programs: barriers rooted in the fear of exploitation and inaccessibility of resources. It then outlines how social workers can advocate for the participation of the poor to promote sustainable development.

Such collaboration in occupational health and safety is encouraged in the development of infrastructure in research empowerment and capacity building. This action includes the setting of priorities, the identification and documentation of problems, sponsorship, data bases and surveillance systems, technical support, methodology, publishing, research and training programs, controlled intervention, information exchange, and networking. Examples of priorities in occupational health and safety in the developing world include the informal sector (informally hired and independent workers), temporary work, pesticides, accidents, dusts, carcinogens, solvents, ergonomics, women and child labor, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiencey syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and transfer of hazardous materials and technologies. The sustainability of occupational health and safety structures and functions in the developing countries is a primary concern. Socioethical principles emphasize local, national, mutual and global gains. Examples of collaboration are given. Pervasive problems and strategies toward their solution are highlighted.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Climate change is a core issue for sustainable development and exacerbates inequality. However, in both the WTO and the climate regime, disagreements over differential treatment have hampered efforts to address international inequalities in a way that facilitates effective responses to global issues. Sustainable globalization requires bridging the disparities between developed and developing countries in their capacities to address such matters of global concern. However, differential treatment now functions as a distraction from the global issues it was supposed to address. Cognitive biases distort perceptions regarding the climate crisis and the value of multilateralism. To what extent can cognitive science inform decision making by States? How do we change paradigms (cognitive background assumptions), which limit the options that decision-making elites in developed and developing countries perceive as useful and worth considering? To what extent do cognitive biases and cultural cognition create a barrier to multilateral cooperation on issues of global concern?

SO SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS
SE Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series
AB Accelerated growing population and migration to urban areas in developing countries have resulted in a vital need for the establishment of protected source water and modern, well-maintained drinking-water treatment plants to disseminate potable water to residents. While the challenge in the developed world is mainly to prevent existing infrastructure from decay and to initiate a transition from the disposal-oriented regimes toward more sustainable approaches with a focus on reuse options, the situation is more complex in developing countries. Developing countries suffer from economic problems and are often struggling with insufficient infrastructure and low water supply and sanitation coverage, particularly in rapidly growing urban slum settlements, with significant consequences, especially regarding public health. In this chapter, we discuss the urban water cycle and water consumption, the challenges facing urban water management in developing countries including climate change, the concept of integrated water resources management, and the framework for integrated urban water management in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including the salient socioeconomic and environmental stresses and trends that will drive and condition water supply and demands over the coming decades. It is concluded that approaches for advanced international and intersectoral cooperation and for identifying and strengthening intellectual and technical resources, tools, lessons, and best practices should be shared, applied, or adapted across the region. Finally, recommendations are made for improved management of water resources in MENA countries.

   conditions
SO JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
AB Environmental monitoring, as a prerequisite for environmental risk assessment, is crucial in developing nations from Africa, Latin America, South East Asia, or Melanesia, where conspicuously most of the World's mining activity concentrates. One of the most important environmental problems relates to the disposal of mine concentrates to river systems (e.g., Irian Jaya or Papua New Guinea). However, environmental monitoring is severely restricted in developing countries due to the chronic lack of funds. This paper explores the potential for a wider use of Field Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy instruments (FPXRFs) in fast, real-time, cost-effective environmental surveys for heavy metal dispersal in developing countries, where access to fully equipped geochemical labs is not usually a viable option. We simulated a scenario resembling conditions to be found in a remote region affected by mining-derived metal pollution where no proper laboratory facilities existed. We used an OXFORD X-MET 3000TX XRF analyzer under quasi-realistic conditions, relying solely on the instrument to allow geochemical characterization of a highly polluted Pb-Zn old mining district in the Alcudian Valley of central Spain. Our results for Pb, Zn, Cu, As, and Cd from 12 mine sites showed an excellent performance of the instrument, both under real-time and laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the instrument proved to be fit to endure a variety of field operational conditions and was able to deal with different types of samples, including tailings, soils, and stream sediments. Thus, taking into account the affordability of FPXRFs in relation to bench-top laboratory metal analyzers and their operational simplicity, we suggest that these portable instruments should become 'the equipment of choice' for environmental monitoring in developing countries. In this respect, FPXRFs satisfy the system-independence criterion for sustainable development, i.e., the instrument can stand alone and do its job with few or no other supporting facilities or devices. We go further on these matters providing some hints on how FPXRFs could become widely available via international cooperation, and the technical and social benefits that such equipments could bring to foreign aid recipient countries.

TI International Health Links movement expands in the United Kingdom
SO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB The need to strengthen health capacity in developing countries is widely documented. The World Health Organization has called for an increase in the number of health workers in all countries experiencing critical shortages, a significant scaling-up of training and more efficient use of existing health workers. Health Links, long-term mutually beneficial partnerships between UK health institutions and their counterparts in developing countries, are helping to fill these gaps. Links allow for the reciprocal transfer of knowledge and skills between partners, enabling the Uks expertise in health service delivery and training to be channelled towards the needs of those in developing countries, while also bringing a wide range of benefits to the UK. Examples of Health Links in Ethiopia demonstrate such benefits. An increasingly supportive policy environment is enabling a significant expansion in the number of Links. However, the quality of these Links is critical to their impact and thus there is a need both to continue to support those engaging in Links to develop sustainable, mutually beneficial strategic partnerships, and to strengthen the body of evidence of their impacts.

TI Planning, implementing and managing CD-ROM services in developing
   countries
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB This paper discusses some issues and challenges which library information systems in developing countries have faced in planning, implementing and managing CD-ROM services. It focuses on the measures taken to solve these challenges in terms of planning, funding, hardware, software, database selection, installation, staff and user training, publicity: use policies and procedures, document non-availability and evaluation. The paper concludes that the implementation of CD-ROM in developing countries will continue growing, and that users will increasingly become more sophisticated and will keep demanding better CD-ROM resources and services. In order to cope with these demands, institutions involved in implementing CD-ROM services will continue pursuing the current trend of adopting resourceful, creative and innovative approaches in tackling the challenges posed by the implementation of CD-ROM. Finally the paper recommends, among other things, that it is crucial to develop a new vision based on a thorough needs assessment to guide library information systems in planning, implementing and developing user-oriented CD-ROM. It is also strongly recommended that a partnership approach between library information systems and relevant departments (like information technology departments), funding organisations, CD-ROM publishers and vendors is crucial for developing sustainable CD-ROM services.

AB In the more developed countries, genetically engineered crops contribute greatly to agricultural productivity and sustainability. Over the last few years, the largest growth in the adoption of genetically engineered crops has been in developing countries and this trend is expected to continue. The multinational life sciences companies have been leading the way, but they are focusing primarily on a few crop/trait combinations that have high commercial value and occupy large international markets. Because of the costs and complexity of the issues related to crop biotechnology, many crops and traits of importance to subsistence and resource poor farmers around the world have been overlooked. The Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project (ABSPII), a Cornell University-led and USAID funded consortium of public and private sector institutions, provides support for scientists, regulators, extension workers, farmers and the general public in developing countries to make informed decisions about agricultural biotechnology. When possible, ABSPII creates public-private partnerships to help leverage public funds to help absorb development costs and provide broader distribution channels. Since 2005, ABSPII has been working with the National Agricultural Research Organization in Uganda to establish safe and cost effective programs for the development and commercialization of East African highland bananas (Musa spp.), genetically engineered for black sigatoka and nematode resistance. This paper gives a brief description of the work that has been done to date and discuss the ABSPII based strategy that has been adopted to develop and deliver genetically engineered crops for developing countries.

SO FOOD SECURITY
AB This paper provides an overview of Gulf investments in foreign farmland, mainly in developing countries, and the motivation behind these investments. The literature suggests that private entities in Gulf countries are engaging in these investments for portfolio diversification, while Gulf governments are investing to ensure food security challenges resulting from the limited agricultural resources of these countries. The paper also discusses examples of farmland investments in Sudan, Indonesia and Pakistan, and their consequences. The main recommendation is the need to ensure that these investments provide positive externalities to the host countries and local communities involved, in order to ensure the continuity and acceptability of these investments.

TI The Effect of Exchange Rate Volatility on International Trade and
   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Developing Countries along "One Belt
   and One Road"
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB The "One Belt and One Road" (OBOR) project was started by the Chinese government with the aim of achieving sustainable economic development and increasing cooperation with other countries. This project has five major objectives, which include (i) increasing trade flow, (ii) encouraging policy coordination, (iii) improving connectivity, (iv) obtaining financial integration, and (v) fortifying closeness between people. This paper aims to analyze the effect of exchange rate volatility on international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries along "One Belt and One Road". We selected seven developing countries which are part of this project, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. We collected panel data for the period 1995 to 2016 from the U.S. Heritage Foundation, International Financial Statistics (IFS) (a database developed by the International Monetary Fund), and World Development Indicators (WDI) (a database developed by the World Bank). We applied Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) and threshold-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (TGARCH) (1,1) models to measure the exchange rate volatility. Furthermore, we employed a fixed effect model to analyze the relationship of exchange rate volatility with international trade and FDI. The results of this paper revealed that exchange rate volatility affects both international trade and FDI significantly but negatively in OBOR-related countries, which correlates with the economic theory arguing that exchange rate volatility may hurt international trade and FDI. It can be concluded that exchange rate volatility can adversely affect international trade and FDI inflows in OBOR-related countries.

TI Strategic issues in preventing cataract blindness in developing
   countries
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Cataract blindness is a public health problem of major proportions in developing countries. intracapsular cataract extraction with aphakic spectacles has been the standard surgical technique for restoring sight. Because of image magnification in the operated eye, however, the result in unilaterally blind patients is less than satisfactory. Fortunately, with the availability of low-cost intraocular lenses (IOL) and ophthalmologists trained in extracapsular surgery, it is now practical to intervene successfully in the unilateral case.
   The need for increased attention on the quality of the visual outcome is only one of three important strategic issues in cataract blindness control. The existing high prevalence of cataract blindness in developing countries and an increasing cataract incidence due to an aging population require substantial increases in surgical volume. The third issue relates to cost. If significant increases in surgical volume and quality of outcomes are to be realized without an increased need for external funding, service delivery must be made more efficient. The expansion of IOL surgery for unilateral blindness is a favourable trend in ensuring financial sustainability of delivery systems; patients can be operated on while still economically productive and able to pay rather than waiting for bilateral blindness and a less favourable economic and social impact. If the quality, volume, and cost issues are to be successfully addressed, operational and structural changes to eye care delivery systems are necessary. These changes can be effected through training technology introduction, management of facilities, social marketing, organizational partnerships, and evaluation. With improved understanding of the critical factors in successful models their widespread replication will be facilitated.

TI How does global trade in environmental goods contribute to the SDGs in
   developing countries?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Global trade in environmental goods (EGs) has provided a new vision for international cooperation in response to sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, there are ongoing debates over whether developing countries can achieve sustainability during their trade participation. This study proposes a conceptual framework to observe countries' current trade status and potential for benefit from global EG trade. By tracing the changing status of 142 countries in the conceptual framework during 2001-2019, this study finds that global EG trade reduces inequality among developed countries while it increases inequality among developing countries. Some emerging market countries may enhance their status in the global trade network, but their upgrading within the global value chain remains slow. The current poor EG trade state and limited benefit potential of most developing countries will have a non-significant impact in terms of achieving the SDGs. The study suggests that regional trade will give developing countries a better chance to integrate into trade markets and support them toward achieving the SDGs.

TI Genetically modified crops: Risks and promise
SO CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
AB GM foods have the potential to provide significant benefits for developing countries. Over 800 million people are chronically undernourished, and 180 million children are severely underweight for their age. By 2020, there will be an extra billion mouths to feed. Ecological approaches that underpin sustainable agriculture (e.g., integrated pest management) and participatory approaches that strengthen farmers' own experimentation and decision making are key. Biotechnology will be an essential partner, if yield ceilings are to be raised, if crops are to be grown without excessive reliance on pesticides, and if farmers on less favored lands are to be provided with crops that are resistant to drought and salinity, and that can use nitrogen and other nutrients more efficiently.
   Over the past 10 years, in addition supporting ecological approaches, the Rockefeller Foundation has funded the training of some 400 developing-country scientists in the techniques of biotechnology. Most of the new crop varieties are the result of tissue culture and marker-aided selection. The Foundation also supports the production of genetically engineered rices, including a new rice engineered for beta carotene (the precursor of Vitamin A) in the grain.
   Some specific steps can be taken by Monsanto that would improve acceptance of plant biotechnology in both the developing and the industrialized worlds: label; disavow gene protection (terminator) systems; phase out the use of antibiotic resistance markers; agree (with big seed companies) to use the plant variety protection rather than patents, in developing countries; establish an independently administered fellowship program to train developing-country scientists in crop biotechnology, biosafety, and intellectual property; donate useful technologies to developing countries; agree to share financial rewards from intellectual property rights on varieties such as basmati or jasmine rice with the countries of origin; and finally, develop a global public dialogue that treats developing-country participants as equal partners.

SO CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB An examination into the incidence of child labour in developing countries will require an analysis of the reasons for its occurrence, which in turn will go a long way in indicating a possible route towards providing a solution. This article will clarify why child labour rather than child work in general is an issue for concern, submitting that it is the type of work that impedes the education and development of children that needs to be addressed. A distinction between the two prevailing motivations behind calls for developing countries to address child labour will be drawn, and the article will pursue that only the human rights motivation will provide the requisite cooperation and commitment in attaining sustainable and effective elimination of child labour. In analysing statistics that child labour occurs predominantly in developing countries, the article will reflect on current global trends to submit that child labour in developing countries can have a global impact. Considering the various reasons that have been attributed to cause child labour in developing countries, it will be demonstrated that poverty is a common element in all such attributes. In discussing the possible solutions, the article will submit that developing countries with child labour problems do not have the resources for the necessary intervention to tackle a problem of such magnitude and, therefore, international effort is necessary. Discussions on the international forum to coordinate these efforts will establish that a forum free of trade links is needed, thereby dispelling suggestions that the World Trade Organisation and sanctions-based approach is the best solution. The article will conclude that work should be undertaken building on International Labour Organisation standards, if such standards are beneficial to child development. The problem may lie in developing countries, but only global efforts can offer a solution.

TI Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): The Role of Government in
   promoting CSR
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB This paper examines corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the role government can play in promoting CSR. Corporations are an integral part of the large economy of any given society or country whereby these corporations operate. The government's role is critical in promoting CSR activities or agendas because CSR is voluntary without mandatory legislation. The method used in this paper is a normative literature review and secondary data procedures. The research results show the need for developed and developing countries to share CSR's best practices and build human institutions capable of enhancing CSR agendas by creating awareness, soft laws, partnering, and mandating business enterprises to be transparent in solving society's problems wherever they operate. Governments in some developed nations have taken a far-reaching agenda in promoting CSR, especially the UK, European Union, the USA, and other developing countries in East Asia. However, developing countries are lagging behind in developing CSR agendas but should not simply copy from developed countries but adopt CSR's agenda susceptive to their multiple nations' sustainable and equitable developments. The result also shows that the lack of good governance and transparency in abundant natural resources in developing countries in the south has led to corrupt elites diverting CSR activities funds for their self-interest and not their local communities. Some developing countries still see CSR as an act of philanthropy, not as means for sustainable and equitable development for economic growth, hence the lack of transparency surrounding CSR by the various government and their elites.

TI A cross-sectional review: Impacts and sustainability of small-scale
   renewable energy projects in developing countries
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Access to sustainable and affordable energy services is a crucial factor in reducing poverty in developing countries. In particular, small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects are recognized as important forms of development assistance for reaching the energy poor. However, to date only a few empirical evaluations exist which analyze and compare the impact of these projects on local living conditions and their sustainability ex-post implementation.
   To better understand the impacts and the conditions that influence sustainability of these projects, the research presented in this paper evaluated 23 local development projects post implementation. By applying an standardized evaluation design to a cross-sectional sample in terms of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, biomass, hydro), user needs (electricity, food preparation, lighting, productive uses), community management models, finance mechanisms and geographical locations, the review results provide valuable insights on the underlying conditions that influence the success or failure of these small-scale local energy interventions. The empirical evidence suggests that the sustainability of small-scale energy implementations (<= 100 kW) in developing countries is determined by the same factors, independent of the socio-cultural, political and ecological context. These findings allow to better predict the long-term success of small sustainable energy projects in developing countries, this can help to improve project designs and increase the certainty for future investment decisions.

TI Trade-based adoption of voluntary environmental programs in the
   developing world: Racing to the top or stuck in the mud?
SO POLICY SCIENCES
AB Scholars have consistently found that firms in developing countries adopt voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) in high numbers when their major trade partners are home to many VEP-certified firms. This reflects the following dynamic: Importers based in countries with many VEP-certified facilities demand similarly sustainable production processes from trade partners, and so exporting firms in partner countries adopt VEPs to signal their sustainable practices. Studies have identified characteristics of developing countries that make local exporting firms more likely to adopt VEPs as a signal; however, there has been little analysis as to the country-level characteristics that make importers more (or less) likely to demand VEPs from suppliers abroad, beyond having many VEP-certified firms themselves. This study considers this matter, theorizing that VEP diffusion only accompanies exporting to countries with high levels of income and education, as well as a high number of VEP-certified firms. Panel data analysis provides support for the theory, showing that developing countries only experience trade-based diffusion of ISO 14001 (a widely adopted VEP) through their exports to countries with high income and/or education levels. In contrast, exporting to countries that lack these characteristics creates no such diffusion, even where importing countries' VEP certification levels are high. Instead, such trade produces a stuck in the mud effect, as developing countries' certification levels stagnate even as those of their import partners rise.

TI A strategic framework for sustainable construction in developing

SO CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB There is no doubt that large-scale development in the built environment and its physical infrastructure is needed in the so-called 'developing countries'. However, these problems need to be addressed in a way that is socially and ecologically responsible. There is great urgency to make sustainable interventions now, while these built environments are being created, rather than try and change things after the fact. However, there are a number of challenges to the introduction of sustainable construction technologies and practices, and certain enablers need to be developed to help these countries adopt a more sustainable path. The Agenda 21 for Sustainable Construction in Developing Countries suggested a strategy for addressing some of these challenges by developing a Research and Development Agenda, based on a matrix of immediate, medium-term and longterm technological, institutional and value enablers. This Agenda is supported by a Stakeholder Plan for Action. The challenge now is to find the means to implement these suggestions at a local level by developing regional and national action plans.

TI 'Culture for development' and the ESCO policy on the protection of
   cultural property during armed conflict
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY
AB UNESCO increasingly points to the value of culture for sustainable development. However, if we review UNESCO policies on the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict, developing countries do not seem to find access or implement them. Consequently, this paper analyses UNESCO initiatives related to the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict from a developmental perspective and explores whether they are adequate and inclusive for developing countries. Data for this paper were gathered from document analyses and additional expert interviews obtained via email questionnaires. The paper finds that UNESCO tends to be willing to improve the situation. However, the ratification rates of the relevant UNESCO Conventions in developing countries remain low, the implementation of these instruments is almost non-existent and the commitment to UNESCO protection policies is insufficient. This is mainly due to a lack of awareness and to the fact that the initiative has to come from the state concerned; the possibilities for international cooperation are still quite limited.

TI Exploring the Effectiveness of Community Home-Based Care (CHBC) Programs
   in Africa with Examples from Some African Countries
SO STUDIES ON ETHNO-MEDICINE
AB Incontrovertibly, CHBC programs in developing parts of the world can be a panacea if their efficiency and effectiveness are enhanced or strengthened. The aim of this paper is to raise debates and discourses on the effectiveness of CHBC programs in some developing countries. The paper has relied on a review of literature methodology. Findings indicate that CHBC are generally made ineffective by: inadequate public support, inadequate government support, lack of human and materials resources, and lack of financial resources. The following have been suggested to bolster CHBC programs: increase public awareness and support, fostering a strong government-NGO partnership, mobilizing local funding, mobilizing adequate human and material resources, and adopting various ways of strengthening the effectiveness of the programs. The paper has theoretically been premised on the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA).

TI Interrogating Climate Adaptation Financing in Zimbabwe: Proposed
   Direction
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing the long-term coping capacities of rural or urban settlements to negative climate change impacts have become urgent issues in developing countries. Developing countries do not have the means to cope with climate hazards and their economies are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and coastal zones. Like most countries in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe suffers from climate-induced disasters. Therefore, this study maps critical aspects required for setting up a strong financial foundation for sustainable climate adaptation in Zimbabwe. It discusses the frameworks required for sustainable climate adaptation finance and suggests the direction for success in leveraging global climate financing towards building a low-carbon and climate-resilient Zimbabwe. The study involved a document review and analysis and stakeholder consultation methodological approach. The findings revealed that Zimbabwe has been significantly dependent on global finance mechanisms to mitigate the effects of climate change as its domestic finance mechanisms have not been fully explored. Results revealed the importance of partnership models between the state, individuals, civil society organisations, and agencies. Local financing institutions such as the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) have been set up. This operates a Climate Finance Facility (GFF), providing a domestic financial resource base. A climate change bill is also under formulation through government efforts. However, numerous barriers limit the adoption of adaptation practices, services, and technologies at the scale required. The absence of finance increases the vulnerability of local settlements (rural or urban) to extreme weather events leading to loss of life and property and compromised adaptive capacity. Therefore, the study recommends an adaptation financing framework aligned to different sectoral policies that can leverage diverse opportunities such as blended climate financing. The framework must foster synergies for improved impact and implementation of climate change adaptation initiatives for the country.

TI Measuring Child and Maternal Health in Developing Countries: A Proposal
   of New Hybrid MDG Composite Indices
SO APPLIED RESEARCH IN QUALITY OF LIFE
AB This paper proposes new hybrid composite indices from a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) indicators to measure child and maternal health in developing countries. Under a multi-criteria approach, we use a normalization formula with a double reference point scheme that includes an aggregation function with two reference values: aspiration and reservation. We rely on the distance P-2 method to calculate the importance (weights) of each MDG indicator in the multi-criteria approach and propose several indices with different degrees of substitutability among indicators. This hybrid approach allows us to assess the progress in child and maternal health in 90 developing countries in the framework of the MDGs, from which potential policy implications may derive for the implementation of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.

AB It is a priority to use new technologies in education at developing countries. There are plenty of software that is used at schools and higher education. Universities and non governmental organizations (NGOs) that work with partners from developing countries usually trust in the advantages of software applications for e-learning, b-learning or software applications for practical laboratories or administrative issues.
   It is curious that sometimes many institutions in our own (developed) countries take plenty of wrong decisions related the software that is used in education. But in this paper we are not going to talk about the software that should be used in education in general because it depends on the situation and context of each particular educational institution but we are going to discuss about a set of popular mistakes that are made again and again by institutions (universities from developed countries, NGOs, foundations, volunteer collaborators, etc.) when software applications are developed of just installed in educational education projects.

TI Sustainable and renewable implementation multi-criteria energy model
   (SRIME)-case study: Sri Lanka
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Sustainable and renewable are certainly very appreciated terms nowadays. These words may summarize a whole new attitude towards our world and the people who live in it. This paper's goal is to define an original multi-criteria energy model, named SRIME, specially designed for developing countries. First, an extensive research will be carried out on: energy demand; potential renewable energy, its current know-how and potential future development; potential avoided emissions (CO2, NOX, SO2); and the possible international support versus the in-country possibilities. The precedence constraints will be applied to establish in which degree renewable energy may be substituting for the fossil fuel: the purely economic approach will give way to a sustainable, renewable, development focused energy planning. It must be noted that an innovative function has been specifically included in the SRIME, which evaluates, applying the precedence constraints, the influence renewable energy may have on developing countries rural health and education. Six functions have been established: replaceable amount of fossil energy; CO2, NOX and SO2 avoidable emissions; rural health and education development maximization; and the cost function. These functions will be optimized through the Chebyshev distance (L-infinity) compromise programming minimization, so that the Pareto optimal solution may be obtained.

TI Solar-based rural electrification policy design: The Renewable Energy
   Service Company (RESCO) model in Fiji
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Solar photovoltaic technologies have for some time been promoted as a cost effective means of rural electrification in developing countries. However, institutional structures resulting in poor maintenance have adversely affected the sustainability of past solar projects. In Fiji, the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) program is the latest attempt to promote solar-based rural electrification in a fee-for-service model, aiming to remove the high upfront capital costs associated with solar technologies and using a public private sector partnership for maintenance. This paper assesses the program using survey and interview data. Major flaws are identified, relating to incorrect treatment of principal agent problems, information asymmetries, motivational problems, and resourcing of government agencies. General lessons for fee-for-service solar home system models emerge, including that incentives for stakeholders must take centre stage in designing and administering such programs, and that active government support and ownership are required to make programs sustainable.

However, ethical issues relevant to implementation of NHDWHs in LMICs remain largely ignored or, at best, inadequately addressed. In this paper, we highlight and critically analyze several of the key ethical issues, including privacy, informed consent and trust, confidentiality and security, secondary data use, sustainability and implementation validity, risk-benefit ratio, governance and conflict of interest, justice, equity, access, and collaborative partnerships. We then provide a set of guiding principles and points to consider for countries and implementers to guide further decision-making around ethics of implementing NHDWHs within LMICs.

TI Ozone pollution will compromise efforts to increase global wheat
   production
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Introduction of high-performing crop cultivars and crop/soil water management practices that increase the stomatal uptake of carbon dioxide and photosynthesis will be instrumental in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving food security. To date, however, global assessments of how to increase crop yield have failed to consider the negative effects of tropospheric ozone, a gaseous pollutant that enters the leaf stomatal pores of plants along with carbon dioxide, and is increasing in concentration globally, particularly in rapidly developing countries. Earlier studies have simply estimated that the largest effects are in the areas with the highest ozone concentrations. Using a modelling method that accounts for the effects of soil moisture deficit and meteorological factors on the stomatal uptake of ozone, we show for the first time that ozone impacts on wheat yield are particularly large in humid rain-fed and irrigated areas of major wheat-producing countries (e.g. United States, France, India, China and Russia). Averaged over 2010-2012, we estimate that ozone reduces wheat yields by a mean 9.9% in the northern hemisphere and 6.2% in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to some 85 Tg (million tonnes) of lost grain. Total production losses in developing countries receiving Official Development Assistance are 50% higher than those in developed countries, potentially reducing the possibility of achieving UN SDG2. Crucially, our analysis shows that ozone could reduce the potential yield benefits of increasing irrigation usage in response to climate change because added irrigation increases the uptake and subsequent negative effects of the pollutant. We show that mitigation of air pollution in a changing climate could play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned UN SDG, while also contributing to other SDGs related to human health and well-being, ecosystems and climate change.

TI An Overview: Tourism Non-governmental Organizations and Poverty
   Reduction in Developing Countries
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH
AB This article illustrates how select non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are using tourism as a development tool for poverty reduction. These tourism-oriented NGOs are becoming increasingly relevant as an alternative and legitimate source of development aid to many developing countries, since the turn of the 21st century. Many NGOs based in the developed world, in their quest to meet the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals, are partnering with developing world NGOs and communities to help create locally initiated solutions to poverty.
   These partnerships ensure community involvement and more direct benefits to communities, while creating sustainable solutions that preserve their culture and environment. Although there are several distinct types of tourism NGO providing both financial and non-financial benefits to poor and indigenous communities, this article focuses on three-educational and advocacy organizations, "voluntourism" organizations and tour company foundations-that have made substantial contributions to poverty reduction through sustainable tourism. Is this an effective means of providing communities with socially and environmentally responsible tourism in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Central and South America? This article suggests that it is; however, the lack of uniform standards for measuring the success of these organizations complicates efforts to ascertain the exact levels of poverty reduction.

TI Capacity building for implementation of nationally determined
   contributions under the Paris Agreement
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB The majority of developing countries have indicated capacity building as a condition for implementing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This is in the context of shortfalls in past initiatives on capacity building under different bilateral and multilateral agencies including bodies of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which can be largely attributed to their short-term, ad-hoc, supply-driven, and project-based nature. Article 11 of the Paris Agreement points to a potentially new paradigm for capacity building. Based on a review of literature on past experience, as well as analysis of countries? capacity building perspectives in the NDCs, this paper attempts to draw lessons for better capacity building for NDC implementation. The paper aims at answering the questions: What are the capacity building needs expressed in the NDCs? Where are the matches and mismatches with past efforts, and what kind of capacity building can address the current needs? We propose a capacity building framework that addresses climate change as a long term problem. We suggest that universities in developing countries should serve as central hubs for a sustainable, institution-based capacity building system, supported by strengthened partnerships and long term financing. Finally, we suggest that, for the next round of NDCs, developing countries should be more explicit and specific in their demands and approaches to capacity building. Key policy insights The next round of developing countries? NDCs should be more specific about their capacity building needs and align them better with the financial support system under the Paris Agreement. The capacity building needs identified in the NDCs fall short of learning from previous efforts, including that capacity building must be specific and demand-driven, to ensure country ownership. A new framework for capacity building needs to be established, with: a capacity building mechanism under the UNFCCC, developing country universities as the central hub; strengthened partnerships; and a long term financial support system. This framework should be tailored towards the differences in capacity needs among different groups of developing countries.

TI Financially sustainable investments in developing countries water
   sectors: what conditions could promote private sector involvement?
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB A scarcity of public resources and insufficient international aid have contributed to the deep crisis that water sectors in developing countries are in, as less has been invested than is considered necessary to improve and increase their efficiency. Private investment could therefore play a crucial role in the building of new infrastructure and in the restructuring of existing services. In fact, according to the Global Water Partnership's forecasts, to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal related to water, it will be necessary to increase the level of investment per year in the sector from 75 billion dollars to 180 billion dollars. The "Plan of Action" of the Second World Water Forum held in The Hague in 2000 stated that 95% of the additional investments in the water sector should come from the private sector, underlining the need for wider participation by the private sector through public-private partnerships. This means that water has to become a more attractive good from a financial point of view; however, this process requires the existence of a strong regulatory and legal system, transparent contractual procedures and risk allocation between parties. What is the present situation? Through analysis of the private sector's behaviour and amounts invested, and a description of the economic features of production and provision of water that have made it difficult for the private sector to be involved in an efficient way, this paper proposes the conditions required for the financial sustainability of investments in water sectors in developing countries.

TI Developing VAT treaties: international tax cooperation in times of
   global recovery
SO LEGAL STUDIES
AB The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the pressing need to address common challenges faced by all countries and, in particular, provide special support to developing countries through international cooperation. Taxation, in particular Value Added Tax (VAT), is a key area for strengthening international cooperation because of its critical role in financing the Covid-19 crisis and supporting global recovery. This paper proposes the adoption of VAT treaties based on two considerations. First, there exist, in the interplay between states' VAT laws, over-taxation and under-taxation that can be more effectively addressed by treaties than by unilateral state actions. Secondly, unlike income tax treaties, VAT treaties would distribute more benefits from cooperation to developing countries than to developed countries, leading to normatively attractive distributional consequences. The proposed model offers a new approach to taxing cross-border transactions under VAT and could form part of a coordinated response to a sustainable post-pandemic recovery.

TI Sustainable Location Selection for Investing in Public-Private
   Partnership Infrastructure Projects: From a Developing Country's
   Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Location selection is one of the most important aspects of feasibility studies in all types of businesses and construction fields. However, poor project location selection is one of the leading causes of project failure, adversely affecting the cost, schedule, and other benefits of investors. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for selecting a sustainable location for investing in public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in Vietnam. Nine success criteria are identified via a literature review and expert judgments. Then, the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is applied to compute the success index and rank three alternatives: Southern (A1), Northern (A2), and Mekong Delta (A3) regions. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the certainty and effectiveness of the model. The result indicates that alternative A1 is the best location for investing in the PPP form with a closeness coefficient (CCi) value of 0.555 and a sensitivity ratio of 11/13. This finding obtained using the proposed framework may be a helpful reference for practitioners and investors in selecting a sustainable location for PPP investment in Vietnam as well as other developing countries.

However, the processes and practices companies pursue to engage stakeholders tend to conspicuously be variable depending on whether one draws on the instrumental and descriptive perspectives of the stakeholder theory. The purpose of this paper is therefore to test these perspectives, which we do through considering the case of a subsidiary of a multinational firm fictitiously known as Ashford (Africa) Limited, which operates in Malawi, as a member of the global mining industry. Using qualitative data obtained from interviews with Ashford (Malawi)'s managers and stakeholders, this study highlights the significance of paying more attention to firm specific factors, community dynamics and the civil society (NGO) related factors, as they are fundamental to the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement agenda pursued by mining companies in the developing countries.

TI A three-pronged approach to advocacy for sustainable national funding
SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB By and large, the financial commitments 179 nations made to the family planning and reproductive health components of ICPD in 1994 were not kept. While donors ramp up support for civil society advocacy in developing countries, in hopes of improving national funding and outcomes, recent trends in advocacy evaluation leave unanswered the broader question of whether/how international campaigning can appropriately and effectively strengthen national-level decision-making. This article provides background regarding the challenges in monitoring developing country contributions; summarizes current donor initiatives to strengthen civil society advocacy; and reviews theoretical approaches to assessing advocacy. The author identifies major advocacy limitations and proposes a three-pronged approach to harmonize international and national advocacy messages for improved, sustained increases in health funding and outcomes, namely, that local accountability is paramount, that national health programmes must be designed as legally binding entitlements, and that pro-health values and norms must be strengthened.

TI Assisting Developing and Least Developed Countries in Legal Aspects of
   WTO Negotiations: A Case Study of the Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB The Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL) is an international organization charged with assisting developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs) in all legal aspects arising from the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Among its services, the ACWL provides, upon request, legal advice in WTO negotiations. The ACWL does not influence the political position of its Members or the LDCs. Rather, it confines itself to providing legal inputs that would enable its developing country Members and LDCs better to participate in WTO negotiations. In particular, the ACWL assists in drafting proposed legal provisions when a requesting government wishes to propose an idea. In addition, the ACWL conducts legal analyses of proposals tabled by other WTO Members in order to ascertain their potential legal effects were they to become part of the WTO covered agreements. In the context of the fisheries subsidies negotiations, the ACWL has made strides to become familiar with such areas as international law of the sea, fisheries law, and the legal aspects of sustainability and development in order to provide well informed legal advice to its developing country Members and the LDCs. Legal advice on the fisheries subsidies negotiations has, both qualitatively and quantitatively, become an important part of the ACWL's work.

AB Objectives: Review how agricultural systems might be changed to increase the vitamin A density of diets in developing countries to provide sustainable solutions to vitamin A deficiency globally.
   Design: Develop agricultural systems that not only assure calorie adequacy for people, but also address vitamin A density in diets.
   Settings: Agricultural systems could be modified in some developing nations in ways that would provide adequate dietary amounts of pro-vitamin A carotenoids from plant food sources.
   Subjects: Infants and children of low-income families are most at risk of developing vitamin A deficiency in developing countries.
   Interventions: Cropping systems could be modified to include more vegetable and fruit crops containing higher bioavailable amounts of provitamin A carotenoids in some countries. Additionally, cultural practices could be modified through education, agricultural extension and/or social marketing to insure that the bioavailable provitamin A carotenoid levels in food crops are optimized. Staple food crops could be improved as sources of provitamin A carotenoids by traditional plant breeding and/or by genetic engineering efforts.
   Results: Currently, many techniques are available to increase the vitamin A content of diets through sustainable food-based approaches. Agricultural approaches should be examined closely to finding sustainable food-based system solutions to vitamin A deficiency globally.
   Conclusions: The world community should strive to find food-based system approaches to eliminating vitamin A deficiency. Modifying agricultural systems in ways that will not only maximizing food production, but also insure nutritional adequacy of vitamin A is a desirable goal for many developing countries.

SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB At the International Symposium on "The New Silk Road and China-Africa Economic Relations" held in Kenya, some 30 scholars shared their understanding of the "One Belt One Road" plan announced by the Chinese government. The themes of the symposium covered the definition and political-economic implications of "One Belt One Road," its effects on China-Africa economic relationships, and the key points and procedures of related projects. Most of the scholars attending the symposium declared that " One Belt One Road" is the updated version of traditional forms of Chinese aid to developing countries, especially African countries, and meets the need for cooperation among developing countries and the industry upgrading of Chinese enterprises. The plan's core ideas differ from those of the United States; they represent a new international order and an emerging model of regional cooperation and international economic cooperation. As well, recommendations on fostering state-owned enterprise systems and a sustainable labor force in African countries were also discussed.

TI ICT for education projects: a look from behind the scenes
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB Much of the ICT facilities in developing countries' educational institutions are not used and ICT for Development projects have high rates of failure. The reasons for this phenomenon are structural and embedded in the very fabric of the Cooperation & Development project management practices. Bureaucracies' requirements, transaction costs, sustainability concerns, mutual perception and identity negotiation between "developer" and "developee" and above all, a mechanistic mindset for both education and reality in general, are crucial factors in shaping the project implementation, often in contrast with the public rhetoric about it. The role of technology in this complex dynamic is addressed critically, pointing out some structural reasons for its failure to deliver the expected benefits in the mid-long run, namely: the industrialism burden, the daily digital divides and the omission of maintenance. A radical change of mindset is called for, one to be applied both to aid and education.

TI Circular Economy, International Cooperation, and Solid Waste Management:
   A Development Project in La Paz (Bolivia)
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper introduces the preliminary results of a development project focused on waste recycling and recovery in La Paz (Bolivia). The aim is to share best practices and to present real-world challenges when implementing appropriate waste management systems in developing countries. Environmental pollution, social inequality, lack of resources, and economic discrepancies are challenges still present in the 21st century, and a global call-for-action is needed to support sustainable development. The project "LaPazRecicla", financed by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, provides perspectives that are potentially useful for policy-makers, waste management practitioners, and circular economy visionaries. The article aims to present the effective contribution of the practical actions to the local municipality, and to introduce the reason for why theoretical methods were employed to support the project. The outcomes provided two main indications: on one hand, cooperation among interdisciplinary actors and financial support can give the chance of improvement, suggesting international donors should continue in this direction; on the other, political instability, lack of local technical knowledge, and the absence of planning for a long-term period makes these actions unsuitable for tangible change. Global reflections are required in order to measure the potential benefits of small-scale projects, evaluating the time needed to move towards a sustainable future in low-income countries.

TI Public-private partnership in solid waste management sector in the West
   Bank of Palestine
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Palestine, being a developing country, faces lots of obstacles and deficiencies in the existing solid waste management (SWM) field. In wake of these circumstances, it seems hard for the public sector to run sustainable SWM systems. The overall objective of the research presented in this paper was to study the current status of the SWM field in the West Bank of Palestine under the perspective of potential private sector involvement. For this purpose, twelve Joint Service Councils (JSCs) for solid waste management were investigated. Out of them, only two are currently having a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contract for the management and operation of the transfer station and the sanitary landfill. On the other hand, two JSCs are currently making arrangements and implementing studies for future PPPs on waste-to-energy, biowaste management and recycling projects. Jenin and Tubas Joint Service Council (JSC) had 3-month-duration PPP contract for the implementation of a recycling project, which is a worst case scenario as it failed to meet its objectives. The parameters that could encourage JSCs or ease the implementation of PPP in local SWM field are analysed. Overall conclusion is that sustainability can be accelerated once the governmentrepresented by the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG)is involved; providing legal support to local authorities and incentives to potential contractors in order to encourage them to join PPPs. Parameters that are believed to facilitate PPPs include the following: development or updating existing laws and regulations, facilitation of licensing procedures, and activation of the Investment Promotion Law. Feasibility and market analysis study implementation will indicate the appropriate actions required locally to achieve environmental and financial sustainability in all contracted PPPs.

TI An international comparative analysis of local hazard mitigation plan
   evaluation for flood The USA, Japan and Korea
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose - This research aims to identify the qualitative differences between local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP) of the developing country when compared to those of developed countries. It also seeks to demonstrate the relative importance of public private partnership and the need for PPs to be integrated into LHMP because they help to create strong LHMP, thereby making communities will become more resilient to not only floods but also other natural disasters. It focuses on the components of hazard mitigation from a developed country perspective and how these influence the contents/focus of the LHMP especially when compared to those of a developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on official information such as population, climate and major threat that has faced, research sites were selected. Each LHMP can be downloaded from the official city websites, except Korea. Through plan evacuation protocols the LHMP for each city - USA (Baltimore), Japan (Kumamoto) and Korea (Pohang) - were assessed three times by the research team. Plans were evaluated using a plan coding evacuation process.
   Findings - The LHMP of the developing country did not contain maps illustrating to the people who are exposed to flood and evacuation routes and who are vulnerable (both economically and physically), when compared with the developed countries plan. However, quicker response because of simple political hierarchy can be possible in Japan and Korea when compared to the USA, which has three different tiers of political governments - federal, State and Local government - though Korea is a developing country.
   Originality/value - In recent times, pre-disaster response, which is a proactive approach to natural disasters, is an emerging issue rather than post disaster response because of sustainable and resilient ideas of the locals that have repeatedly suffered from natural hazards. This study compares LHMPs of each country to better understand strengths and weakness, as well as to identify strategies that will enhance the quality of mitigation plan for the developed country and developing country. It is hoped that this study will inform and augment existing literature by assisting underdeveloped and developing countries suffering from floods with the preparation of their LHMPs based on the suggestion of this research.

AB This paper explores the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to promote modern bioenergy options in developing countries. The starting point is that developing countries need to be given a major role in the implementation of the Convention on Climate Change because of their increasing energy demands and the pressing need to mitigate climate change. The role of CDM is discussed in the context of sustainable development. formation of carbon markets, and promotion of bioenergy options. Besides contributing to mitigate climate change, CDM can be used to demonstrate and disseminate new technologies. reduce investment risks and enhance the cost-efficiency of projects, while also creating jobs and improving environmental conditions. In this context. bioenergy projects are attractive and CDM provides a complementary bridge for international cooperation towards sustainable development. However, since CDM is project-based, a broader policy framework is needed to integrate such projects in regional and global bioenergy systems solutions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current global health system, which concentrates on a few and neglects billions of people who live in resource-poor settings and carry the largest burden of global diseases, is unacceptable. The weight of medical practice patterns ought to shift from the therapeutic phase of medical care to prevention. Achieving better health for the majority of humanity requires innovation, improved resources, new cooperation between the rich and the poor, and a clear ethical vision, consolidated by goal-oriented and system-focused strategic health planning. Development assistance from wealthier nations to developing countries must shift from the current donor-driven agendas to country-driven sector-wide approaches for health development with adequate accountability and sustainability. There must be a fundamental departure from classical universalism to new universalism, reoriented by a new public health, and reinforced by a new solidarity, using holistic approaches to ensure better health for the whole of humanity.

TI Achieving SDG target 8.1 (sustain economic growth) in developing
   countries: how aid for trade policy and regulations can assist?
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN TRADE STUDIES
AB Purpose
   This study aims to examine how aid for trade policy and regulations (AfTPR) contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 8.1 (sustain per capita economic growth) and whether the effectiveness of AfTPR is conditional to the stable political environment.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper uses a widely accepted endogenous growth framework and applies panel data fixed effects and two-step difference and system generalized method of moments estimation strategies on panel data of 50 developing countries over 2005-2017.
   Findings
   The findings of the study confirm that aid to trade policy promotes sustainable economic growth in developing countries, but this category of development assistance is only effective and significant for low and lower middle-income (LLMI) economies. The positive and significant effect of AfTPR in upper middle-income countries is conditional to their level of political stability. Under a stable political situation, the positive effect of AfTPR on sustainable growth remains almost same for the LLMI countries, whereas for the upper middle-income countries this growth effect reached almost double.
   Research limitations/implications
   International trade is considered as a driver for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, whereas aid for trade is acknowledged for its prospective contribution toward achieving these goals. The findings have dominant policy implications for the international development organizations and donors, which recommend that it is more desirable to transmit aid toward developing and implementing trade policy and regulations as per capita economic growth improves in the aid recipient countries.
   Originality/value
   According to the authors' knowledge, no prior study empirically analyzes the effect of AfTPRs on SDG target 8.1.

TI MNEs' regional headquarters and their CSR agenda in the African context
SO INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW
AB Purpose - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives can provide a mechanism for tapping into the vast consumer markets of developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how regional headquarters (RHQs) of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Africa pursue CSR and whether their initiatives are aligned with their own global CSR agendas or tailored to local idiosyncrasies. Design/methodology/approach - Following a secondary data analysis of MNEs' CSR and sustainability reports and their homepages, in-depth interviews with their CSR managers in African RHQs are conducted.
   Findings - The paper provides insights into motivations of RHQs to pursue specific CSR initiatives. MNEs need to make considerable adaptations to their global CSR agendas in order to develop initiatives that fit the local setting. The authors further identify key institutions in developing countries and discuss the potential of collaborations with MNEs in their CSR initiatives.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research should assess the impact of environmental differences (e.g. developing nations compared to industrialized nations) and firm characteristics on CSR autonomy (both at RHQs and at the subsidiary level). Furthermore, the perspectives of the various stakeholders (such as local governments or NGOs) should be examined to establish a holistic understanding of CSR in developing countries.
   Practical implications - MNEs gain a better understanding of peculiarities encountered in developing countries and are provided with recommendations on how to develop their CSR policies.
   Social implications - The paper directs awareness to CSR in the African context, thereby providing a platform for understanding some of this continent's most important challenges.
   Originality/value - The paper shows how the context of developing countries shapes the translation process of MNEs' global CSR agendas. Companies benefit from the best practice examples provided in this paper and learn from the stakeholder collaborations discussed.

TI Critical barriers to brownfield redevelopment in developing countries:
   The case of Pakistan
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Due to the scarcity of land for urban development, Brownfield Redevelopment (BR) is considered a sustainable urban land tool in developed countries, but its adoption in developing countries remains in its infancy. Barriers impeding BR need to be investigated in detail. However, few studies have analyzed barriers to BR in developing countries. This study aims to analyze the critical barriers to BR in Pakistan by using a two-stage methodology including the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Initially, 41 barriers were identified through a comprehensive literature review. FDM screened out 33 barriers through expert opinion. Survey questionnaires were sent to major stakeholders involved in the BR process. Finally, valid responses were analyzed using SEM to verify and rank the most critical barriers. Study results indicated 26 critical barriers. The top five critical barriers were lack of policy incentives, the complexity of public-private partnerships, lack of professional and technical personnel, the conflict between stakeholders, and lack of awareness of environmental law. A comparative analysis of barriers to BR in Pakistan and other countries including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, and China showed that critical barriers vary by country. Furthermore, factor analysis results extracted five major categories for 26 critical barriers, including political and legal barriers, financial and economic barriers, technical and operational barriers, management system barriers, and environmental barriers. The most dominant barrier category was technical and operational barriers, impeding BR in Pakistan. This study creates value in the BR literature by identifying the most critical barriers to BR in a developing country. It could support practitioners and land use policy makers in developing appropriate strategies to promote BR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to this, petrol/diesel generators are used for electricity generation in various sectors of the country, which are not eco-friendly. Though developing countries are thought to emit lesser greenhouse gases compared to industrialized nations, due to low industrial activities, a global cooperation is necessary to mitigate climate change.
   The intent of this paper is to develop solar power generation systems through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which involves investments in clean technologies, in developing countries by governments, companies or agencies from developed countries, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, at an optimum cost. This could offer a possible solution to energy poverty, and also lead to sustainable development in developing countries, including Nigeria. Case studies were conducted for Nigeria using small-scale PV systems for different applications. The paper also presents the modalities for CDM agreement between two parties, the benefits and challenges. The CO2 emissions that could be avoided by adopting the proposed energy systems are also discussed.

   Technologies (STCT 9)
CY JUN 22-26, 1998
CL FONT ROMEU, FRANCE
AB Prospective studies generally evaluate the contribution of solar energy to the world energy mix in the range of hundreds of Mtoe. Considering the actual mature solar technologies, this figure leads to a potential of hundreds of solar power plants at the horizon 2020. Development of such a programme requires RD&D to reduce costs and elaborate new systems. It requires also incentives to favour the initial market penetration in a context of low prices of energy. Along with some other technologies, solar power has the potential to mitigate the CO2 problem and therefore appears as a competitor in the international environment protection system. Several economic tools are available or under discussion to help financing the "incremental cost" of development projects in developing countries which are less emitting than current practices. The concept of activities implemented jointly" can foster the partnerships for both climate and development, and finally give support to solar energy. As a non polluting and long lasting technology, solar thermal power appears as a potential contributor to sustainable development. Nevertheless, in the context of hard competition for financing priorities, it has to prove that it is really good for economic development and that developing countries can afford it.

TI Local perceptions on factors influencing the introduction of
   international healthcare accreditation in Pakistan
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB One contributor to poor health outcomes in developing countries is weak health systems; key to strengthening them are interventions to improve quality of health services. Though the value of healthcare accreditation is increasingly recognized, there are few case studies exploring its adaptation in developing countries. The aim of our study in Pakistan was to identify perceived factors influencing the adaptation of international healthcare accreditation within a developing country context. We used qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, a structured group discussion, focus groups and non-participant observation of management meetings. Data analysis used a grounded theory approach and a conceptual framework adapted from implementation science. Using our conceptual framework categories of 'inner' and 'outer' setting, we found six perceived inner health system factors that could influence the introduction of healthcare accreditation and two 'outer' setting factors, perceived as external to the health system but able to influence its introduction. Our research identified that there is no 'one size fits all' approach to introducing healthcare accreditation as a means to improve healthcare quality. Those planning to support healthcare accreditation, such as national and provincial ministries and international development partners, need to understand how the three components of healthcare accreditation fit into the local health system and into the broader political and social environment. In our setting this included moving to supportive and transparent external evaluation mechanisms, with a first step of using locally developed and agreed standards. In addition, sustainable implementation of the three components was seen as a major challenge, especially establishment of a well-managed, transparent accreditation agency able to lead processes such as training and support for peer surveyors. Consideration of local change mechanisms and cultural practices is important in designing a local accreditation approach. The results of our study are important for health systems strengthening in Pakistan and in other developing countries.

TI Using Qualitative System Dynamics Analysis to Promote Inclusive
   Livestock Value Chains: A Case Study of the South African Broiler Value
   Chain
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Livestock value chains globally are increasingly dualistic, with integrated market-leaders co-existing with comparatively disadvantaged small producers who, nevertheless, support rural livelihoods and food access, and can also contribute to more resilient supply chains. The South African broiler value chain provides a highly illustrative case study. The purpose of this study is to identify potential leverage points for policy intervention to support small and emerging producers in the South African broiler value chain, and to discuss the strengths and limitations of system dynamics approaches to promote inclusive food value chains. This study develops a causal loop diagram (CLD) based on semi-structured stakeholder interviews and policy documents. The main challenges, key variables and causal relationships between them are systematically identified. Variables are coded, generalised and graphically represented, and entry points for intervention and their links to existing policies are mapped. The challenges faced by smallholders in the context of our study can be characterised, using a CLD, as a set of interlinked and reinforcing dynamics which perpetuate existing disadvantages and reinforce duality in the value chain. Key policy entry points have been identified that could be targeted by a coordinated policy package, including: Direct support for infrastructure investment and input access through grants, subsidies or other policies; credit and liquidity provision for day-to-day expenses; creation of aggregation mechanisms for both inputs and outputs; regulations or initiatives that directly target the relationship of farmers with the commercial segment to improve access to day-old-chicks and, finally, training in business and technical skills. Although most of these interventions have been addressed at some point, implementation has been fragmented, failing to fully consider their complementary nature, thus undermining effectiveness. Existing approaches to consensus building and stakeholder participation in system dynamics research can present challenges when it comes to engaging with complex policy processes and issues of conflict of interest that are relevant in the context of smallholder promotion and equitable food systems, but there are promising avenues for addressing. Despite some methodological challenges, we find that there is considerable scope for system dynamics approaches to inform policy for smallholder promotion, even in contexts characterised by complex policy processes.

TI Effects of Science, Technology, and Innovation Official Development
   Assistance on Innovative Capacity in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study aims to empirically investigate the effect of Science, Technology, and Innovation Official Development Assistance (STI ODA) on the innovative capacity of developing countries. Particularly, this study attempted to examine the moderating effects of R&D investment and its effect on innovative capacity. To do this, a panel fixed model analysis was carried out with ODA and macroeconomic data on 84 developing countries from 2002 to 2018. The findings indicated that STI ODA was found to have no direct positive effect on innovative capacity. However, it had a positive effect on innovative capacity when the moderating effect of R&D investment was significant and when the proportion of R&D investment increased. The findings of this study serve as a guide for policymakers in terms of having better understanding of the relationship between STI ODA, R&D investment, and innovative capacity. Hence, policy makers and practitioners are able to design a good policy to be adopted such that absorptive capacity should be prioritized for STI ODA to be effective in helping developing countries to escape poverty and achieve sustainable development goals. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to analyze the moderating effect of R&D investment on the relationship between STI ODA and innovative capacity in a developing country context.

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper analyses the role of official development assistance (ODA) in the evolution of Technological Innovation Systems (TISs) of improved cookstoves in Kenya and Rwanda. Functionally balanced TISs are central to the diffusion of new technologies and practices. We find that ODA has significantly influenced major innovation activities related to improved cookstoves in both Kenya and Rwanda over the last 30 years. However, donors' funding has been focused mainly on the development and diffusion of technical knowledge. We find that this pattern of ODA support has not fostered balanced and effective Technology Innovation Systems, and that this has contributed to the failure to achieve widespread diffusion of improved cookstoves. We develop a quasi evolutionary model for the long-term and systematic ODA support of innovation systems to build sustainable renewable energy TISs in developing countries.

SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB The paper presents a number of ideas on how climate change policy implementation in developing countries can be supported by alternative international cooperation mechanisms that are based on stakeholder interests and policy priorities including broader economic and social development issues. It includes a brief review of current development policies, technological research and promotion efforts, and climate change that demonstrates that mutual policy initiatives undertaken by governments and the private sector actually have major positive impacts on climate change without being initiated by this global policy concern. Furthermore a number of examples are given on how future development objectives in Brazil, China, and India jointly can support economic and social goals and global climate change concerns if these goals are taken into consideration and supported by international cooperative mechanisms. The paper proposes international cooperative mechanisms that can support the implementation of integrated development and climate change policies. The mechanisms include an international sustainable development (SD) and Climate Finance Mechanism (SDCFM), technology development and transition programmes, technology standards, and other measures.

This is considered in relation to fisheries access agreements in the Central and Western Pacific where several least developed but resource rich island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu are highly exposed to the risks associated with new WTO fisheries subsidies disciplines that do not consider their particular vulnerabilities. The paper considers some of the issues that coastal developing countries should incorporate into their emerging negotiating positions at the WTO. State-to-Sate fisheries access agreements which are often highly subsidised but where fishing vessel owners pay the equivalent of lump sum tax are paradoxically, the least distortionary and damaging to the environment.

TI Pressures for sustainability practices in an oil and gas company:
   evidence from Sudan
SO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the pressures to adhere to sustainability practices in an oil company in Sudan and its response to these pressures.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative case study research was conducted through interviews with the case company's managers and various external stakeholders. The interviews were complemented by several informal conversations, observations and documentary materials.
   Findings - There were external and internal pressures exerted on the company to adopt sustainability practices. However, the coercive pressures did not necessarily bring about a real change in the organisation. The forces of change were mainly the foreign partner's audit pressure and the nongovernmental organisation (NGO) allegations, which were given serious attention, due to the importance of reputation as an asset to the company.
   Practical implications - Clear regulatory frameworks, more direct engagement with NGOs and meeting the expectations of the local communities were considered as crucial factors to ensure there is a pathway for sustainability in the oil and gas industry of developing countries.
   Originality/value - Most previous studies on the motivation for corporate sustainability practices focussed on external pressures. This study examined the specific types of stakeholders' group, among the internal and external stakeholders, that has most influence on the organisation's sustainability practices, in the context of a developing country with weak regulatory governance.

AB Twenty years since the Rio Summit, the global community is still struggling to develop a world with universal access to sustainable energy services. The discussion on energy and its linkages with sustainable development is at the heart of the debate in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This paper discusses the role of innovations in terms of partnerships and business models to enhance energy access, especially for those living at the so-called bottom of pyramid. The role of innovative energy options and policy choices that enable overall operationalization of energy access in developing countries as well as new forms of partnerships and innovative mechanisms that are based on established success, replicability and potential for scaling up has been examined through two case-studies, namely the Lighting a Billion Lives project and India's National Rural Electrification Programme. This paper suggests the need for new forms of public and private sector partnerships, especially the pro-poor ones that are effective in enhancing energy access. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The Quest for Accountable Governance: Embedded NGOs and Demand Driven
   Advocacy in the International Trade Regime
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The ongoing failure of the multilateral trade regime to deliver on global development priorities has produced a new brand of expert. Embedded NGOs have emerged with the expressed aim to socially embed global markets, carve out additional policy or development space for developing countries, increase their negotiating capacity, and promote the three pillars of sustainable development economic, social and environment. Eschewing conventional advocacy or protest work that challenges received wisdom, Embedded NGOs leverage their legal and technical trade-related expertise across a range of issue areas that are of primary concern to poor countries. This article develops a conceptual framework for analysing the impact of Embedded NGOs on the World Trade Organization's (WTO) accountability regime. While Embedded NGOs show good prospects for improving the inclusion and negotiating capacity of developing countries, the institutional and geographical attributes of Embedded NGOs, the uneven engagement by Embedded NGOs with developing countries, their commitment to a liberal economic order, and the internal and external accountability of Embedded NGOs themselves serve to reinforce dominant trade narratives and power asymmetries in global trade.

TI Drivers and constraints of waste-to-energy incineration for sustainable
   municipal solid waste management in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Implementation of waste-to-energy (WtE) incineration has recently surged in developing countries, but the drivers of this growth and the constraints on WtE project sustainability in local contexts remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify these drivers and constraints in developing countries using Hanoi Capital, Vietnam, as a case study. Face-to-face interviews and a field survey were employed to investigate stakeholders' opinions and consolidate WtE-related information to identify drivers. The main drivers were the current limited treatment capability, local opposition to current strategies, introduction of legislative incentives and landfilling restrictions, the Hanoi government's involvement, the example set by the existing WtE plant in Can Tho, increasing waste generation with increasing land scarcity, competitive tipping fees, and introduction of a public-private-partnership model. Some of these identified drivers eliminated historical Vietnamese WtE barriers. Constraints were determined by evaluating the interview results and local data from the field survey. These constraints had legal aspects (e.g., overlapping agency responsibilities), as well as financial (e.g., low tipping fees), technical/technological (e.g., unsorted waste), environmental (e.g., lack of stringent flue gas controls), and social (public opposition to plants) aspects. The evidence presented here could help secure waste treatment capacity through sustainable WtE incineration in other fast-growing cities.

TI Importance of rural bioenergy for developing countries
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Energy resources will play an important role in the world's future. Rural bioenergy is still the predominant form of energy used by people in the less developed countries, and bioenergy from biomass accounts for about 15% of the world's primary energy consumption and about 38% of the primary energy consumption in developing countries. Furthermore, bioenergy often accounts for more than 90% of the total rural energy supplies in some developing countries. Earth life in rural areas of the world has changed dramatically over time. Industrial development in developing countries, coming at a time of low cost plentiful oil supplies, has resulted in greater reliance on the source of rural bioenergy than is true in the developed countries. In developed countries, there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bioenergy conversion using a range of biofuels, which are becoming cost wise competitive with fossil fuels. Currently, much attention has been a major focus on renewable alternatives in the developing countries. Renewable energy can be particularly appropriate for developing countries. In rural areas, particularly in remote locations, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. Renewable energy can facilitate economic and social development in communities but only if the projects are intelligently designed and carefully planned with local input and cooperation. Particularly in poor rural areas, the costs of renewable energy projects will absorb a significant part of participants' small incomes. Bio-fuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. Biomass and biofuels can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels to generate heat, power and/or chemicals. Generally speaking, biofuels are generally considered as offering many benefits, including sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional development, social structure and agriculture and security of supply.

TI The effect of local and global learning on the cost of renewable energy
   in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB High upfront costs are a critical barrier for investments in clean infrastructure technologies in developing countries. This paper uses a case study of Thailand's electricity sector to create realistic estimates for the relative contributions of local and global technological learning to reducing these cost in the future and discusses implications of such learnings for international climate policy. For six renewable electricity technologies, we derive estimates for the share of locally and globally sourced goods and services, and analyze the effects of local and global learning during the implementation of Thailand's renewable energy targets for 2021. Our results suggest that, in aggregate, the largest potential for cost reduction lies in local learning. This finding lends quantitative support to the argument that the conditions enabling local learning, such as a skilled workforce, a stable regulatory framework, and the establishment of sustainable business models, have a more significant impact on cost of renewable energy in developing countries than global technology learning curves. The recent shift of international support under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change towards country-specific technology support is therefore promising. However, our results also show that the relative importance of local and global learning differs significantly between technologies, and is determined by technology and country characteristics. This suggests that international support need to consider both the global perspective and local context and framework conditions in order to reap the full benefits of technological learning across the wide range of clean technologies.

TI International Cooperation for Metal Recycling From Waste Electrical and
   Electronic Equipment An Assessment of the "Best-of-Two-Worlds" Approach
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB This article addresses a market-based management concept for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) known as the "best-of-two-worlds" approach. The concept is based on the idea that recyclers in developing countries and emerging economies can cooperate with technologically advanced refineries in industrialized countries to facilitate efficient recovery of valuable metals, such as gold and palladium, from e-waste. The article provides an overview of technical and environmental concerns underlying the concept and sheds light on the political framework, the waste-related trade issues, and the resource economics that need to be considered for further decision making. Building on this synthesis, I conduct a qualitative assessment of sustainability impacts of the proposed concept by analyzing two scenarios and their associated risks.
   The analysis suggests that, under certain preconditions, the best-of-two-worlds concept could yield significant improvements in terms of management of hazardous substances, resource efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, income generation, and investments into social and environmental standards. Generally, two potential implementation scenarios were identified: Whereas under Scenario 1 only WEEE generated within developing countries and emerging economies is managed through the best-of-two-worlds approach, Scenario 2 additionally incorporates WEEE imported from industrialized countries. Although both scenarios can yield a variety of benefits, Scenario 2 might cause a net flow of hazardous substances from industrialized countries into developing countries and emerging economies, thus leading to less beneficial sustainability impacts.

TI Electronic health records implementation in Morocco: Challenges of silo
   efforts and recommendations for improvements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Objective: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) interventions hold the promise for enabling better healthcare. However, the implementation of EHR systems has been scarce in developing countries. The objective of this study is to investigate the state of EHRs implementation in Morocco; and draw insights for potential improvements.
   Materials and methods: University Medical Centers, known by locals in French as Centres Hospitalier Universitaires (CHU), are the largest and most advanced public healthcare centers in Morocco. A two-phase qualitative study was conducted in four out of the five CHUs. Phase One involved data collection through semi-structured interviews with 27 clinician champions, administrators, and medical directors. Phase Two included a brainstorming session during a health informatics conference held in Fes, Morocco. The data were analyzed using inductive analysis.
   Results: We identified five main categories of challenges due to silo strategies: (1) EHRs selection and weak bargaining power, (2) identical errors repeated across silos, (3) a lack of interoperability standards, (4) insufficient human and financial, and (5) missed cooperation and collaboration opportunities.
   Discussion: While identifying these silo challenges is an important milestone, proposing guidelines to address these challenges can bring Morocco and similar developing countries a step closer to improving healthcare through the use of health informatics and EHRs. Our recommendations for public healthcare organizations are threefold: (1) recognize the power of partnerships among all CHUs, (2) establish an e-health framework, and (3) seek national and international collaborations to drive and shape the eHealth agenda. Furthermore, we align our recommendations with the World Health Organization toolkit for an eHealth strategy to further benefit developing countries.
   Conclusion: This study identifies the challenges faced by the Moroccan EHRs implementation silo-ed strategy, and it proposes practical and fundamental guidelines to address these challenges and develop an interoperable and sustainable national eHealth system in Morocco and similar developing countries.

TI INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF CAD/CAM CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES: CASE STUDY
   OF A GERMAN-IRANIAN PARTNERSHIP
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Considering the increasing interest in international technology transfer, and the increasing need of Iranian society for safe housing, this paper examines the multinational contributions that help assure successful introduction of advanced CAD/CAM construction technologies into developing countries, taking Iran as promising example and considering Germany as the technology source. In particular, the paper focuses on construction of safe housing as the major burden of sustainable development in emerging nations. Technology transfer projects include transfer of knowledge (software) and skills/tools (hardware). In this case, the technology project has been divided into three parts, the CAD/CAM software, the automated CNC-machines and the knowledge/skills to run the enterprise. Based on technology transfer models gathered from previous literature, and consideration of existing technical, organizational, and cultural issues a model for the successful transfer, localization and implementation of CAD/CAM construction technologies is developed. This study reveals that successful transfer of the high-level CAD/CAM technologies requires involvement of a diverse group of individuals, corporations, and non-business organizations in both countries. These stakeholders have been identified and their involvement in the process of preparation, planning, decision-making, construction and implementation has been demonstrated.

TI Soaring antiretroviral prices, TRIPS and TRIPS flexibilities: a burning
   issue for antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries
SO CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS
AB Purpose of review
   The achievement of significant reductions in the price of antiretroviral drugs constitutes one of the main economic pillars of antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries. Today this economic pillar is threatened.
   Recent findings
   The prohibitive prices of newer first-line and second-line regimens have created a watershed in relation to the prices of earlier first-line treatments. These price increases are closely related to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) that imposes an important barrier to generic competition. Intellectual property flexibilities foreseen by the TRIPS agreement allow the manufacture and supply of affordable generic versions of new generations of antiretroviral under certain conditions. However, the capacity to supply a specified list of generics under such conditions is tight and the utilization of such flexibilities in their current form remains complex and unattractive.
   Summary
   The TRIPS agreement currently constitutes a significant barrier to providing access to new antiretroviral at affordable prices in developing countries. If the debate on initiatives for increased flexibility of intellectual property rights does not become more extensive or obtain the overwhelming support of the international community, serious consequences are to be expected in terms of the fight against AIDS in most of the developing countries.

TI Partnerships for development: Municipal solid waste management in
   Kasese, Uganda
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste management systems of many developing countries are commonly constrained by factors such as limited financial resources and poor governance, making it a difficult proposition to break with complex, entrenched and unsustainable technologies and systems. This article highlights strategic partnerships as a way to affect a distributed agency among several sets of stakeholders to break so-called path dependencies, which occur when such unsustainable pathways arise, stabilize and become self-reinforcing over time. Experiences from a North-South collaborative effort provide some lessons in such partnership building: In Uganda and Denmark, respectively, the World Wildlife Fund and the network organization access2innovation have mobilized stakeholders around improving the municipal solid waste management system in Kasese District. Through a municipal solid waste management system characterization and mapping exercise, some emergent lessons and guiding principles in partnership building point to both pitfalls and opportunities for designing sustainable pathways. First, socio-technical lock-in effects in the municipal solid waste management system can stand in the way of partnerships based on introducing biogas or incineration technologies. However, opportunities in the municipal solid waste management system can exist within other areas, and synergies can be sought with interlinking systems, such as those represented with sanitation.

TI Revealing causal pathways to sustainable water service delivery using
   fsQCA
SO JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB This study aimed to build on theory and practice regarding the combinations of conditions that influence water service sustainability when external partners are involved. The study investigates 26 well projects that have been implemented in developing countries with the assistance of Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA). Using past literature on sustainable water service delivery in developing communities, emergent coding techniques with project documents, and surveys with EWB-USA team members, this study identifies a set of project conditions to conduct fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Findings show that the presence of a water committee cannot alone account for project sustainability. Additional conditions, such as technology and construction processes, project governance, and community engagement practices must also be considered for project sustainability. The relationship between construction quality and financial sustainability is also discussed. Overall, the findings from this research contribute to sector theory and reveal distinct pathways towards sustainable water services. These findings informed recommendations for EWB-USA well project implementation and management, and demonstrate the utility of fsQCA as a tool to navigate the complexities of water service delivery by external partners and improve understanding to increase water service sustainability.

TI BEPS: Changing International Fiscal Standards and the Unchanging
   Fortunes of 'Sustainable Development'
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The OECD led BEPS project attempts key changes to the international tax standards to limit harmful tax avoidance. First, it is found that calls for the BEPS project are based on arguments (illicit financial flows and tax competition) that are supported by limited evidence and hence may not offer much fiscal gain to the developing countries. Second, it is found that the BEPS project would, through information sharing, further limit the fiscal jurisdiction of capital importing states. Further it is found that tax competition, even if existing in a limited form, is a result of the international tax architecture and the externalities caused by it. In fact, it is seen that the MNCs actually reduce the inefficiencies created by this tax architecture and thereby reduce transaction costs. By agreeing to the BEPS agenda of information sharing the developing countries would be paying the cost of internalising the externality.

MNCs are not only considered an obstacle to development but also as sources of solutions to some of the pressing social and environmental problems facing these communities. This article reviews the way in which companies frame (a) sustainable community development, and (b) their engagements in the community. It then considers the implications of both for sustainable community development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. The article then proposes an agenda for future research centering on how corporations innovate in their governance roles and the conditions in which community development innovations are created, take shape, and are put into practice.

TI The Green Dilemma about Liberalization of Trade in Environmental Goods
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Environmental goods are a key element of the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Conventional wisdom argues that trade liberalization of environmental goods is crucial in the sustainable economic development process as it sustains potential benefits for promoting environmental protection and economic development. For many, the ongoing WTO Doha negotiations represent an opportunity to enhance the mutual supportiveness of trade and enviromnent. However, as this article shows, the policy choice for most developing countries is not so clear-cut. The truth is that most of them might not be better off with ambitious trade liberalization in this sector. This article attempts to answer if trade liberalization in environmental goods helps developing countries. If so, which trade liberalization policy would serve in best interest of Os well as benefit these as well as benefit of these countries. Lastly, this article also looks at various scenarios of environmental goods liberalization in the context of the ongoing proposals on the WTO negotiating table and tries to assess how they measure up against the development objectives of the negotiations.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB International scientific partnerships are key to the success of strategic investments in plant science research and the farm-level adoption of new varieties and technologies, as well as the coherence of agricultural policies across borders to address global challenges. Such partnerships result not only in a greater impact of published research enhancing the career development of early and later stage researchers, but they also ensure that advances in plant science and crop breeding technologies make a meaningful contribution to society by brokering acceptance of emerging solutions to the world problems. We discuss the evidence showing that despite a lack of funding, scientists in some African countries make a significant contribution to global science output. We consider the criteria for success in establishing long-term scientific partnerships between scientists in developing countries in Southern Africa ("the South") and developed countries such as the UK ("the North"). We provide our own personal perspectives on the key attributes that lead to successful institutional collaborations and the establishment of sustainable networks of successful "North-South" scientific partnerships. In addition, we highlight some of the stumbling blocks which tend to hinder the sustainability of long-term "North-South" scientific networks. We use this personal knowledge and experiences to provide guidelines on how to establish and maintain successful long-term "North-South" scientific partnerships.

SO BUILDINGS
AB The public-private partnership (PPP) is a potential procurement strategy for delivering complex construction projects. However, implementing PPPs has not been explored extensively in developing countries like Pakistan. A performance framework is developed in this study to evaluate the application of PPP projects based on 10 key performance indicators (KPIS) and 41 performance measures (PMS). This framework was reviewed by experts for coverage and relevance, then validated through two case studies involving road construction. A triangulation approach was adopted to collect the relevant data through multiparty focus group sessions, archives, and site observations, which enhances the reliability of the data. Results showed there is a difference in performance for six KPIS, but similar practices were reported for four KPIS. The developed performance evaluation framework (PEF) for PPP projects is suitable for developing countries transitioning toward adopting this procurement strategy.

TI An investigation into the sustainability practices in PPP infrastructure
   projects: a case of Nigeria
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose In the global construction industry, the concept of sustainability is not new, particularly within building projects. Against this backdrop, several studies have been conducted, mostly in developed countries, on sustainability in construction projects. However, efforts at investigating sustainability practices in public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in developing countries have received limited attention. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the incorporation of sustainability practices within the context of Nigeria's PPP infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey, which targeted four different types of stakeholders, was conducted in this study. These stakeholders included public sector authorities, concessionaires, consultants and banks undertaking PPP infrastructure projects in the Lagos State, Nigeria. The data collected were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean score, standard deviation (SD) analyses and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Findings The findings of this study revealed that all the respondents are very much aware of sustainability principles and the vast majority of the respondents from the public sector authorities and the consultant organizations confirmed that they have incorporated sustainability requirements into their bidding documents for PPP infrastructure projects. The study revealed sustainability features in the three aspects of sustainability, namely, economic, environmental and social factors. Furthermore, the study revealed the top three-ranked economic factors of sustainability (considered to be the most important factors) were low maintenance costs, whole life costing and supporting the local economy, respectively. Similarly, the study revealed the top three-ranked environmental factors of sustainability were biodiversity, energy use during the operation stage and energy use during the construction stage, respectively. Furthermore, the study further revealed that the top three-ranked social factors of sustainability were the educational aspect, equity between stakeholders and health and safety, respectively. Practical implications The study will be of great value to PPP stakeholders involved in sustainability decision-making processes when delivering sustainable PPP projects, particularly in Nigeria. Also, the study's findings are important as not many empirical studies have been conducted on the sustainability practices of current PPP projects in Nigeria. Originality/value The study's findings would further inform the need for both the public and private sectors to take a more strategic approach to enhance sustainability in PPP projects.

Participants were 9 students, from the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability and Kanazawa University. Field destinations were divided to the next sectors: renewable energy sectors, urban waste power plants, landfills, recycling facilities, water purification sectors, wastewater management and energy plants, local forestry, city port and fishery, sustainable organic agriculture, traditional crafts and educational sectors of the City. At the end of the course students gave their feedback and recommendations for each sectors. Fieldworks showed the strong interconnection between each sectors, and their sustainable cooperation was clearly observed. Public education was strongly emphasized in each sector. However, several questions were raised after the fieldworks; 1. If such kind of sustainable city model can be implemented for developing countries 2. What will be the main obstacles to achieve sustainability there 3. How can conservation and responsible utilization of natural resources, balanced in sustainable manner. In the future we plan to create the educational fieldwork models for each sustainable sectors, which are practiced in Kanazawa City and implement them as an experimental model in the developing countries.

TI Establishing a High-Quality Congenital Cardiac Surgery Program in a
   Developing Country: Lessons Learned
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Background:Developing countries are profoundly affected by the burden of congenital heart disease (CHD) because of limited resources, poverty, cost, and inefficient governance. The outcome of pediatric cardiac surgery in developing countries is suboptimal, and the availability of sustainable programs is minimal. Aim:This study describes the establishment of a high qualityin-situpediatric cardiac surgery program in Lebanon, a limited resource country. Methods:We enrolled all patients operated for CHD at the Children's Heart Center at the American University of Beirut between January 2014 and December 2018. Financial information was obtained. We established a partnership between the state, private University hospital, and philanthropic organizations to support the program. Results:In 5 years, 856 consecutive patients underwent 993 surgical procedures. Neonates and infants constituted 22.5 and 22.6% of our cohort, respectively. Most patients (82.6%) underwent one cardiac procedure. Our results were similar to those of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) harvest and to the expected mortalities in RACHS-1 scores with an overall mortality of 2.8%. The government (Public) covered 43% of the hospital bill, the Philanthropic organizations covered 30%, and the Private hospital provided a 25% discount. The parents' out-of-pocket contribution included another 2%. The average cost per patient, including neonates, was $19,800. Conclusion:High standard pediatric cardiac surgery programs can be achieved in limited-resource countries, with outcome measures comparable to developed countries. We established a viable financial model through a tripartite partnership between Public, Private, and Philanthropy (3P system) to provide high caliber care to children with CHD.

TI Challenges and opportunities for the recycling industry in developing
   countries: the case of Sri Lanka
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The paper identifies why the recycling industry is deficient in Sri Lanka from the viewpoint of the integrated sustainable waste management model (ISWMM). ISWMM identifies from a broad perspective the complex and multi-dimensional challenges and solutions in the recycling industries in developing countries. The focus of this study is on all types of recyclable waste generated by all the actors in a developing economy well beyond the commonly focused municipal solid waste. Data were collected from interviews, document analysis and site visits. The challenges for the recycling industry stem from various upstream and downstream actors in the recycling value chain (broadly stakeholders), waste system stages and enabling environment. Sri Lanka, far from being a circular economy, faces many social, environmental, and economic problems. They need remedial action based on these challenges through awareness creation, capacity building, investment in infrastructure and technology, law enforcement and policy implementation, international collaboration, private-public partnership, fiscal policy support, and industry formalization. Thus, the solutions call for a multi-faceted and all stakeholder-inclusive approach.

AB After identifying decentralized cooperation, its fields of action, changes in its procedures and the ambiguities it faces in supporting sustainable development in developing countries, we focus on sustainable development policies and programs based on more conventional forms of cooperation. However, the decentralized governance of natural resources and environment promoted by these conventional forms of cooperation is facing many difficulties, particularly in Madagascar. Decentralized cooperation can be complementary but its conditions for success depend, among other things, on the success of decentralization processes in the South.

AB The UNU School for Land Administration Studies aims to promote the role of land administration worldwide for good governance in developing countries. A key component of the mandate of the School is to develop a worldwide network of academic partners. Each partner in this network contributes with complementary knowledge and experience, yet distribution of this knowledge to local capacity building institutes and curricula requires a mechanism to deliver content, skills, methods and approaches in a sustainable and student-centric way. To address this challenge, this paper discusses the design and the first experiences with e-learning courseware and activities within the network. The testbed of e-learning design concerned a module on land information infrastructure. Developing the teaching material and teaching approach with the other partners in the network was operationalized through a project, whereby the module was incrementally developed to an e-learning shared module with an e-learning environment. The results so far show that the incremental approach (in contrast to a radical change) meant that certain components migrated immediately to e-learning units, while other components remained initially conventional. This incremental approach not only had pragmatic advantages in terms of the resources needed for courseware development, but also allowed more time for interaction, testing and customization with partners in the network. We conclude therefore that developing e-learning courseware has enabled the network building among partners who build capacity in land administration. This network further enables combining and complementing both global and local knowledge and thus promotes the role of land administration worldwide for socio-economic development in developing countries.

TI How blockchain technology can be a sustainable infrastructure for the
   agrifood supply chain in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB Purpose This study aims to formulate a conceptual sustainable framework for developing a trusted, reliable, scalable, transparent, traceable and sustainable agri-food supply chain in a developing country so that it minimizes wastage and increases the efficiency levels of agri-produce and its usage. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a rigorous review of extant literature, case studies and the interview method for theory building, using blockchain technology (BT) as a subject. Further, the study builds a framework to relate blockchain solutions to the challenges faced by the agri-supply chain. Notably, the use of BT in the agri-food supply chain is a relatively new area of study. Findings Limitations of using BT 3.0 in a diverse supply chain like the food sector, especially in a developing country such as India, may be overcome by adopting BT 4.0 and could change the country's face by controlling inefficiencies and ensuring transparency, helping in good governance, improving the humanitarian supply chain and integrating the bottom of the pyramid to the main economy. Based on the findings, this study proposes BT 4.0 for the agri-supply chain in India to deal with the current issues of demand-supply gap, wastages of agri-produce, unequal distribution of profit among agriproduct producers and logistics suppliers and ensuring sustainability. Research limitations/implications Results in this study have been derived from a specific demographic condition in India. Future research with other demographic conditions may be replicated. BT is a new technology product, and its effectiveness is yet to be established. Practical implications The outcome of this study provides the application of BT 4.0 in the area of the agri-food supply chain. The BT 4.0 framework has been developed on studying a few cases that either implemented BT or were in the testing phase. The benefits of the agri-food supply chain vis-a-vis its overall social well-being may be achieved on the successful implementation of the framework, despite existing complexities in the food supply chain. Further research on this subject may help the other dimensions of the complexity of adopting BT 4.0. Both practitioners and policymakers from developing countries can, therefore, use the findings of this study to analyze BT 4.0 and address the concerns of the agri-food supply chain. Originality/value This research paper has proposed a conceptual framework of BT 4.0, which is a completely new technology. It is fairly transparent, and therefore sustainable supply chain practices may be achieved easily.

AB In developing countries, there are many humanitarian engineering opportunities ranging from healthcare to agriculture, water, sanitation, and energy. The governments in some developing countries, including the Dominican Republic, often focus on industrial and economic development in larger cities. Consequently, remote villages become more isolated, relying on limited local resources and traditional practices to sustain daily living. The situation, however, creates opportunities for non-profit groups to support the ongoing work of organized community initiatives and begin new regional developments. This paper reports a partnership model and project implementation strategy employed in a case study for El Cercado, a rural town located in southwestern Dominican Republic. Over two years, the engineers from the University of San Diego had partnered with El Cercado community to establish more fuel efficient and safe cooking methods, improve drinking water sources, provide an affordable solution to water heating for sanitary purposes, and invent ways to minimize fuel costs. The next challenge is to transfer these technologies to local Dominicans, and assist them in developing business models for long-term sustainability. Advantages and challenges to local development initiatives such as cultural barriers, social acceptance, community leadership, and economic certainty are also presented.

TI An exploration of green supply chain practices and performances in an
   automotive industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB During recent years, the natural environment has become a challenging topic that business organizations must consider due to the economic and ecological impacts and increasing awareness of environment protection. Globalization and the increased number of countries entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) have promoted green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in manufacturing organizations. GSCM has emerged as an important organizational philosophy and a proactive approach to reduce environmental risks. Increasing pressures such as stricter regulations, increased community, and consumer pressures, and the developing country's aim to enter the WTO have caused automotive supply chain managers to consider and to implement GSCM practices to improve both their economic and environmental performances. This paper explores the practices and performances of the GSCM based on the GSCM literature, and it considers the relationship between green supply chain practices (initiatives) and performance outcomes. In this paper, two questionnaires were developed and a survey conducted to assess the importance of GSCM practices and performances in an automotive company in a developing country using a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making method. The result of this paper presents practical guidance for managers in performing GSCM practices by ranking GSCM practices according to their importance which leads to improving GSCM performances.

SO MCGILL INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT LAW AND POLICY
AB The global AIDS crisis has highlighted the impor tance of expanded and sustainable access to lowercost, generic medicines in realising the development aspirations of many low-and middle-income countruies. In 2003, WTO members decided to relax a restriction in the TRIPS Agreement ostensibly to permit countr wis h insufficient pharmaceutical manufacturing capaciiy to make effective use of compuory licensing by importing generics. Canada and a handful of other Jurisdictions have implemented that WTO decision, but none of these gmes have yet been used to supply any developing country with any medicine. While Canadas law suffers from a number ofiatures that hinder its usefulness, more fundamentally he flaw lies in the underlying WTO decision. 7h article outlines the relevance of WTO rules on intellectual propery to the global inequity in access to medicines and reviews key developments at the WTO underlying such legislation It then discusses the key features, positive and negative, of Canada' law, and the two initiatives to dae to use it. Finally it presents reforms that would streamline the legislation, making it more likely to meet the needs of both developing country purchasers and potential generic exporters; the alternative regime presented here woul bypass the flawed 2003 WTO decision but remain TRIPS-compliant.

AB A large number of photovoltaic systems have been installed in developing countries around the world during numerous projects. The goal is often to improve the quality of life in rural areas often lacking electricity. Many of these installations provide important services such as lighting and charging of various devices. However, when the projects are finished, there is a large risk that maintenance is not carried out properly and that malfunctions are never repaired. This situation can leave an otherwise well-functioning system unusable. A key problem is that there are not enough trained technicians that can maintain and repair the system locally. One reason for this is the lack of practical education in many developing countries. Furthermore, the availability of spare parts is essential for long term effectiveness. During 2011 a group of researchers from Lund University in Sweden built a small scale laboratory in Maputo, Mozambique, with local researchers. The project was successful and today the laboratory functions both as a teaching facility and as a measurement station for solar energy research for licentiates, masters and Ph.D. students.
   The main goal now is to widen the project in order to incorporate more universities in developing countries. We are now looking for new interested partners in developing countries who believe that such a laboratory could strengthen their ability to teach practical work and to perform research at a local university. Partners for planning and executing the project are also needed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Support to the Basic Sciences in Developing Countries: Importance of
   Scientific Networks
SO ASIAN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The International Science Programme (ISP) at Uppsala University, Sweden, since 1961 has been devoted to long-term support for building capacity in scientific research and higher education in developing countries in the Basic sciences. An increased domestic capacity for research and higher education in the Basic sciences has a long-term impact on development. In the larger perspective support to the Basic sciences is generally low or neglected, despite their importance for sustaining applied sciences and quality science education. Regional and interregional cooperation may be a fruitful approach to overcome many constraints, adding value to participating scientists and their institutions. Therefore, ISP support to regional collaboration and the formation of scientific networks was initiated already in the early 1980s. Currently, nine chemistry networks are supported, in the fields of analytical chemistry, biotechnology, environmental chemistry, natural products chemistry, and technical and analytical support and training. The activities carried out by the networks are diverse. For support to networks to continue in the future the demands will increase to demonstrate benefits, added value, achievements, impacts, and sustainability.

TI Financial challenges of immunization: a look at GAVI
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Securing reliable and adequate public funding for prevention services, even those that are considered highly cost effective, often presents a challenge. This has certainly been the case with childhood immunizations in developing countries. Although the traditional childhood vaccines cost relatively little, funding in poor countries is often at risk and subject to the political whims of donors and national governments. With the introduction of newer and more costly vaccines made possible under the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the future financial challenges have become even greater. Experience so far suggests that choosing to introduce new combination vaccines can significantly increase the costs of national immunization programmes. With this experience comes a growing concern about their affordability in the medium term and long term and a realization that, for many countries, shared financial responsibility between national governments and international donors may initially be required. This article focuses on how GAVI is addressing the challenge of sustaining adequate and reliable funding for immunizations in the poorest countries.

TI Research capacity strengthening in the South
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Active promotion of evidence-based decision-making at all levels of the health field is a necessary step in the direction of improving the health of the population. Recent studies have shown that the burden of disease in developing countries is high particularly the burden of infectious, communicable and non-communicable diseases and health problems of mothers and children. There is presently, a mismatch between this increased disease and health burden and the technical and human capacity of developing countries to use existing knowledge and to generate new knowledge to combat these diseases and health problems. It is therefore necessary to assist developing countries to build indigenous research capability so they can undertake studies in their own national settings the results of which will lead to the development of appropriate control strategies in their countries. Building indigenous research capacity will enable developing country scientists to translate results of studies carried out elsewhere into their individual national settings. Eventually results of such studies will increase the global knowledge base about the particular health problems and contribute to finding appropriate solutions to them. The research will, finally, increase knowledge-based decision-making by their health leadership of the country. This paper has set out to describe some experiences in capacity strengthening over the last few decades and to propose from these, mechanisms for building these capacities in a sustainable manner.
   This paper has described the steps in capability strengthening with special emphasis on identification of trainees, their training and deployment on return. The paper has described mechanisms of research sustainability including creation of suitable career structures, remuneration of researchers and the importance of building up suitable infrastructure for research to meet increasing demands and competence. The place of partnerships South-South, South-North and networking has been stressed. Finally, the paper calls for greater involvement by policy makers in developing countries in the entire capacity building process. They should set highly focussed research priorities, identify competence not already existing and proceed to fill these gaps along the lines described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Investing in vaccines for developing countries How public-private
   partnerships can confront neglected diseases
SO HUMAN VACCINES
AB This commentary discusses the barrier of vaccine price on sustainable immunization programs in developing countries and offers examples of new mechanisms driven by public-private partnerships to overcome issues of affordability. These mechanisms include Advance Market Commitments with vaccine manufacturers, which take a demand-pull approach to ensure increased production of available vaccines or development of new vaccines for neglected diseases. A second approach applies a supply-push mechanism, such as technology transfer to developing-country manufacturers. A public-private partnership that set long-term, maximum public-sector pricing to increase access of a Japanese encephalitis vaccine for the developing world is highlighted. Lessons learned from this experience can be applied to address common obstacles to new vaccine introduction in resource-limited countries, including issues of affordability, manufacturing capacity, equity in access and quality assurance.

TI Essence and resolution of international climate negotiation
SO ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB In essence, international climate negotiation is a serious and responsible global effort, despite various conflicts, to establish a rational international climate regime. In essence, tackling climate changes is leading the globe to actualize sustainable development of all humankind along the low-carbon, green, and cyclic-development path. Thus, climate negotiation should be driving all parties to achieve a global climate regime arrangement in a constructive way. Therefore, this paper suggests focusing on the following three major recommendations: early developed countries take the lead in committing positively to absolute emission reduction; the developing countries contribute according to their abilities and stages of development; the developed countries perform real deeds using their funds and technology. Based on substantial breakthrough that would be made, progressive supplement and improvement could be accomplished through the mechanism of review and adjustment under the Convention framework. This path represents a combination of bottom-up and top-down. The ultimate way out of international climate negotiation lies in win-win cooperation. Profound reasons for China to participate proactively and practically in international climate negotiation, based on its actual conditions, are the internal wants and needs of its scientific and sustainable development, as well as the undertaking of international responsibilities as a responsible, large, developing country.

TI Carbon performance of firms in developing countries: The role of
   financial slack, carbon prices and dense network
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In this article, we explore how financial slack, carbon prices and dense network of partners influences the carbon performance of firms in a developing country context. Based on the regression analysis of carbon offset market activities of South Asian cement manufacturing firms during the observation period 2005 to 2012, we find that the availability of financial slack has a positive effect on carbon performance. Contrary to expectations, this relationship is negatively moderated by carbon prices, so that the carbon performance of companies with greater financial slack is higher when carbon prices are lower. We find that the firm's dense network of partners positively moderates the relationship between financial slack and carbon performance, emphasizing the influential role of intermediaries operating in the carbon market. Contrary to current thinking on climate policy, our study reveals that lower rather than higher carbon prices, where the firm has a dense network of partners as well as financial slack available, results in better emissions performance.

TI Operator models for delivering municipal solid waste management services
   in developing countries. Part A: The evidence base
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This article presents the evidence base for operator models' - that is, how to deliver a sustainable service through the interaction of the client', revenue collector' and operator' functions - for municipal solid waste management in emerging and developing countries. The companion article addresses a selection of locally appropriate operator models. The evidence shows that no standard' operator model is effective in all developing countries and circumstances. Each city uses a mix of different operator models; 134 cases showed on average 2.5 models per city, each applying to different elements of municipal solid waste management - that is, street sweeping, primary collection, secondary collection, transfer, recycling, resource recovery and disposal or a combination. Operator models were analysed in detail for 28 case studies; the article summarises evidence across all elements and in more detail for waste collection. Operators fall into three main groups: The public sector, formal private sector, and micro-service providers including micro-, community-based and informal enterprises. Micro-service providers emerge as a common group; they are effective in expanding primary collection service coverage into poor- or peri-urban neighbourhoods and in delivering recycling. Both public and private sector operators can deliver effective services in the appropriate situation; what matters more is a strong client organisation responsible for municipal solid waste management within the municipality, with stable political and financial backing and capacity to manage service delivery. Revenue collection is also integral to operator models: Generally the municipality pays the operator from direct charges and/or indirect taxes, rather than the operator collecting fees directly from the service user.

TI Community-based rainwater harvesting (CB-RWH) to supply drinking water
   in developing countries: lessons learned from case studies in Africa and
   Asia
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB This paper uses pragmatic findings and lessons learned from three case studies to deduce that community-based rainwater harvesting (CB-RWH) is an innovative solution to develop sustainable drinking water supply systems in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. Taking advantage of traditional community-based activities in African and Asian villages, the water supply system can be significantly improved with the introduction and implementation of CB-RWH systems. Furthermore, sustainable, safe water sources in Africa and Asia can be brought to fruition when transparent self-regulatory management systems are supported through comprehensive design and maintenance guidelines and funded from private and public sources. To this end, the potential for CB-RWH to lead toward greater resilience and sustainability was investigated. Based on case studies of three successful demonstration projects in Africa and Asia, this paper identifies 14 innovative solutions resolving technical, economic, and social problems which have been barriers preventing the wide implementation of CB-RWH in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. It also recommends strategies to promote CB-RWH in African and Asian villages, which include the following: implementation of more pilot projects at local levels; promotion of and education in rainwater preservation and harvesting at all levels of the education system; and innovation in micro-funding systems in cooperation with corporate social responsibility activities. These strategies will promote the implementation of CB-RWH as a mainstream and high-priority technique for national, regional, and global water strategies.

   STRENGTHENING SYSTEMATICS IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The biosystematic crisis in the developing world is occasioned by the inadequacy of indigenous capabilities; the withdrawal of free-services by the major world centres of excellence; and the ever-increasing need for biosystematics to support sustainable agricultural development and use of biodiversity. Developing countries are unable to meet their obligations, as signatories, to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The most cost-effective and technically best solution is to establish and sustain realistic self-reliance in biosystematics within developing country sub-regions, through mobilization and pooling of resources for optimum use, and their enhancement through donor-funded human resource and capacity building programmes. BioNET-INTERNATIONAL as a global technical cooperation network comprized of inter-linked sub-regional LOOPs (Locally Organised and Operated Partnerships) provides a sustainable mechanism for achieving this objective. Its initial concern with Invertebrates and Microorganisms is without prejudice to its ultimate scope. The first LOOP, CARINET was established for the Caribbean sub-region in December 1993 and LOOPs for East Africa, South East Asia and South Pacific are underway. The world-wide network is expected to be in place within five years.

AB In the wake of the failure of the inward-looking development policy during the 1970s, Bangladesh embarked on a substantially greater globalisation of its economy in the early 1980s through export promotion and removal of import-restrictions. The endeavour has had a remarkable impact on the growth of labour-intensive manufacturing exports from Bangladesh, which in turn has contributed to GDP growth. This paper observes that Bangladesh's export regime rests on a domestic incentive structure that is highlighted by market distortions and, therefore, is inherently weak. Over the years, Bangladesh's export sector has been the beneficiary of a range of favourable conditions such as the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) facilities. The phasing out of these facilities from 2005 as spelled out in the GATT (1993) and WTO (1995) accords, and the corrections of domestic market distortions will have serious impact on the long-term growth of Bangladesh' exports. The paper also underlines that extreme reliance on a single export item namely, textiles and readymade garments, the lack of export-market diversification, the absence of backward linkages to the readymade garments, the high import-content of the apparel industry and the lack of innovation may render Bangladesh's present export-regime highly susceptible to external shocks and/or competition from other developing countries.

AB Road network investment in emerging countries has not been able to keep up with demand. As a result, developing methods for managing the road network, including effective project programming to make the best possible use of limited money, has become increasingly vital. However, in the 1960s, the World Bank initiated model developments to guide investment decisions on road infrastructure in developing nations, which gained traction since most of these investments are supported by donor agencies. A significant issue in introducing these models or systems in developing countries is the lack of a comprehensive priority subsystem as a program and monetary planning tool. The essential functions of such a tool are to detect the network status at various points in time, empower requirements identification, and evaluate multiple policies on a temporary but detailed basis within the context of network management. This paper presents a practical and comprehensive system to deal with the above problem. The paper's Geographical Information and Road Asset Management System (GIRAMS) is a Web-based integrated system that provides enhanced operational efficiency for road funding agencies and their implementation partners in the proper management of the road networks and ancillary infrastructures. The subsystem, Advanced Road Asset Management (ARAMS), was developed to conform to the interface of HDM-4, RONET, and RED for Economic Analysis. In addition to these subsystems, the RAMS is enriched with analytical tools such as Asset Valuation, Budgeting, and Multi-Year Work Programming. In addition, predictive models such as Road Deterioration and Work Effects Models were also built into the ARAMS.

TI Solid waste collection by the private sector: Households' perspective -
   Findings from a study in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB The issue of poor solid waste management (SWM) is a challenge throughout the world, in both developed and developing countries. People always generate solid waste through their daily activities. This solid waste needs to be properly managed in a way that minimises risk to the environment and human health, which means storage, collection and proper disposal. At the same time solid waste creates livelihoods for the urban poor in terms of employment and business. This paper looks into one aspect of SWM, namely collection service.
   The importance of SWM is now recognised at international, national and community level. The Agenda 21 declaration of the United Nations [UN. (1993). The global partnership for environment and development: A guide to agenda 21 (pp. 88-94). New York: United Nations] addresses the issue of environmentally sound management of solid waste, with emphasis on the extension of solid waste service coverage to all urban and rural areas worldwide.
   SWM is a service for which local governments are usually responsible. However, due to inadequate capacity in the public sector, in many developing countries the private sector has stepped in to fill the gap in service provision. Dar es Salaam (DSM), Tanzania, is one such developing country city in which the private sector has become involved in solid waste collection services. The sector comprises Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), Community-Based Organisations (CBOs), and local private companies [Kassim, S. M., & Ali, S. M. (2003). Private solid waste collection SERVICE, Dar es Salaam Tanzania. In Proceedings of the 29th WEDC international conference: Towards millenium development goals. Abuja Nigeria, Water and Engineering Centre WEDC]. The private sector in solid waste collection in DSM has been promoted by Sustainable DSM Programme (SDP) through Environmental Planning and Management (EPM) [UNCHS. (1994a). Sustainable Human Settlements Development: Implementing Agenda 21; UNCHS. (1994b). UNCHS (Habitat) Activities; New Envoy to UNCHS from the United Republic of Tanzania. Habitat News, 16, 1-3].
   Contracting out of solid waste collection services to the private sector has emerged to fill the gap in service delivery. In 1991 the city was generating 1400 tonnes of solid waste per day out of which only 5% was being collected. Currently daily solid waste generation is estimated at about 2500 tonnes and approximately 48% of the total waste generated is collected. At present, privatisation covers 44 out of 73 city wards, and 451 active registered private companies are involved [Chinamo, E. B. M. (2003). An overview of solid waste management and how solid waste collection benefits the poor in the city of Dar es Salaam. Solid waste collection that benefits the poor, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Collaborating Working Group on Solid Waste Management in Low and Middle-Income Countries (CWG)]. This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the households' perspective on solid waste collection services provided by the private sector. The study showed that the solid waste collection service by the private sector is greatly influenced by households' attitudes and behaviour. Their participation, demand for service, awareness, satisfaction level and views on cost recovery are important in the sector. The study concludes that the above factors would be superior if customers (households) were more involved in the planning and decision-making. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Best management practices for corporate, academic and governmental
   transfer of sustainable technologies to developing countries
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Innovations with respect to technologies that contribute to environmental sustainability have emerged within national government laboratories, international agencies and within academic research institutes. Since each of these entities is understandably more focused on ab initio research, conceptual development and proofs of concept, the production level manufacturing and broad dissemination of such technologies require development of best management practices (BMPs) for effective partnerships with and/or technology licensure to private sector industry. Alternatively, certain technologies that address specific environmental sustainability needs within the developing countries can be and have been transferred directly, either through bi-lateral transfers or through multi-lateral agencies, serving as intermediaries. The appropriateness of such transfers is contingent upon host country environmental, cultural and socio-political conditions, the type of technology involved, the "terms of transfer" and the relationships established between the technology conceivers and the end-users. The authors select examples of identified modes of sustainable technology transmission and derive experiential BMPs, which may be of some utility for future sustainable technology transfer. Moreover, in providing these BMPs, the historical record and contemporary caveats with respect to unregulated technology transfer, whether sustainable or otherwise, to developing countries and the array of corresponding proposed codes of conduct are examined, given the normative objective that such technologies should ultimately contribute to ecologically benign and societally beneficial objectives, such as environmental sustainability, equitable growth and poverty alleviation. These issues and the need to establish BMPs would be broadly relevant with the new focus on climate change-related technology funds and associated regional impact projects evolving across the globe and within the developing countries in particular.

TI Accountability and governance in implementing the Sustainable
   Development Goals in a developing country context: evidence from
   Tanzania
SO ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper examines the accountability and governance mechanisms and the challenges in a multi-stakeholder partnership seeking to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a developing country (DC), namely Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on work on the shift from government to governance to meta-governance to examine the SDGs framework's governance regime. The data stems from documentation, focussed group discussions and face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders involved in the localisation of SDGs in Tanzania. Findings Despite the emphasis given by promoters of SDGs on the need for multi-stakeholder engagement, and network and market-based governance, Tanzania's hierarchical governance framed in national legislations dominated the localisation of the SDGs. The national-level meta-governance structures were somewhat dysfunctional, partly due to a lack of well-designed coordination mechanisms for collaborative engagement with key stakeholders. The limited involvement of different meta-governors, and particularly network and market-based governance arrangements, has had severe implications for achieving the SDGs in DCs in general and Tanzania, in particular. Practical implications The paper calls for a more explicit SDG policy and strategy, alongside strengthening institutional structures and related governance arrangements in Tanzania, to promote the realisation of the SDGs. For the SDGs framework to succeed, the authors suggest that, in addition to adopting SDG friendly policies, the Tanzanian government should devise plans for financial resources, strategies for empowering and engaging with key stakeholders and promote an integrative governance system that underpins accountability at the local level. Originality/value Focussing on Tanzania, the paper sheds light on how context in DCs, interactions between state and non-state actors, modes of governance and accountability mechanisms shape the localisation of SDGs and realising the SDGs' agenda. The implementation in Tanzania focussed on priorities in the development plan, thereby neglecting some important SDGs. This raises doubts about the possibility of meeting the SDGs by 2030. The localisation of SDGs remained within the top-down governance structure, as Tanzania's government failed to enact the policy and strategy for multi-stakeholder partnership consistent with the SDGs' principle of "leave no-one behind". Consequently, meta-governors' efforts and ability to monitor and demand accountability from the government was constrained by the political context, the governance system and regulations enacted to side-line them.

TI Improving Cooperation among Farmers for Communal Land Conservation in
   Ethiopia: A Public Goods Experiment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farmers in developing countries depend on communal natural resources, yet countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are facing the severe degradation of communal lands due to the so-called "tragedy of the commons". For the sustainable management of common resources, policy interventions, such as farmer seminars, are necessary to ensure high-level cooperation among farmers for land conservation. However, the effects of this type of information provision are not well known. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the dissemination of conservation information on collaborative communal forest management using an economic field experiment with 936 farmers selected by random sampling from 11 villages in the northern Ethiopian Highlands. We conducted a public goods game experiment using a framework of voluntary contribution to communal land conservation with an intervention to remind participants about the consequence of their behaviors. The results show that the volunteer contribution increased after the intervention, and thereafter the decay of the contribution was slow. The results indicate that providing information about the consequences leads to a higher contribution. The effects of information provision are heterogeneous in terms of social condition, such as access to an urban area and social capital, and individual characteristics, such as wealth. These findings imply that information provision effectively improves farmer collaboration toward natural resource conservation in developing countries.

TI Can't three tango? The role of donor-funded projects in developing
   fisheries co-management in the Tam Giang Lagoon system, Vietnam
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB It is assumed that the partners in co-management negotiate their arrangements themselves and deal directly with each other. However, in Vietnam, fisheries co-management did not begin this way. This paper analyses the influence of international donor funded projects on the development and sustain ability of fisheries co-management systems in the Tam Giang-Cau Hai lagoon system, Vietnam. The findings indicate: (1) the development of co-management systems in these lagoons was led by donor funded projects; (2) the implementation approaches and exit strategies of the donors have affected the sustainability of the co-management systems; (3) the low participation of government in developing the co-management processes has resulted in poor cooperation between the projects and low integration of the projects' resources; and (4) the government has failed to develop "ownership" of co-management to become a true partner in co-management. Although technical and financial support from donors is essential for starting co-management systems in developing countries, this support does not necessarily ensure the ownership and sustainability of these systems. Policy and "know how" for developing and maintaining co-management systems are important for long term sustainability of co-management. This study also raises questions around the role of government in integrating and coordinating the resources of external agencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapias Project: Impact and Lessons
   Learned
SO SUCCESS STORIES IN ASIAN AQUACULTURE
AB In response to challenges that the developing world confront on food security and malnutrition, the last two decades have witnessed increased efforts in genetic improvement to enhance production traits of commercially important aquatic species. From the 1980s to the present, several institutions in developing countries have been engaged in such R&D activity and it is recognized that the collaborative program on Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapias (GIFT) has spurred the development of several tilapia and carp breeding programs that now exist in numerous developing countries. The GIFT is a collaborative R&D program conducted by the WorldFish Center (formerly, International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management, ICLARM) and its partners from the Philippines and Norway aimed to develop methodologies for the genetic improvement of tropical finfish of aquaculture importance. The GIFT project has demonstrated that selective breeding is a feasible, cost effective, and sustainable approach to the genetic improvement of tropical finfish, and also confirmed the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that enabled the assessment of economic viability, social acceptability, and environmental compatibility, thus, creating confidence among planners and administrators, all of which facilitated the transfer of research findings to farming systems in a host of countries. The program and its successors, such as the International Network on Genetics in Aquaculture (INGA), demonstrated that networking and partnership building among national institutions in developing countries, advanced scientific institutions, and regional and international organizations can play a major role in accelerating research and the success of R&D.

TI Synergies between veterinarians and para-professionals in the public and
   private sectors: organisational and institutional relationships that
   facilitate the process of privatising animal health services in
   developing countries
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB The delivery of veterinary services in most developing countries was, until recently, considered to be the responsibility of the public sector. However, over the past four decades, economic constraints and the imposition of structural adjustment policies (SAPs) have led to a gradual decline in public sector investment in real terms and thus a reduction in the quality and quantity of services available to livestock keepers. Many governments acknowledged that they were no longer able to provide services that were essentially of a 'private good' nature and introduced radical policy changes which sought to introduce the concepts of a market orientated approach towards agriculture and livestock production in particular. The role of government, in the future, would be to provide a reduced range of essential 'public good' services and to create a favourable environment in which the private sector could become established as a provider of 'private good' services and at the same time act as a partner in carrying out certain public functions under contract or 'sanitary mandates'.
   In almost all developing countries, however, these policy changes were not accompanied by appropriate development strategies. The reasons for this are complex. Firstly, SAPs may be considered to have been foisted upon governments by donors and are thus perceived by many policy-makers as the cause of financial problems, rather than a solution to them. Secondly, most animal health senior policy-makers in the public sector have been trained as veterinarians and lack the required management skills to plan change effectively. Furthermore, as regards clinical veterinary service delivery, especially in rural or more remote areas, the solution fostered by donor investment, which involves deregulation and the deployment of privately operating para-professionals, is often perceived as a threat to the veterinary profession and might result in limiting access to international markets for the trade of livestock and livestock products. An informal delivery system has gained a foothold in many developing countries in the absence of a well-planned strategy for the privatisation of animal health services. Most governments would now acknowledge that this presents a greater risk than the deployment of well-regulated and effectively supervised para-professionals.
   This paper explores some of the principal challenges facing policy-makers in their efforts to bridge the transition from full state provision of animal health services to the formation of a partnership with the private sector. Governments and donors need to take active steps to facilitate the process of privatisation of animal health services, especially those targeting the poorer rural subsistence and pastoralist farming systems. This would entail an initial investment in developing the necessary management skills at all levels in the delivery system. Thereafter, further investment would be required to allow the changes to be managed using tools such as the strategic planning cycle.
   Should sufficient resources be made available to allow the full participation of all stakeholders in the delivery of animal health services, appropriate institutions and effective organisational relationships addressing all the more important issues will have to be identified.
   The paper then proceeds to describe how different livestock production systems determine the level of demand for animal health services. If these services are to be provided on a financially sustainable basis, they must be tailored to meet actual rather than perceived demand. Identifying an appropriate model for animal health service delivery thus requires careful analysis of the production system to be targeted. Governments and donors can play a useful role in providing resources for this type of study as well as for appropriate market studies, business planning, training and access to soft loans.
   Finally, as regards regulation, as the law stands today, many activities currently practised by para-professionals are classified as 'acts of veterinary medicine or surgery' and may only legally be performed by qualified and registered veterinarians. The concept of 'principal' and 'subsidiary' legislation provides the necessary flexibility in the regulation of the delivery of animal health services to accommodate the rapid changes taking place in this environment today.
   Deregulation involves the delegation of responsibility for the performance of a defined range of veterinary interventions to para-professionals under the 'supervision' or 'direction' of a registered veterinarian. The author illustrates how the experiences of a number of projects in Tanzania were used to propose a definition of 'supervision' in law. The definition offers an opportunity to overcome the fear of compromising standards of delivery of animal health services through the deployment of para-professionals. In addition, such functioning provides employment opportunities for private veterinarians in rural areas where access to formal primary animal health services would otherwise be denied and may contribute to the process of quality assurance of national veterinary services in developing countries.

TI Pro-poor concessions for sustainable water services
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB Most of the billions of people without drinking water or sanitation are very poor While private-sector companies are becoming increasingly involved with infrastructure provision in developing countries, their contracts for water and sanitation services tend to forget the social aspects of providing services to poor people. As such, public-private partnerships in particularly poor countries are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term and UN targets for improvements will fail to be met. Based on a four-year research project in Asia, Africa and Latin America, this paper explains how concession contracts need to be more suited to the needs, resources and aspirations of local impoverished communities-in other words, to be more pro-poor.

TI Drivers of eco-innovation in developing countries: the case of Chilean
   firms
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Despite the growing literature on the drivers of eco-innovation, few studies analyze it in developing countries. Therefore, to fill this gap, this paper aims to analyze the influence of different groups of drivers of eco-innovation (technology push, market pull and regulatory push-pull) on two types of eco-innovations: Resources Efficiency and Sustainable Sensitiveness, differentiating between varieties of innovation-product and process-and between the novelty degree-incremental and radical-. The empirical analysis is built using multivariate probit models and considering a sample of Chilean firms in the period 2009-2016. Results show a displacement of open innovation drivers when a developing country is analyzed; Collaboration with Partners, Alliances and Networks, along with the Non R&D Embedded are predominant technological push strategies in this analysis. Furthermore, Market factors would have a driving effect on eco-innovations, while the Public Support is weakly significant.

AB Current approaches for capacity building in Health Informatics (HI) in developing countries mostly focus on training, and often rely on support from foreign entities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive and multidimensional capacity-building framework by Lansang & Dennis, and its application for HI capacity building as implemented in a higher-education institution in Kenya. This framework incorporates training, learning-by-doing, partnerships, and centers of excellence. At Moi University (Kenya), the training dimensions include an accredited Masters in HI Program, PhD in HI, and HI short courses. Learning-by-doing occurs through work within MOH facilities at the AMPATH care and treatment program serving 3 million people. Moi University has formed strategic HI partnerships with Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (USA), University of Bergen (Norway), and Makerere University (Uganda), among others. The University has also created an Institute of Biomedical Informatics to serve as an HI Center of Excellence in the region. This Institute has divisions in Training, Research, Service and Administration. The HI capacity-building approach by Moi provides a model for adoption by other institutions in resource-limited settings.

TI SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE: SPECIAL
   CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB In the United Nations Millennium Declaration and Millennium Development Goals ('MDGs'), UN Members resolved to address the special needs of small island developing states ('SIDS'). One part of this is ensuring that the international trade regime contributes to their development. These issues have been discussed both in the UN system, as part of the implementation and review of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, and in the World Trade Organization, primarily through the WTO Work Programme on Small Economies. This article examines proposals made in these contexts to enhance the competitiveness of SIDS in a free global market and their effective participation in the multilateral regime. Responses to these proposals show some willingness to provide assistance to SIDS, but resistance to the recognition of further exceptions for certain subcategories of developing countries, reflecting larger debates about special and differential treatment for developing countries in the WTO. It is concluded that if, as seems likely, limited recognition of SIDS needs will be provided within the trade regime, the international community must take its assistance commitments seriously, and it will be beneficial to maintain linkages between SIDS trade issues and the broader context of the MDGs.

AB Coastal zones provide considerable benefits to society while at the same time human activities exert pressure on coastal ecosystems, therefore threatening those same benefits. To promote the sustainable use of coastal zone resources many countries have introduced Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a mechanism to effectively manage the coastal zone and the conflicts of interest arise from competition for coastal space and resources. However the ICZM initiative to be operational, it needs to be formally adopted and supported by the necessary financial resources. In particular, achieving cooperation and integration between different levels of government to engage an ICZM process is always difficult, requiring financial resources. For this reason many ICZM schemes in the developing countries have failed at the implementation stage due to difficulties typically found in most developing countries, such as financial capacity. For instance it has been argued that in the Mediterranean developing countries, financial resources are not sufficient to allow for a thorough implementation of ICZM particularly at the operational stage.
   This paper reviews ICZM process in Egypt focussing on discussing the financial resources to plan and implement ICZM based on interviews with key ICZM actors as well as documentary analysis and participant observation in ICZM meetings. It seeks through a critical evaluation to provide some practical recommendations that could help to enhance the implementation of ICZM in Egypt and other developing countries.

AB The materials presented in this paper are the result of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Advanced Research Workshop on ''Sustainability of Irrigated Agriculture (Sustainability of Water Resources Utilization in Agriculture),'' which was held in Vimeiro, Portugal between 21 and 26 March 1994. The workshop was cosponsored by the Science and Technology for Development (STD) program of the European Union, Centre International de Hautes Etudes Agronomiques Mediterraneennes (CIHEAM) Centre Technique de Cooperation Agricole et Rurale (CTA), Institut Francais de Recherche pour L'ingenierie de L'agriculture et de L'environment (CEMAGREF) and Junta Nacional de Cienifica e Tecnologica (JNICT). The purpose of that workshop was to provide in-depth discussion on irrigated agriculture among researchers and professionals of different disciplines coming from both developed and developing countries. The workshop objective was to integrate existing science and technology into improved irrigation system performance and agricultural water management, and to provide recommendations for future research directed toward sustainability of water use in agriculture. A total of 43 papers were presented and discussed under the following topics: sustainability of world irrigation systems; water management and water policies; sustainability of indigenous water and soil conservation systems; irrigation water management and scheduling; on-farm irrigation systems; irrigation scheme management; sustainability and environment concerns; and technological transfer. The research priorities presented in this paper evolved from group discussions and are based on a common understanding of the challenges that our generation faces to ensure sustainable agricultural development, both in developed and developing countries. The priorities were established by voting of the workshop participants.

AB The beginning of the 21st century brings new thresholds in the field of technology, known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This revolution challenges the limits among physical, digital and biological spheres and, for the first time in history, human intelligence and creativity - things that were considered unique - could be, in time, substituted by robots with artificial intelligence. All of those chances will deeply reshape our way of life, national and global economy and even politics.
   In this article, I will focus on how technology is going to influence developing countries, and I will discuss the case of the Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D). This is a new field of the Development studies, which aims to see how devices or techniques that apply knowledge in order to process or communicate data deliver some aspects of a development agenda in a developing country. As part of the 4IR and ICT4D, I will focus on Blockchain - and on its most relevant example, Bitcoin. This is an emerging technology that strives to add value in economy by eliminating third parties from financial transactions (such as banks) and to reinforce trust between individuals that want to cooperate in a variety of social and economic fields. Consequently, my goal in this paper is to answer the following question: How can Blockchain technology's features help developing countries?
   I will try to answer this question by correlating the development agenda of a developing country (consisting in economic growth, poverty and livelihoods, social development, eGovernance or environmental sustainability) with the most important features of Blockchain technology. Also, for each correlation I will find relevant examples of successfully implemented Blockchain projects. In the final part of the paper I will show how Blockchain can significantly impact the development agenda of each country that has already joined the race for economic, political and social development.

TI Sustainability of Water Safety Plans Developed in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In developing countries, the drinking water supply is still an open issue. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 68% of the population has access to improved sources of drinking water. Moreover, some regions are affected by geogenic contaminants (e.g., fluoride and arsenic) and the lack of access to sanitation facilities and hygiene practices causes high microbiological contamination of drinking water in the supply chain. The Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach introduced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2004 is now under development in several developing countries in order to face up to these issues. The WSP approach was elaborated within two cooperation projects implemented in rural areas of Burkina Faso and Senegal by two Italian NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations). In order to evaluate its sustainability, a questionnaire based on five different sustainability elements and a cost and time consumption evaluation were carried out and applied in both the case studies. Results demonstrated that the questionnaire can provide a useful and interesting overview regarding the sustainability of the WSP; however, further surveys in the field are recommended for gathering more information. Time and costs related to the WSP elaboration, implementation, and management were demonstrated not to be negligible and above all strongly dependent on water quality and the water supply system complexity.

TI The role of multilateral institutions
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES
   A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB In line with its mission of alleviating poverty through support for environmentally and socially sustainable economic development, The World Bank (along with some other multilateral development banks) is working to help developing countries capture a share of the emerging global market in greenhouse-gas-emissions reductions (,carbon trading'). Under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Joint Implementation instrument and the Clean Development Mechanism now provide an opening for substantial international resource transfers and potential for supporting sustainable development through the transfer of cleaner technologies or sustainable forestry and agro-forestry practices. For example, carbon sequestration represents a non-extractive non-consumptive sustainable use of living natural resources that can be incorporated within a multiple-use 'integrated ecosystem management' approach. The World Bank initiated the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) in April 2000, to help spur the development of a global carbon market and to 'learn by doing' how to use carbon-purchase transactions across a range of energy-sector technologies (and some forestry applications) to achieve environmentally credible and cost-effective emissions reductions that benefit developing countries and economies in transition. Building on the success of the PCF ($145 million raised from public and private-sector investors), The World Bank expects to launch two new funds in 2002: the Biocarbon Fund and the Community Development Carbon Fund. These funds will target synergies between carbon markets and objectives such as biodiversity conservation, combating desertification and small-scale community-driven development. Experience from the PCF shows that developing countries can have a comparative advantage in supplying this global market, as emissions reductions can be achieved in developing countries in the range of $345 per ton of CO2 equivalent, compared with a marginal abatement cost of $10-$15 per ton of CO2 equivalent in most countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, realizing this economic potential over the next decade, and targeting the market to the rural poor, will require substantial assistance with project development and government legal and institutional capacity building. Specific needs include raising awareness of the potential of carbon markets at all levels (particularly in energy and land-use sectors), clarifying property rights, particularly in the case of communally held land and resources, ensuring the existence of an attractive investment climate, eliminating policies that create perverse incentives and constraints, and mitigating logistical, political and 'reputational' risks that could deter private-sector investors. It will also be necessary to find ways to reconcile the short-term needs of the rural poor and the typically long-term revenue stream associated with carbon sequestration.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis on the regulation, the applicable law and the tax treatment in the operations of NPOs in developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - A comparative analysis in term of NPOs legal framework governing the formation, existence, restriction and fundraising of NPOs, as well as the tax treatment for the NPOs.
   Findings - The findings suggest that regulations of NPOs in these countries exhibit a mixed picture with respect to the establishment, operation, affiliation and fundraising, as well as their tax incentives and preferences. In some countries, NPOs have fewer restrictions and are eligible for generous tax incentives, while for other countries, various restrictions and lack of incentives are the norms. The legal frameworks for NPOs are burdensome and, to some extent, do not reflect the importance of NPOs as partner for development of society. The findings also suggest that tax treatments in these countries vary from simple to complex coupled with obscure tax exemptions rules.
   Originality/value - Around the globe, authorities and society are increasingly acknowledging the important role of NPOs in dealing with social needs from basic poverty, health and sustainable environments. This study's focus on NPOs regulation will provide an understanding for authorities to design an appropriate framework for the growth and vibrancy of the NPOs.

SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Population and economic pressures necessitate the development of productive yet fragile wetland areas in some tropical developing countries. Owing largely to these same social and economic pressures, expertise for the design and implementation of sustainable development strategies is often limited in developing countries.
   2. Considerable relevant knowledge and experience exist in Europe and North America. Resource constraints limit the availability of this expertise in areas of need in the developing world, despite various international commitments to such cooperation.
   3. Knowledge-based systems technology is well suited for the transfer of expertise from specialists to non-specialist users. It may therefore represent a cost-effective solution for developed nations to honour their commitments to assist developing nations.
   4. SWAMP (Sustainable Wetland Areas Management Project) has been developed to support the National Wetlands Conservation and Management Programme in Uganda. Its purpose is to select appropriate combinations of sustainable uses for wetlands which may be under pressure for development to supply food, tradeable products, or other resources.
   5. SWAMP has the capability to be extended to tropical wetlands in general. in principle, SWAMP's architecture is equally applicable for supporting similar sustainable development initiatives in other types of ecosystem.

TI Inclusive Capitalism and Development: Case Studies of Telecenters

SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES & INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Lack of sustainable approaches for public access venues such as telecenters has led to the emergence of several entrepreneurial and market-driven telecenter models in developing countries that are driven by multinational corporations, governments, and social enterprises. This trend falls under the rubric of inclusive capitalism, which argues that in the contemporary socioeconomic context, private investment and entrepreneurial activities are crucial for economic growth and job creation in developing countries. In this article, I undertake three case studies of telecenters in Bangladesh: a private-sector enterprise developed and operated by a multinational corporation, a social enterprise, and a public-private partnership. The case studies combine a review of organizational documents and an analysis of survey data. While a common feature of all three cases is the reliance on market mechanisms to provide affordable ICT services to the poor, the ndings highlight how the initiatives approach the issue of inclusion differently. This article illustrates the convergence in thinking among various institutional domains of development about the indispensability of inclusive capitalism approaches to bring about socioeconomic development through ICTs.

AB In developing countries, initiatives have often been undertaken in order to fight social and environmental problems. Since the 1990s, an increase can be seen in corporate social responsibility actions, as well as increasingly strong activities by civil society organizations. Tweenty years ago, companies and civil society organizations stood wide apart from each other, with often conflicting agendas and resistance to mutual collaboration. This reality has changed significantly. Besides the phenomenon of cross-sector partnerships, we can also observe the expansion of a particular organization type, i.e., the social business, which combines two objectives that were previously seen as incompatible: financial sustainability and the generation of social value. This article aims to discuss the factors that influence the results of a social business operating in three countries: Botswana, Brazil and Jordan. The results allow understanding the challenges involved in constructing social businesses in developing countries as well as a better understanding of the very nature of those businesses, considering the social realities where they operate.

SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB While technology continues to be seen as a key element in the move to sustainable development, international efforts around technology to support sustainable development transitions in developing countries have failed to yield results congruent with the needs. This review paper aims to contribute to, and help change, the conversation on international technology transfer (ITT) such that it leads to more productive international cooperative efforts for sustainable development in developing nations. We examine ITT in the health, agriculture, and climate and energy areas, juxtaposing it with relevant literature. Supporting domestic and international actors and processes, we highlight what are key elements for success in these areas of action to more effectively implement the SDGs in energy and environment in developing countries. Finally, we suggest that "innovation cooperation" is a better framing than "technology transfer" for advancing international efforts on technology for sustainable development. Such a framing allows for a broader and more comprehensive perspective on technology-related cooperation between countries. It also emphasizes the need for equitable partnerships rather than donor-recipient relationships and for development of local innovation capabilities, leading to more effective marshaling of technologies to help developing countries achieve sustainable development.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Many international aid agencies have been trying to utilize cooperatives as a strategic means for poverty reduction and rural community development in developing countries due to their characteristics, operational efficiency, and effectiveness. However, it is difficult to find a successful case due to various factors. This study tries to propose strategies that the aid agencies and local residents should use for the success of cooperatives in developing countries through an analysis of the success and failure cases of the two cooperatives established under the Saemaul ODA Program in Rwanda. While the length of the ODA program and scale of support significantly affect the cooperatives' self-reliance, what support they receive from the aid agencies and whether it is a long-term support plan considering exit strategies are also important factors of their success. In addition to the support of the aid agencies, efforts of the cooperative members are essential. Cooperatives should reinforce their sense of ownership to achieve the long-term goals of self-reliance and sustainability by setting clear and feasible short-term goals and achieving them one by one through cooperation among members, as in the case of Korea's Saemaul Undong.

TI Hospital management in the context of health sector reform: a planning
   model in Ethiopia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Through health sector reform in developing Countries, Ministries of Health have sought to enhance health care through greater community governance and improved management effectiveness ill their public hospitals. In this paper, we present partnership-mentoring model for enhancing management capacity that has been piloted in Ethiopia and may be useful in other developing Countries. The model included needs assessment and baseline evaluation using a hospital management indicator checklist, deployment of 24 Fellows (US and international hospital administrators) for I year to work as mentors with hospital management teams in 14 Ethiopian hospitals, continuing didactic and practical training in quality improvement methods for hospital management teams, and 24 management improvement projects to be completed during the year with plans for replication more broadly as appropriate. Surveys of Fellows and Ethiopian managers within the first quarter of onsite activity found high levels of trust in one another's abilities and intent to implement changes. The partnership-mentoring model promotes sustainability and may provide other Countries with approaches for improving the quality of hospital care through improved hospital management.

TI On the Legality of the United States Action of Terminating India's GSP
   Status
SO FOREIGN TRADE REVIEW
AB Since the US Presidential Proclamation terminating India status as a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) beneficiary with effect from 5 June 2019, questions are raised on the WTO legitimacy of such an action. The US measure, which appears to have a punitive element-a move precipitated by lack of reciprocity from India by not providing 'equitable and reasonable access' for US products in Indian markets-challenges the fundamentally premise of the GSP schemes. Since the GSP schemes are established to provide economic and developmental opportunities for developing countries, and once established must be administered as per the 1979 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Enabling Clause, meaning it must be on a 'generalised', 'non-reciprocal' and 'non-discriminatory' basis, can India raise a legitimate challenge against the US action at the WTO Dispute Settlement Body? Or can the GSP schemes, being voluntary and unilaterally administered, be structured by developed countries as trade policy tools with stringent trade and non-trade conditionalities? The decision of the Appellate Body in European Communities-Tariff Preferences, the contested nature of the Enabling Clause and the heterogeneous nature of developing countries at the WTO makes the interpretation knotty. In this context, this article provides a brief comment on the legal basis of the Enabling Clause in the WTO framework and the legitimacy of the US action of termination of India from the beneficiary status. Keeping aside the legal question, the author is also of the view that time is ripe for India to consider 'graduating' itself from such preferential arrangements and engage in binding obligations that are reciprocal and sustainable.

TI Examining the determinants of green innovation adoption in SMEs: a
   PLS-SEM approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Currently, environmental and social concerns have made green innovation more popular among researchers and practitioners around the globe. Developed countries tend to focus more on this issue, compared to developing countries. However, the reality shows that small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered as high contributors to environmental pollution. This study is designed for, and conducted on, SMEs in a developing country, Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main determinants of green innovation adoption in SMEs in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach A data sample of 288 SMEs from five different sectors was collected and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. Findings The results of the study indicate that organizational and human resource factors, market and customer factors, and government support and technological factors have a positive and significant impact, whereas external partnership and cooperation, and rules and regulatory factors have an insignificant impact on green innovation adoption in SMEs in Pakistan. Originality/value The outcomes of the study have important implications for managers as well as for government policy makers regarding framing better policies to promote green practices in SMEs.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Drug Discovery in Developing Countries:
   The Example of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
SO ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The current drug discovery paradigm has failed to address the treatment need for diseases of high priority to developing countries. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a good example of such diseases with virtually no new effective drug developed in the past 70 years. The past two decades had witnessed relatively increased attention toward neglected diseases by stimulating pharmaceutical industries through introductions of Priority Review Vouchers (PRVs) and Product Development Partnerships (PDPs). However, the lion's share of resources allocated for research and development by PRVs and PDPs is directed toward research organizations and pharmaceutical industries in developed countries. This new approach has also not led to the development of drugs for most neglected diseases including cutaneous leishmaniasis. Improving the medical discovery capacity of countries where these diseases are prevalent and enabling exploration of the hitherto untapped natural resources are an effective and sustainable solution.

TI Rural surgery: Experience of Niger with the creation of "Capacity of
   District Surgery Diploma"
SO BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB Niger, a developing country, needs durable and sustainable solution for its lack of manpower in surgery and obstetrics. in rural areas, representing 70% of the population.
   Surgery in rural areas began in 1974 with the creation of "travelling surgical camps" concept in order to respond to the high rate of hernias and hydroceles within rural population. As a high-cost activity, this concept was abandoned. However, in 2005 the Faculty of Health Sciences of Niamey, in close collaboration with both the Ministry of Public Health, technical and financial partners (i.e., Belgium and Italian Cooperation, World Health Organization and Word Bank) set up a training program for general practitioners in "Capacity of District Surgery" (CDS). The training program provides a diploma after 12 months and takes place in 2 phases: theoretical and practical work performed in Niamey University Hospital within a 3 months period, followed by 9 months on the site of practical training, essentially conducted in Regional hospitals identified as having all the adequate infrastructure and surgeons able to provide the best training for the students. Targeted students are General Practitioners working in public administration.
   The teaching program is based on basic surgical techniques, behaviors to be used with the most common surgical and obstetrical pathologies in district based on experience gained from travelling surgical camps.
   Getting the CDC diploma leads to increase in salary. Since the creation and availability of this Diploma, 157 doctors have successfully completed this program. According to a study conducted from 2006 to 2010, District doctors performed 18,441 surgical operations in 21 District hospitals with 51.8% in emergency and 48.2 in elective surgery.
   The district surgery concept has proven to be a very effective and valuable tool in the management of emergencies and common surgical pathologies in rural areas. It is indeed a short-term training model that can serve as an example in developing countries. (C) 2021 l'Academie nationale de rnedecine. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI A state-of-the-art review of water diplomacy
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Diplomacy is the art and skill of managing international relations through negotiations between representatives of states or agencies. Water diplomacy is an innovative approach and strategic tool to resolve water issues at local and trans-boundary scales when water conflicts rise in sharing water resources. Complex water supply and sharing issues arise from the existence of multiple stakeholders such as agriculture, industry, urban and domestic users, environmental use, and others competing for scarce water. Water diplomacy may contribute to solving a variety of water conflicts and in this sense is a tool for sustainable water resources management. This paper presents a review of water diplomacy focusing on various themes such as the vitality of water as a resource, virtual water, water conflicts, international water law, and management of trans-boundary waters that are reviewed in this paper in the context of searching for cogent water diplomacy strategies. This work's findings show that conflicts about trans-boundary waters are more common in developing countries than in developed countries. The latter countries have developed trans-boundary agreements, which may serve as guidelines to developing countries in some cases. Virtual water may prevent future water conflicts by reducing water demand and water stresses and providing suitable conditions for negotiation between countries. Capacity building, training in cooperation, and negotiation are means of averting water conflicts.

TI Empirical Examination of Factors Influencing the Adoption of Green
   Building Technologies: The Perspective of Construction Developers in
   Developing Economies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study seeks to better understand the determinants of green building technology (GBT) adoption intention of construction developers in developing countries. In order to address these objectives, this study integrates the Diffusion of Innovation theory, the theory of Resource-based View, and the Resource Dependence Theory to analyze and construct the theoretical model of developers' intentions to adopt GBTs from three perspectives, namely, technological, organizational, and environmental. The model was tested using survey data collected from 142 experienced managers in Vietnam. Data analysis was performed by SEM using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. The findings show that perceived GBT advantages, perceived GBT disadvantages, top management leadership, government support, project partners' green building readiness, and social demand of green buildings are the significant factors that affect GBT adoption intention by developers. However, organizational GBT resource and GBT market readiness have no significant effect on developers' GBT adoption intention. Theoretical and practical implications and limitations of the research are discussed, and suggestions for future research are also proposed.

TI Sustainability and Waste Imports in China: Pollution Haven or Resources
   Hunting
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Motivations behind a country's importation of waste are categorized into the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) and the resource hunting hypothesis (RHH). The importation of wastes can lead to environmental sustainability concerns, requiring governments to intervene when the market fails to reduce the negative externalities by strengthening and implementing environmental regulations. Motivated by China's position within a rapidly growing but environmentally damaging sector of trade, this paper has three goals: (1) to classify the primary hypothesis that governs China's flow of traded wastes; (2) to verify the heterogeneous impact of the pollution paradise motivation and resource demand motivation of waste imports from developed and developing countries, and across industries; (3) to assess the impact of domestic environmental regulations on the motives behind China's waste imports. Using 28 imported waste-varieties from 20 of China's major trade partners across 24 years, findings indicate that the flow of Chinese waste imports is relatively unresponsive under the pollution haven effect. However, the resource hunting effect from developing countries is significantly greater than what originates from developed countries, despite the laws of 2011 and 2017 established to restrict resource hunting activities. These results have important implications for improving the efficiency of China's waste sorting and recycling systems.

AB Over the past few decades, global financing for development has changed dramatically. The growing importance of emerging economies in the world economy calls for a paradigm shift in development cooperation and the pursuit of new, more inclusive partnerships to maximize the impact of all sources of development finance. New forms of South-South cooperation (among developing countries) are gaining ground by bringing to the table not only additional financial resources to fill critical funding gaps (such as in infrastructure) but also developing countries' own knowledge and experience in addressing development challenges at home. The recent decision of Government of India to establish a separate division of Development Partnership Administration within Ministry of External Affairs reflects plans for expansion of India's assistance to developing countries and its firm commitment for timely delivery and effective implementation of its programmes. A new paradigm is clearly discernible in South-South cooperation, for which India's active role needs to be crystallized. A conference to deal in depth with these questions was planned for 14-15 December, 2013 in Pune, India at which leaders, senior officials, eminent academics and experts in the area of development from a number of countries was expected to take part. The Symbiosis Institute of International Studies (SIIS) was proud to announce this conference, in collaboration with the MEA, GOI, wherein constructive dialogue will contribute in shaping the contours of this evolving agenda. The objectives of the Conference were: (i) To provide a platform for academicians, researchers, corporates and policy makers to delve into the multifarious aspects of development partnerships; (ii) To present an opportunity to look into how India's role in the development landscape has evolved over the past decade, and as a provider of development assistance, what are the distinguishing features of India's development partnership approach; (iii) To discuss different ways in which India's corporate sector has engaged in Asia and Africa; what has been the role of the government, and; how can the civil society be effectively engaged in the same; and (iv) To facilitate discussion of partnerships for inclusive development, especially with the objective of innovating South-South Cooperation.

TI Co-production: what makes co-production work? Evidence from Pakistan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - In developing countries there is a growing recognition that co-production offers more cost effective and responsive service delivery options in low income areas. The purpose of this paper is to explore the way co-production initiatives are managed in developing country, Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative comparative case study design is used. Data are collected through 25 semi-structured interviews and document analysis and applies institutional analysis and development framework for analysis.
   Findings - The study suggests that challenges to co-production are more than a managerial problem which require a different set of capabilities on the part of the actors in order to achieve anticipated goals in the joint production of services. Co-production initiatives require formal structures and processes to involve the local community and third sector to work with the public sector as effective partners. Political and bureaucratic commitment in regional and local government and community willingness to engage act as a catalyst for the successful management of co-production.
   Originality/value - The study extends understanding of what makes co-production work, a less researched area on co-production, drawing on a comparative analysis of two different institutional arrangements of co-production.

TI VISITING SCIENTISTS PROVIDE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT LESSONS LEARNED BY POGO
   AND SCOR
SO OCEANOGRAPHY
AB To enable the sustainable use of their ocean resources, capacity for ocean science and observations is important for every coastal nation. In many developing areas of the world, capability for ocean science and observations is not yet adequate to meet management needs. International organizations have employed a variety of capacity development approaches to assist developing countries in building self-sustaining ocean science and observational communities. This article describes the lessons learned from visiting scientist programs conducted for more than a decade by the Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO) and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) that dispatched ocean scientists to developing countries to train hundreds of individuals in a variety of ocean science and observation topics and techniques. From these programs, SCOR and POGO have learned that training in-country has multiple benefits to trainees, host institutions, and trainers, benefits that are not achievable when students leave their countries. These benefits include more cost-effective training on issues relevant to the host institutions using locally available technology, as well as the ability to reach a large number of trainees. Lessons learned from the POGO and SCOR programs can be used to inform the future capacity-development activities of POGO and SCOR, as well as other organizations, to improve, enhance, and expand the use of in-country training and mentoring. Such approaches could contribute to the capacity development efforts of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.

TI Improved cookstove as an appropriate technology for the Logone Valley
   (Chad-Cameroon): Analysis of fuel and cost savings
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Access to modern energy services is still low in developing countries and this lack of access affects in particular the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and sub-Saharan Africa. The large majority of population in the Logone Valley at the border between Chad and Cameroon still relies on wood fuel burnt in smoky and inefficient fireplaces for cooking. The promotion of wood saving stoves locally produced and appropriate for the traditional cooking practices has been implemented by an international cooperation project. Two stove models were compared to the traditional 3-stone fire and a gas stove by Water Boiling Tests and Controlled Cooking Tests. The results showed significant fuel savings thanks to the use of the improved stoves. Data collected during the tests, crossed with information about the local cooking habits, allowed to estimate the impact, in term of money savings, on each household adopting an improved stove. The Centrafricain improved stove resulted being the most performing model occurring in a 25% reduction of the expenditure per family for cooking purposes in a short-medium term. This study witnesses that the use of improved wood stove is likely to be a sustainable way to achieve an appropriate minimum level of energy access for cooking purposes for the poor people in the LDCs, in particular in rural areas.

TI International Cooperation in Developing Countries: Reducing Fatalism and
   Promoting Self-Efficacy to Ensure Sustainable Cooperation
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB International cooperation projects aim to support populations in developing countries or affected by emergency situations and to promote their wellbeing in a coherent way and in line with the 10th Sustainable Development Goal and with the principles of the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development. This study analyzed the ways in which such projects influence two psychosocial variables, fatalism and self-efficacy, which are of great importance in determining the attitude of people to promoting change and improving their living conditions by themselves. The sample (N = 510) consists of adult users of Caritas Italiana projects in developing countries, namely, 161 individuals in Argentina, 123 in Bosnia, 96 in Sierra Leone, and 130 in Sri Lanka. The results indicate that the very fact of being involved in cooperation projects, both economic welfare and social promotion projects, favors a reduction in fatalistic attitudes and that greater perception of self-efficacy predicts a reduction in fatalism. Specific effects are presented in relation to the different cultures, and education levels of the countries analyzed.

TI Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and the complexities of the
   sustainable development goals (SDGs) for countries in the Gulf of Guinea
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The significance of the ocean and the resources that lie beneath it is well represented in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, Goal 14 of the SDGs highlights the need to conserve the ocean, seas and marine resources and, as such, is a significant contributor to the achievement of other SDGs. Goals 1 and 2 are aimed at bringing an end to poverty and hunger of which a plentiful supply of fish is an important means to their realisation. Fisheries also make a substantial contribution to the revenue of many developing countries, thereby assisting the attainment of Goal 8 which seeks to ensure sustainable economic growth. However, the pervasiveness of unsustainable practices that are harmful to the marine environment, such as pollution, overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, threatens the ability of developing countries especially those in the Gulf of Guinea to maximise the use of their ocean resources. The paper focuses on the Gulf of Guinea due to the significance of fisheries resources to littoral communities and the severity of IUU fishing across the region. The paper also emphasises the threat to the fulfilment of some SDGs by 2030. It does so by arguing that unabated IUU fishing is due to respective government's lack of awareness of their maritime domain, reflected in the dearth of human resource and inadequate financial investment to solve the problems of maritime security, and the lack of cooperation between countries in the region thus rendering existing surveillance operations ineffective.

TI Technology cooperation for sustainable energy: a review of pathways
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Policy makers, practitioners and academics agree that addressing climate change requires global efforts and that one pillar of any effective approach must include actions undertaken by developing countries. A key mechanism in which developing countries can be engaged is through collaboration to elicit more use of sustainable energy technologies in a region, organization, or community's energy portfolio. Approaches have tended to emphasize the role of the public and / or private sector. An alternative view has also emerged, termed as community approach, noting the absence of civil society actors in the predominant pathways that often characterize technology cooperation in developing countries. Local engagement is important, as it is often these players [whether local governments, community groups, and/or organizations (e.g. hospitals, schools)] who ultimately reap the benefits and/or bear the costs of these technologies. Recent emphasis centres on an enabling environment, recognizing the importance of creating markets for technology diffusion. Tackling the uptake of sustainable energy in a systematic way, emphasis is placed on policies, actors, and institutions. Building on these foundational frameworks, this paper scrutinizes actors and their relationships with a finer grain to better understand sustainable energy technology uptake. The notion is that sustainable energy technology use will increase with the active engagement of local players (earlier on, in a more meaningful way) in the technology cooperation process.

TI Opportunities to strengthen trade policy for food and nutrition
   security: an analysis of two agricultural trade policy decisions
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Food insecurity and the double burden of malnutrition have emerged as prevailing global health challenges of the twenty-first century. These have been influenced by trade policy decisions, particularly in relation to agriculture, which are highly political and can have large effects on global, national, and local food systems. The aim of this study was to analyse two multilateral trade policy decisions relevant to food and nutrition security, to understand the political and power dynamics in the spaces in which these decisions are being made at the global level, in order to strengthen trade-related food systems governance to improve population nutrition. This qualitative policy analysis drew on data from a targeted literature and policy review, as well as in-depth interviews with eight individuals with expert knowledge and/or involvement in the case studies. The analysis focussed on policy processes and power dynamics, drawing on two frameworks from political science. This study found that power dynamics were shifting, such that developing countries had more of a voice at these multilateral negotiations, and decisions reflected growing resistance from developing countries who were unable to protect their most vulnerable. Contextual factors such as level of food insecurity, socio-economic situation, and historical institutional processes at the World Trade Organisation, were influential in shaping actor agendas. The study suggests that engagement with the historical context of agricultural trade policy, the global spaces in which these policy decisions take place, and creating strong coalitions will be essential to create sustainable and equitable future food systems.

SP EMS
AB In developing countries, and particularly in West Africa, the role of Climate Services (CS) for sustainable development is growing thanks to wide spreading collaboration among European institutions, including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) research centers, universities, and homologue local institutions. Operationally, the implementation of CSs in developing countries is mainly pivoted on NMHS, which, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), are dramatically affected by unmet learning demand.
   The global scale of learning needs for co-development of CSs calls for innovative solutions and a range of flexible modalities to reach learners in a variety of ways, and for sharing resources and successful strategies within the global education and training community. In order to harmonize expected learning outcomes, WMO defined a competency framework (CF) for CSs to be used in the implementation of training initiatives and knowledge sharing tools.
   This paper presents the strategic and methodological approach adopted in the implementation of the TOPaCS, a new knowledge-based distance learning initiative, aiming to provide a flexible learning environment within the CSs CF of WMO ensuring coherence with other WMO education initiatives (Global Campus, other RTCs, etc.).
   The methodological approach adopted is based on the competency-based approach to training, where competencies are composed by elements of knowledge and skill. TOPaCS integrates the WMO CF for CSs into a taxonomy co-designed with stakeholders at different levels, and allows the definition of learning paths, which are a further interactive opportunity for co-development of CSs within the TOPaCS learning ecosystem. Indeed, the approach aims also to guide further instructional strategies and assessments and becomes a starting point to build a common language enabling a better cooperation and exchange between the different CSs training initiatives.

TI Hospital quality improvement in Ethiopia: a partnership-mentoring model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB Quality improvement efforts are increasingly common in the United States; however, their use in developing countries is limited. We sought to evaluate the impact of a large-scale intervention on several key management indicators through hospital quality improvement efforts.
   Pre-post-descriptive study of 14 hospitals in Ethiopia.
   Six regions and two city administrations in Ethiopia.
   Hospital leaders and management mentors in participating hospitals.
   In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, we implemented a countrywide quality improvement initiative in which 24 mentors with hospital administration experience were placed for 1 year in Ethiopia to work side-by-side with hospital management teams. We also provided a professional development course to enhance quality improvement skills.
   Presence of 75 key management indicators; reported management skills of hospital leaders by the mentors.
   In pre-post analysis, we found improvement in 45 of the 75 (60%) key management indicators between August 2006 and May 2007. The changes reflected a total of 105 management indicators improved across the 14 hospitals, which equates to a per-hospital mean of 7.5 (standard deviation 5.9) improvements. Reported management skills of hospital leaders improved in several management domains, although their reported confidence in these skills remained largely unchanged.
   Our findings indicate that quality improvement efforts can be effective in improving hospital management in developing countries. Longer follow-up is required to assess the sustainability of the hospital improvements accomplished.

TI Does PPP Matter to Sustainable Tourism Development? An Analysis of the
   Spatial Effect of the Tourism PPP Policy in China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Funding and efficiency have always been important factors that restrict the sustainable development of tourism in developing countries. The PPP (Public Private Partnership) is an innovative model for addressing the above problems and is popular in the sustainable development of tourism around the world. The performance evaluation of tourism PPP is a key step towards promoting the PPP policy and sustainable development. In particular, the analysis of spatial effects that are easily overlooked will help to improve the measure of PPP performance. Based on tourism PPP projects in the PPP database of the Ministry of Finance in China, this paper analyses the spatial patterns and development characteristics of tourism PPP, identifies and measures the impact factors of tourism PPP by virtue of the GeoDetector method, and analyzes the function of PPP in tourism development and governance. The research shows that there are significant spatial disparities in the tourism PPP projects. Although tourism PPP is the result of interactions between multiple factors, what plays a critical role is the financial factor. PPP acts as a policy driver in tourism development in China. It corrects spatial mismatch between tourism resources and factors, eliminates space barriers and promotes the realization of spatial justice of tourism development. This study not only contributes to the improvement of China's PPP policy, but also has implications for PPP policies in other developing countries.

AB Micronutrient deficiencies create a vicious circle of malnutrition, poverty, and economic dependency that we must strive to break. Golden Rice offers a sustainable solution to reduce the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency-related diseases and mortality, a problem that affects the health of millions of children in all developing countries. The technology is based on the reconstitution of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by addition of 2 transgenes. The outcome of this high-tech approach will be provided to end users as nutrient-dense rice varieties that are agronomically identical to their own, locally adapted varieties. This intervention has the potential to reach remote rural populations without access to fortification and supplementation programs. As part of our delivery, strategy, we are partnering with government and nongovernment, national and international agricultural institutions to navigate through cumbersome and expensive regulatory regimes that affect the release of genetically modified crops, and to create local demand for the biofortified rice varieties.

TI Designing effective partnerships for waste-to-resource initiatives:
   Lessons learned from developing countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Cities in developing countries across Asia-Pacific are struggling to effectively manage municipal solid waste (MSW). This is especially the case in secondary cities and small towns, which often face a lack of resources and know-how. Because the waste stream in these cities is usually high in organic content (50-80%) and recyclable materials (10-20%), waste-to-resource initiatives are viable options for sustainable MSW management. Waste-to-resource initiatives that are low-cost, low-tech, decentralised and community-based offer municipalities useful solutions for managing their MSW. However, the sustainability of such solutions depends on a number of key factors, such as the separation of waste at source, the effective engagement of communities and steady and predictable sources of revenue. Using quantitative data and qualitative information derived from field experience, this paper concludes that effective partnerships between a diverse range of stakeholders must be designed and fostered in order to achieve sustainability. The paper provides an analysis of stakeholder roles for the establishment of effective partnerships in four case study cities of Matale and Ratnapura (Sri Lanka) and Kon Tum and Quy Nhon (Viet Nam), where waste-to-resource facilities have been established, and explores the resources of stakeholders and how these can be mobilised to support waste-to-resource initiatives for revenue generation and long-term sustainability.

TI A Comparison of Design and Support Priorities of Nationally Appropriate
   Mitigation Actions
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB In context of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, developing countries are asked to contribute to greenhouse gas control objectives by proposing so-called Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Although the concept provides developing countries with complete flexibility to design NAMAs, a majority of proposals seek international support. This article improves our understanding of the matching of NAMA design and international support by exploring (mis-) alignment between support providers' and NAMA developers' prioritization for NAMAs. The article assesses survey responses from support providers in light of records of NAMAs. We conclude that there is a mismatch between support providers' primary emphasis on systems for measuring emissions reductions and the lack of such provisions in existing NAMA proposals. Furthermore, sector preferences may create structural biases in NAMA support.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Due to the environmental impact associated with the products' use, sustainable design has extended consideration of products' production to consumption. This study puts forward the concept of sustainable design for users (SDfUs). Using related keywords of sustainable design and user-centered design, we identify a total of 447 usable articles published during 1992-2019 from Scopus. Results of bibliometric analysis show that the number of SDfUs articles has generally continuously increased since 2007. The most productive scholars are from the USA, the UK, and China, while the top three organizations are Loughborough University, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and Delft University of Technology. Different focuses of SDfUs appear among developed and developing countries. Green building design has emerged as one key area that uses the concept of SDfUs in developed countries such as the USA and the UK. SDfUs studies in developing countries such as China focus on design for end-of-life products' treatment and disposal. Most SDfUs studies examine how design can contribute to environmental performance through emission reduction and energy saving during products' use, and articles in one of five clusters from co-word analysis explore users' behaviors for sustainable design in the textile industry. This paper is the first study that systematically reviews the literature on SDfUs. It provides valuable insights for scholars in the SDfUs-related fields to identify their research directions and partners. Results on clusters from network analysis also offer practical implications for enterprises to learn from the construction and textile industries.

TI Corporate governance and corporate social responsibility disclosures:
   The case of GCC countries
SO CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of corporate governance (CG) on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures. This is done in the context of firms operating in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and is largely based on the legitimacy theory, although other theories such as principal-agent theory and stakeholder theory are disucssed.
   Design/methodology/approach This study used the annual reports of 147 firms in the GCC countries, drawing on a legitimacy theory framework to determine the impact of CG characteristics, such as management ownership, ownership concentration, independence of board members, duality of CEO and chairman positions and the existence of an audit committee, on firms' CSR disclosures to various stakeholders. Accordingly, the authors developed five hypotheses to examine the above variables and used a data set from Hawkamah - the Institute of Corporate Governance. This study covers a period of six years (2007-2012). The data set had been regressed in a multi-variate regression analysis.
   Findings The authors reported that greater managerial ownership and concentration of ownership have positive impact on CSR disclosures. The findings of this study also show that internal CG mechanisms, such as the independence of board members, the separation of powers, between the CEO and chairman positions and the existence of an independent audit committee, also have a positive influence on CSR disclosures. In addition, the leverage ratio, return on assets, company's size and age emerge as important determinants of CSR disclosures; nevertheless, the company's size and age are statistically not significant. These significant findings corroborate the recent concern with CG in developing countries that brings greater attention to CSR disclousures, as both internal and external CG mechanisms are effective in influencing the CSR practices.
   Practical implications This study fills the gap in literature by providing empirical evidence on the impact of CG on CSR disclosures in a significant region in the emerging economies. Furthermore, it alerts regulators, policy-makers, practitioners and firms' executives in the GCC region and other developing countries to pay more attention to CG reforms and enforcement as well as to increase institutional pressures regarding CSR adaptation.
   Originality/value The study on how CG and CSR disclosures are connected has been limited. This study addresses this research gap and focuses on a region that has often been overlooked by accounting research.

TI A global assessment of structural change in development funding for
   fisheries
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Foreign aid constitutes a significant part of the national income of many developing countries. Fisheries are often of relevance for livelihoods and food security in these countries, so funding aimed at supporting sustainable fisheries can directly contribute to human well-being. In theory, foreign aid is aimed at promoting the economic development and welfare of developing countries and its allocation should therefore be aligned with development needs. However, the aid literature points to colonialism and donor self-interest at national levels as well as in the international arena as important forces shaping aid flows. Using network analytical techniques, this study examines to what extent both the magnitude and structural patterns of Official Development Assistance (ODA) funding for fisheries have changed over time (2002-2016) and what appear to be sources of stability or long-term tie formation in the network. The resulting network demonstrates that short-term ties, typically over a single year, are the norm for fisheries-related ODA, while long-term ties are uncommon. Among donor states, Japan has fostered the greatest number of donor-recipient ties over the entire study period, which in some cases appear to overlap with geopolitical priorities. The existence of historical colonial linkages is a poor predictor for ties that last the entire 15 years under examination; however, they are a strong predictor of shorter duration ties. The analysis suggests that more effort is needed to optimize resource use towards achieving the international development agenda reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Global Poverty reduction has become an important issue nowadays, where according to United Nations; 36 Million people still live in extreme poverty. Poverty is acknowledged to be a major contributor to hunger and malnutrition, lack of health and education, increasing crime, diminishing socio-economic condition and a barrier for sustainable development. In line with the Post 2015 Development Agenda of the United Nations (2015) of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the discussion of poverty has today become prominent especially in developing countries where a vast majority of world's poor people are living.
   This paper reviews some of some articles which discuss poverty and sustainable development of developing countries. The main aim of this paper is to provide an overview of research which has explored poverty in the context of the effectiveness of the attempts to promote sustainable development in developing countries. In Indonesia, as one of many developing countries, the paper shows that the measurement of poverty in Indonesia has become important in order to not only to measure the actual level of poverty throughout the country annually in an objective way, but also to assess the cause of poverty itself. The related design of a realistic strategy of poverty reduction in Indonesia should be based on an integrative management approach which seeks to provide a combination of different services at the community level.

   opportunity for the reform of developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This conceptual framework intends to explore the ethical reasoning behind the necessity of adopting a sustainable development agenda on the strategic level of policy making. The author investigates the ethical obligations to sustainability through a schema of four ethical theories and matching those standards to three levels: economic, social and environmental. The commentary put forward will argue that the ethical reasoning works as a more effective stimulant for countries to embrace sustainable agendas, where the law has so far failed.
   With the sweeping winds of change (Arab Spring) blowing in the Middle East region since the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia followed by the widely idealized revolution in Egypt; this article explains the paradoxical opportunity which developing countries as such hold now in adopting radical change and starting a whole new wave of sustainable strategies, which in the long term will present themselves as a huge leap forward towards a better future.
   Economic and business benefits are linked to a better quality of life socially and environmentally, where the laws have failed to deliver, and ethical reasoning emerges as a powerful tool forward as it did drive the revolutions asking for radical change.

TI Development and climate change adaptation funding: coordination and
   integration
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Within a few decades, tens of billions, and possibly over a hundred billion, dollars will be needed for climate change adaptation in developing countries. In recent international climate negotiations, US$100 billion per year by 2020 was pledged by developed countries for mitigation and adaptation. Even if this pledge is realized, it is not clear that it will generate sufficient funds to address the adaptation needs of developing countries. A majority of what has been identified as climate change adaptation needs could be considered as funding for basic development. In addition, a large share of current development assistance is spent on climate-sensitive projects. With the potential for funding of climate change adaptation to fall short of what is needed and for development funding to continue funding many climate-sensitive activities, coordination of the two funding streams may enable more effective support for both sustainable development and climate change adaptation. Preliminary steps to facilitate such coordination are part of the Cancun Agreements and initiatives by other organizations.

The main findings of the study reviles that Finland is among the global leaders in knowledge-based development and is a forerunner in innovation-centric development cooperation. The motivations behind innovation-oriented development policy are simultaneously altruistic and instrumentalist. Finland seeks to utilize its best innovation know-how to achieve development co-operation. At the same time, innovation know-how is used to emphasize Finland's own innovation brand and to create new business opportunities for Finnish enterprises. Innovation-focused development co-operation projects are sought in the aid-receiving countries and those strengthen Finland's reputation as a high-tech knowledge economy. However, the relationships among the main objectives of development policy are more intricate. Finally, as a recommendation, we suggest that to foster long-term sustainable development of local communities in developing countries through an innovation system, the general concept of innovation systems must be adjusted to local contexts and practises; both bottom-up approaches and local innovations must also be included in innovation-related policies.

TI Financing Options for Green and Affordable Housing (GAH): An Exploratory
   Study of South Asian Economies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Housing is a basic human need and its affordability has become a concern with the exponential population growth, especially in densely populated developing countries. Rapid urbanization, inadequate housing and increasing slums have also brought environmental challenges to urban areas of developing countries. To address such concerns, Green Affordable Housing (GAH) has emerged as a concept with the convergence of ideas and actions of affordable housing and sustainability. This research aims to identify the GAH adoption strategies and the financial options through case study analysis of three South Asian Economies (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and validated the case study outcome by using content analysis approach. The findings reveal that India has made notable progress in establishing a GAH financial market, while Pakistan and Bangladesh are struggling due to a lack of appropriate funds and underrated financial markets. This study further proposed the financing framework to achieve GAH for South Asian economies because the low-income Credit Link Subsidy Scheme alone supporting the adoption of GAH would not be enough. The study provides policy recommendations for using Credit Link subsidies, energy-efficient mortgages, and Public-Private Partnerships for housing investment as effective methods for financingGAH.

TI Shifts in global immunisation goals (1984-2004): unfinished agendas and
   mixed results
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB The turn of the millennium has been marked by a large-scale mobilisation of resources for immunisation programmes in developing countries. The resources have been generated by public and private sector parties collaborating in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). GAVI was formed in response to deteriorating immunisation coverage rates occurring in the late 1990s. GAVI is the latest in a line of vaccine initiatives, which have operated over the past 20 years. This article reviews the five most important global immunisation initiatives that have taken place over those past 20 years. It analyses their origins, shifts in global immunisation goals, identifies key actors, assesses the initiatives capacity to mobilise resources and increase immunisation coverage, and points to possible unintended effects of the initiatives.
   The study argues that shifts in global immunisation goals lead to fragmentation in the implementation of vaccine programmes at the local level in developing countries. It also suggests that global actors involved in the formulation of these initiatives appear to miss opportunities to build on past experiences and fail to learn from previous mistakes. This raises questions about the initiatives' sustainability and relevance to the overall objective of preventing vaccinepreventable deaths. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Review of Sustainable Multimodal Freight Transportation System in
   African Developing Countries: Evidence from Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN AFRICA
AB The importance of transportation in the socio-economic development of nations cannot be downplayed. Intermodal transport has become vital concept for ensuring sustainable freight transport in developed economies but less focused on among African scientific community as it attracts fewer researches and developments. This paper aims to review and promote the development of sustainable intermodal freight transport systems in African developing countries with insights from Ghana. The researchers adopted literature review approach for the global intermodal developments and that of developing economies with emphasis on Africa and Ghana. Transport experts and experienced practitioners' opinions were sought to complement the limited literature on the means to improve intermodal transport and logistics management systems. Authors discovered that some African countries like Ghana potentially posses some relevant multimodal resources such as seaport, waterway, railway and road infrastructures. However, they are not well interconnected to acquire intermodal benefits. Besides, the existing transportation systems were mostly road dominated and frauded with cost-inefficiencies; greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, accidents, high maintenance and service deficiencies. The constraints are lack of skilled labor, limited infrastructure, safety and security problems, limited institutional capacity, poor intermodal transport network and connectivity issues. Some practical measures to improve the lapses in the transport system were highlighted. It was suggested that management of African developing countries must remodify their transport policies to attract investors and transport players. This would strengthen Public Private Partnerships (PPP) collaborations in developing intermodal freight transport and logistics systems.

AB Due to the lack of suitable approaches for sustainable development, over the years, a gap has evolved between the developed and emerging countries on innovation and technological development. At the same time, opportunities for value creation call for a collaborative framework for economic, environmental, and social industrial benefits among multiple countries to achieve sustainable value creation. Based on international cooperation in sustainable manufacturing, existing design and assessment methodologies can be adapted to increase innovation by utilizing the dynamics of competition and cooperation. This paper focuses on bridging this gap by implementing an approach for adaptively transforming the industrial engineering education principles and practices with the associated research methodologies from developed countries into manufacturing systems in emerging and developing countries. To achieve this transformative approach for sustainable development through education and research, developed countries promote their best practice education cultures in emerging and developing countries. Based on the need for technological and managerial methodologies for sustainable manufacturing, the set of capabilities for industrial engineering are analyzed, and educational principles are selected. As an example of the approach proposed in this paper, a new reformed program for industrial engineering merges the needs of the Turkish manufacturing industry with the German application-oriented education and research culture. The educational program guides stakeholders to generate a common understanding and utilize bilateral opportunities for sustainable value creation in manufacturing. (C) 2016 The Authors.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In accordance with the Sustainable Development Goal 17 of improving global partnership for sustainable development, this study examined the effect of foreign direct investment inflows, economic development, and energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions from 1982 to 2016 for the top five emitters of greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion in the developing countries, namely; China, India, Iran, Indonesia and South Africa. The study employed a panel data regression with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, U test estimation approach and panel quantile regression with non-additive fixed-effects. The study found a strong positive effect of energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions and confirmed the validity of the pollution haven hypothesis. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is valid for China and Indonesia at a turning point of US$ 6014 and US$ 2999; second, a U-shape relationship is valid for India and South Africa at a turning point of US$ 1476 and US$ 7573. Foreign direct investment inflows with clean technological transfer and improvement in labour and environmental management practices will help developing countries to achieve the sustainable development goals. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions depends on enhanced energy efficiency, adoption of clean and modern energy technologies, such as renewable energy, nuclear, and the utilization of carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel and biomass energy generation processes.

AB The International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications (ISAAA) is a not-for-profit organisation. The mission of ISAAA is to help alleviate poverty and hunger in the Third World by increasing crop productivity and income generation, particularly for resource-poor farmers, and to create a safer environment and promote more sustainable agricultural development. ISAAA's activities as an 'honest broker' involve the transfer of appropriate crop biotechnology applications and products, particularly proprietary technology, from the North for the benefit of developing countries in the South, by building partnerships between national programmes in the South and institutions in the North. In the past, developing countries and the institutes assisting them with agricultural research accessed non-proprietary traditional technology from the public sector in industrial countries. With the advent of biotechnology this situation is changing, because biotechnology applications are increasingly proprietary and are owned primarily by private sector corporations in industrial countries. The activities of ISAAA in brokering biotechnology applications are described as well as the support services it provides for national programmes in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

SO JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to cover issues raised in the author's plenary address to the Journal of Accounting and Organizational Network Conference held in Melbourne in November 2017. This called for accountants, whether professionals in practice or in academia, to broaden their vision of accounting and accountability beyond the financial accountability of organisations, and serving corporate and capital market interests, to consider how it can help achieve sustainable development goals.
   Design/methodology/approach The discussion is based on personal experience, cognate literature and policies of major global institutions.
   Findings Whilst the need for financial reporting will remain, there is a pressing need for reporting to measure, monitor and make accountable organisations' obligations to help achieve sustainable development goals established by global institutions such as the United Nations. Areas of importance discussed are accounting for human rights, mitigation of climate change, securing decent work, increasing accountability - especially civil society democratic participation - and a greater and more equal partnership with stakeholders and developing countries to address their needs.
   Research limitations/ implications - The paper is a personal polemic intended to provoke reflection and reform amongst accountants.
   Practical implications - The paper outlines the areas where accounting could and has addressed human rights and sustainability issues.
   Social implications - The social implications are vast, for they extend to major issues concerning the preserving the planet, its species, humankind and enhanced democratic processes for civil society and developing countries.
   Originality/value The paper reinforces the need for policy reforms advocated by social and environmental accounting researchers.

SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Apart from economic, political, and cultural cooperation for an equal growth of all developing countries, science and technology are an integral significant component in these levels of engagement for leveraging mutual gains. The current pandemic not only brought about an 180 degrees shift in the relationship between the government, policy makers, and the scientific community but highlights the importance of South-South Cooperation (SSC). SSC may serve as a mode of cooperation to foster the transfer of need-based technologies among developing and least developing countries and open many fronts for mutual sharing in terms of geopolitical, available resources, and expertise. The cooperation under the SSC does not substitute but complements North-South development cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The use of science diplomacy would be an effective tool to bring all the stakeholders of the Global South to a common platform to combat future global challenges. Science policy instruments would need to incorporate scope for international collaborations as a means of furthering the national and global imperatives.

AB Agricultural supply-chain in developing countries has been recognized to have critical complications, e.g., seasonal supply-demand complexity, high emission factor, economic inequality, social conflicts, etc. Thus, it requires a significant transformation to solve its latent problems. This study suggests the transformation by conducting a postharvest engineering by the application of appropriate technology. As an ex-farm strategy, postharvest engineering offers less interventions to any existing process taken by least developing societal groups. In parallel, appropriate technology puts an emphasis on the sustainability of a technological solution by using indigenous knowledge as its basis. Their combination will then transform the whole supply-chain in terms of four different perspectives. Technically, supply-chain complexity requires an interconnected calculation of supply-demand network. Besides, economic value added needs to be redistributed throughout the chain. Next, applying an appropriate technology in conducting postharvest processing will change the life-cycle assessment of a commodity being treated. Then, involved parties in the chain require a renewed partnership to intermediate different interests. In short, this study proposes a notion on a set of comprehensive solutions from different views to solve problematic issues within any agricultural supply-chain in many developing countries.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The management of solid waste has been recognized as the cornerstone for sustainable development and closed loop circular economy models. Moreover, solid waste management is at the forefront of initiatives seeking to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This research stems from the limited success that solid waste management programs have had in the context of developing countries and the need to overcome the obstacles and impediments hampering the implementation of a sustainable solid waste management framework. It aims to facilitate the optimization process of the applied technical, operational, and managerial schemes, streamline sustainable practices and close the circularity gap that currently exists in waste management taking Lebanon as a case example. Accordingly, a performance assessment and optimization tool was developed to evaluate the administrative, environmental, and operational performance of 27 unions of municipalities and large municipalities encompassing more than 90 villages/cities. The model compares different technologies based on a set of user defined constraints and groups municipalities and operational facilities into four classes: (A) Superior, (B) Satisfactory, (C) Poor, and (D) No service. The excessive amounts of disposal rates, failure in the adoption of a comprehensive solid waste management framework, the absence of a contingency plan, and the consistent reliance on ad hoc strategies for handling solid waste characterized the sector in Lebanon. A thorough analysis of the various waste management systems revealed that none could be classified as "superior", with the ratings of most schemes compounded in the lower end of the spectrum.

TI A Systematic Framework for Sustainable ICTs in Developing Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS APPROACH
AB Global warming problem is specified as the most important problem threatening the world in recent years. The primary cause of the problem is claimed to be greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Sustainable ICTs or green ICTs can significantly help to solve the problem in terms of introducing green innovations or applying ICTs to increase energy management efficiency. In addition, they benefit organizations in the aspects of financial, operational, and strategic advantages. Since developing countries are also the members of societies, they should work together with developed countries in problem solving. Nevertheless, these countries face many limitations such as poverty, development, and so on. Therefore, the systematic support from the developed world is crucial to facilitate their contribution. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementing sustainable ICTs. This framework can be applied to both developed countries and developing countries. However, this work specifies more details for adopting the framework in developing countries since they are constrained by economy and growth more than the developed world. This work also highlights the systematical cooperation among developed countries and all sectors of developing countries. This framework can help in speeding up the success of sustainable ICTs adoption in developed countries or developing countries. In addition, the paper describes some research directions to support effective application of the proposed framework.

TI Local actions for the common good: Can the application of the ecosystem
   services concept generate improved societal outcomes from natural
   resource management?
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Nature provides a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) that are vital for human well-being and livelihoods. The supply of these services is being threatened by local and global pressures. Managing for the provision of ES can provide a range of benefits that, in economic terms, can be defined as, ptivate, common or public goods. Inspired by the theme 'local action for the common good' of 7th Ecosystem Service Partnership conference held in Costa Rica, this paper examines the key issues in policy and management for production and management of ES in a way that meet the broader common good. The ES approach is not widely understood by policymakers, the general public and the private sector. While the approach is a promising contribution to providing for common good outcomes from the management of natural resources, much needs to be done to ensure that it achieves the dual purposes of maintaining and enhancing the supply of different services and improving the livelihoods of the rural poor in developing countries. Critical areas for further attention are assessments of ecosystem services in developing countries that incorporate local and indigenous knowledge, clear links to policy and decision making, public education and engagement about the value of ecosystem services and payment mechanisms that drive local actions and contribute to local livelihoods.

TI Addressing the renewable energy financing gap in Africa to promote
   universal energy access: Integrated renewable energy financing in Malawi
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The Sustainable Energy for All Initiative is a global initiative launched by the United Nations Secretary General in 2012 with a goal of providing universal access to modern energy services by 2030. To achieve this goal, substantial financial and technological investments will be required at a rate far exceeding historical levels. Sub-Saharan Africa has a 30.5% electrification rate and policy reform issues to improve electrification have been poorly implemented thereby sprinkling doubt as to whether the region would be able to achieve 100% access to electricity for all by the year 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a tough challenge in-order to achieve universal access to modern energy services since the region fails to attract energy sector investments. There is also a general perception that the region contributes very little to global greenhouse gas emissions hence offers few opportunities to reduce these emissions consequently missing out on attracting climate finance projects.
   A guarantee of power purchase has been shown to attract energy sector investments. However, guarantees of power purchases such as Feed-in Tariffs, are experiencing slow market growth in developing countries because of a range of technical, regulatory and financial barriers. Using Malawi as a case study of a developing country, this review provides a perspective from a Sub-Saharan Africa Least Developed Country as to the various electrification, renewable energy deployment and climate change management challenges that still require urgent attention. This study shows that despite the perceived regulatory and financial challenges, Malawi can integrate and use a combination of (adapted) price guarantee schemes, cross subsidies and environmental taxes in -order to support initiatives aimed at supporting the country's development of renewable energy sources and hence indirectly support the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative.

TI Policy trends of e-waste management in Asia
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper examines the policy trends of electronic waste (e-waste) management in Asia. E-waste is a rapidly growing waste stream in the world today and is estimated to be growing at 3-5 % per annum. Fast paced obsolescence in the electronic sector has resulted in the generation of e-waste. There are concerns that e-waste generated in developed countries is ending up in developing countries especially in Asia resulting in adverse environmental and health impacts. Consequently, a number of countries in Asia are developing policy instruments to ensure the proper management of e-waste. These include e-waste regulatory frameworks, data and inventories, and infrastructure and capacity building. These trends indicate a positive development path towards sustainable e-waste management in Asia. Nevertheless, potential limiting obstacles for e-waste management in Asia may also include an over-reliance on legislation to drive e-waste management or the simplistic adoption of policies from developed countries without taking into context the local political, cultural and socio-economic waste management issues. Consequently, this paper suggest that e-waste policy development may require a more customized approach where, instead of addressing e-waste in isolation, it should be addressed as part of the national development agenda that integrates green economy assessment and strategic environmental assessment as part of national policy planning. In conclusion, policy trends of e-waste management in Asia appear promising provided there is a paradigm shift from an e-waste perception of an environment problem to a e-waste perception of a potential opportunity as sustainable national green growth strategy in Asia.

TI Insurance, Developing Countries and Climate Change
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB By providing financial security against droughts, floods, tropical cyclones and other forms of weather extremes, insurance instruments present an opportunity for developing countries in their concurrent efforts to reduce poverty and adapt to climate change. By pricing risk, insurance provides incentives for reducing risks and adapting to climate change; if these premiums are not affordable to the most vulnerable, donors can combine premium support with risk-reduction measures. In this paper, we examine the costs, benefits and risks of public-private (and donor supported) insurance programmes that offer affordable economic security to vulnerable communities and governments. Insurance mechanisms are of particular interest to climate negotiators seeking strategies that help vulnerable countries adapt to increasing severity and frequency of weather disasters, and we examine the case for including insurance mechanisms in a climate adaptation strategy expected to be agreed in Copenhagen in 2009. We present a proposal for this purpose that has been recently put forward by the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII), which calls for international solidarity for very low probability and high consequence weather-related events (high- risk layer). For middle-layer risks the MCII proposal calls for international support to promote sustainable, affordable and incentive-compatible insurance programmes that serve the poor without crowding out private sector involvement.

TI Renewable energy regulation in South Africa: lessons from the Chinese
   experience
SO COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICA-CILSA
AB The global community is increasingly aware of the problems associated with climate change and sustainable development. The solution to the problems requires the participation of all countries. However, many developing countries have additional, and often competing, priorities, which include poverty eradication and social sustainability. South Africa, as a developing country, faces these challenges and has acknowledged that environmental sustainability is central to its own development and sustainability, and has also recognised the role that renewable energy can play in achieving these goals. The country's abundant renewable energy sources are valuable assets that require a solid and effective legal regulatory system for their optimal use. Despite the acknowledgement of the role that renewable energy will play in the future of the South African electricity market, the regulation thereof is still in its infancy. The People's Republic of China is facing similar challenges to those faced by South Africa and has emerged as a world leader in renewable energy development. South Africa can learn valuable lessons from China, especially in light of the partnership the two countries share in BRICS. This article will compare renewable-energy policy and law in China with the South African framework, with a view to developing lessons that South Africa can use when formulating its own policy.

TI Trends in Income Inequality: Evidence from Developing and Developed
   Countries
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB We use a novel approach to answer questions like: is there a secular trend and shift in inequality across developing and/or developed countries? Do the developing countries converge the inequality level of developed countries? Unlike some recent studies that rely on casual observation of the time series, we conduct recent econometric techniques that allow us to check if there are statistically significant trends and whether these trends are deterministic or stochastic. We also test the inequality gap between developed countries and different developing country groups using convergence test. Using data of 34 countries over the 1960-2020 period, we find that inequality has been either increasing or stable in developed countries; in developing countries, both improvements and deterioration in inequality are observable. We show also that few developing countries reduce the inequality gap with developed countries. These heterogeneous trends suggest that the inequality in the last half-century is driven by national rather than global contexts. Our analysis of the Official Development Assistance and inequality nexus supports this inference.

AB The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)(1) outcomes and action lines can be considered as a guide and as an outline to utilize Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in sustainable development. Developing countries and their respective stakeholders can use the WSIS action lines in drafting national ICT policies and strategies that will lead to sustainable development, social progress and economical prosperity. Therefore, it is important to understand how it can be applied to ICT policies and consequently how can it directs, attracts and creates feasible ICT projects and investments.
   The objective of this paper is to demonstrate and analyze the impact of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) action lines on ICT policies and strategies making it an effective tool toward sustainable development.
   This paper discusses how these actions lines can be included in national ICT policies and strategies. It also discusses the ways these policies may be reformed to provide a better base and platform that can encourage, support and launch effective ICT projects. Furthermore, the paper talks about the positive effects of partnership among all stakeholders; namely governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations, in creating and implementing ICT policies. This partnership can lay down a successful foundation for launching ICT projects and attracting investments in this field.
   It is concluded that the proper utilization of the WSIS action lines into national strategies and policies will turn ICT into an effective sustainable development tool. It will improve the general conditions and living standards of the people in various aspects of life in the developing countries.

TI Interplast Italy: A 20-Year Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
   Humanitarian Experience in Developing Countries
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB Background: Interplast Italy is a nongovernment, nonprofit organization with the aim of providing high-quality standard reconstructive procedures, contributing to local medical and nursing education, in those countries where this is not available or where the local resources are inadequate to meet local needs. A recent debate about the real aim and the effectiveness of this kind of health support strategy in developing countries has been raised.
   Methods: The authors report a 20-year experience, explaining operative strategy, activities, and results, and contributing to the development and improvement of the philosophy of humanitarian missions.
   Results: Since 1988, 47 missions and 5235 operations have been performed. A total of 2286 patients (43.7 percent) were younger than 18 years, and 2949 (56.3 percent) were above that age. Congenital cleft deformity was the most common diagnosis in 2415 patients (46.13 percent). Patients suffering from postburn contractures were operated on in 1956 cases (37.36 percent). The number of postburn children operated on was 922 (17.6 percent).
   Conclusions: Cooperation with local physicians is considered mandatory to guarantee adequate patient preselection, to organize the activity in situ, and to plan continuous effective work on a regular basis to build local capacity and facilitate sustainable models for health care. Furthermore, as local surgeons become interested in reconstructive surgery, continuous teaching through a multidisciplinary approach must be paramount. The activity of Interplast Italy contributed to building a plastic surgery service in Bangladesh. Combined multidisciplinary activities linked to established organizations such as the Interplast confederation are desirable to improve results. A link with structured organizations is needed to obtain financial resources to extend targets and to improve activities and outcomes. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 124: 1340, 2009.)

TI Make the village better: An evaluation of the Saemaul Zero Hunger
   Communities Project in Tanzania and Bangladesh
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB A majority of people in developing countries suffer from chronic hunger due to food crises and poverty. This has attracted humanitarian organizations specializing in addressing hunger, food security and poverty to set up efforts aimed at reducing hunger and poverty among vulnerable communities. This study aims to evaluate the achievements of the Saemaul Zero Hunger Communities Project (SZHCP) of the World Food Program (WFP) implemented by Good Neighbors International (GNI) in partnership with Tanzanian and Bangladesh local governments, which ran from 2014 to 2018 in selected local communities in Tanzania and Bangladesh. The project targeted the most vulnerable communities to improve their livelihood and rural development programs in terms of food security, income generation, education, and infrastructure improvement through community-based activities. To collect information and data for evaluation, we conducted field research such as in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys in the target villages of the SZHCP in Tanzania and Bangladesh. Using qualitative analysis, difference-in-difference estimation, and linear regression on surveys of 1142 respondents, we show that the SZHCP significantly improved the livelihoods of beneficiaries in relation to zero hunger, and also increased income generation and promoted positive social changes. It has also helped to strengthen the capacity of communities to run development projects themselves. This study provides evidencebased analysis that could allow stakeholders and researchers to more fully engage with future community-based projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI FACTORS AND PROCESSES AFFECTING FOOD SECURITY
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF FOOD SECURITY
AB Food security and its ensuring is a process that affects a number of factors. Main factors were defined in chapter 2 -Food availability, food access, food use and stability. Governments can influence the four dimensions of food security, with policies and investments that increase the availability of food sustainability, improve peoples' access to it, ensure that their utilisation results in adequate nutrition, and guarantee stability across those three dimensions. (OECD, 2013) FAO presents classification of factors in terms of food security on a global scale. It is also possible to introduce factors which are divided according to the typology of global problems. The 21st century world is facing a number of complex and interrelated challenges, which have serious implications for the efforts of FAO, its member countries and partners to achieve global food security:
   center dot The world's population is rapidly expanding (it will reach 9 billion by 2050), with most of the growth in today's developing countries.
   center dot Rural-urban migration is increasing considerably, again predominantly in developing countries (urban areas accounting 70 percent of the global population in 2050).
   center dot Changing patterns in the types of food consumed are resulting from economic expansion, globalization and urbanization.
   center dot Natural resources are being subject to unprecedented pressure from human activities. center dot Marked climate and environmental changes are occurring, including more frequent disasters and emergencies.
   center dot Globalization is affecting the agriculture sector and food security, with major implications for the free trade of food and access to markets and information as well as the availability of land for food production and food prices. (FAO, 2011; Ingram et al., 2010)

TI Developing tourism products and new partnerships through participatory
   action research in rural Cameroon
SO GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
AB At present, several obstacles to tourism development have been identified in developing countries. These include: poor infrastructure; shortage of facilities; a weak tourist image; a lack of know-how with regard to how to welcome visitors and market tourism services; and the scarcity of available capital. In the research reported on in this paper, we explore the involvement of microcredit institutions to alleviate these issues. Because tourism is not yet developed in our study area of West Cameroon, action research was considered the only way to validate (by action) the recommendations of both the actors and the researchers. Action research permits the researchers to study the complex issues that typify the management of tourist destinations, including, for example, governance problems. It allows for networking and capacity to change the ways in which actions are carried out. The paper explores possible synergies between microfinance institutions (MFIs) and small and medium tourism businesses in an African rural community. First, we emphasise the obstacles to the formation of partnerships between MFIs and tourism businesses and we suggest ways to minimise them. Second, we describe how we facilitated networking between tourism actors and MFIs, which enabled the development of tourism products through new partnerships. As a result, four businesses are currently operating. From a research perspective, we point out the strengths and weaknesses of different types of associations and list the challenges. The results indicate that asymmetry of information and a lack of entrepreneurial spirit emerge as key concerns. The action research has promoted place and community based development. However, we underline that proper tourism development also requires the participation of stakeholders acting at different spatial scales.

TI Corporate citizenship: creating social capacity in developing countries
SO DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB A corporation has only limited ability to create social capital through philanthropic activity, and, in the context of a decline in official aid, the corporate sector is increasingly assuming a de facto developmental role. The presence of social capital assists communities in moving towards sustainable development and may contribute to the business case for corporate-community partnerships. While it is not the role of corporations to deliver social services, their ability to enhance social capital by partnering with community organisations can contribute both to development and work to their own commercial advantage. Such partnerships, whether philanthropic or commercial, will be more effective if delivered through balanced and transparent relationships with community organisations that help to create social capacity at the local level.

The comparative analysis from the 3 groups of countries, EU members, EU trade partners from Developed Countries and EU trade partners from Developing countries and Least Developing countries presented the different effects they had. EU members obviously gained the benefits from this but not much to the central and Eastern European countries. Moreover, EU also gained more power in trade negotiation since Developing countries and Least Developing countries seeking for EU support to improve their environmental standards and tend to using economic diplomacy to solve problems.

TI Searching for a New Dimension of ODA: Goal Diversity and Trade Revisited
SO JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE
AB The effects of official development assistance (ODA) have been much discussed since the late 1950s, resulting in conflicting arguments. To tackle this issue, this paper examines the diversity of the roles and goals of ODA. The ODA paradigm has evolved from an economic view (1950s-60s), poverty reduction (1960s-70s) and social development (1970s-90s) to sustainable development (1990s-2000s). This paper focuses on examining the effects of ODA in terms of changing goals at different times. To do so, a panel data analysis was conducted for countries receiving ODA and categorized by the OECD DAC from 1960 to 2011(sometimes 1980-2011). The results of analysis show that the diverse effects of ODA on developing countries vary depending on the political (e.g., national transparency) or economic (e.g., income level) conditions of individual countries. For example, ODA is effective for certain countries in poverty reduction (as explained by the integrated development model), while for others, it is more effective in economic growth. Interestingly, national transparency and income level moderate ODA effectiveness and sometimes change the roles and goals of ODA. Furthermore, strategic ODA implementation is expected to enable developing countries to move toward sustainable national development, and make the concept of ownership and ODA for trade more important. Trade can be a powerful engine for growth and development in ODA recipient countries. ODA for trade, accordingly, is expected to help recipient countries use trade more effectively to promote growth and poverty reduction as well as achieve their development objectives. To this end, they need to get ownership from donor countries. To build up ownership, donors need to give ODA to countries with conditions that require improving national transparency or good governance.

TI Trade Measures for Regulating Transboundary Movement of Electronic Waste
SO UTRECHT JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW
AB International trade in used electrical and electronics equipment (UEEE) provides an avenue for socio-economic development in the developing world and also serves as a conduit for transboundary dumping of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) also referred to as electronic waste or e-waste. The latter problem arises from the absence of a regulatory framework for differentiating between functional UEEE and junk e-waste. This has resulted in both functional UEEE and junk e-waste being concurrently shipped to developing countries under the guise of international trade in used electronics.
   Dealing with these problems will require effective regulation of international trade in UEEE from both exporting and importing countries. Although, the export of e-waste from the European Community to developing countries is currently prohibited, significant amounts of e-waste from the region continue to flow into developing countries due to lax regulatory measures in the latter. Hence, there is a need for a regulatory regime in developing countries to complement the prohibitive regime in the major e-waste source countries. This paper proposes trade measures modelled in line with WTO rules that could be adopted by developing countries in addressing these problems. The proposed measures include the development of a compulsory certification and labelling system for functional UEEE as well as trade ban on commercial importation of UEEE not complying with the said certification and labelling system. The paper then goes further to examine these proposed measures in the light of WTO rules and jurisprudence.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This article examines the relationship between growth, emissions, population density, renewable energy consumption, urban population, and climate finance using a panel data for 141 countries between 1990 and 2015. The study revisits the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by focusing specifically on the developing country context. In the first analysis, the growth-emissions nexus is explained with three panel regression models. The second part investigates whether international support for developing countries, particularly climate finance on mitigation, is effective for a subpanel of 103 countries between 2002 and 2015. The EKC hypothesis is generally valid in quadratic specification, while the EKC is largely not found with clustered data and cubic polynomial functions. The effects of mitigation aid vary by dataset, implying that simply increasing mitigation aid may not be enough to reduce emissions in developing countries.

TI Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national
   systematic analysis
SO LANCET
AB Background Government spending on health from domestic sources is an important indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people, and is essential for the sustainability of health programmes. We aimed to systematically analyse all data sources available for government spending on health in developing countries; describe trends in public financing of health; and test the extent to which they were related to changes in gross domestic product (GDP), government size, HIV prevalence, debt relief, and development assistance for health (DAH) to governmental and non-governmental sectors.
   Methods We did a systematic analysis of all data sources available for government expenditures on health as agent (GHE-A) in developing countries, including government reports and databases from WHO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). GHE-A consists of domestically and externally financed public health expenditures. We assessed the quality of these sources and used multiple imputation to generate a complete sequence of GHE-A. With these data and those for DAH to governments, we estimated government spending on health from domestic sources. We used panel-regression methods to estimate the association between government domestic spending on health and GDP, government size, HIV prevalence, debt relief, and DAH disbursed to governmental and non-governmental sectors. We tested the robustness of our conclusions using various models and subsets of countries.
   Findings In all developing countries, public financing of health in constant US$ from domestic sources increased by nearly 100% (IMF 120%; WHO 88%) from 1995 to 2006. Overall, this increase was the product of rising GDP, slight decreases in the share of GDP spent by government, and increases in the share of government spending on health. At the country level, while shares of government expenditures to health increased in many regions, they decreased in many sub-Saharan African countries. The statistical analysis showed that DAH to government had a negative and significant effect on domestic government spending on health such that for every USS1 of DAH to government, government health expenditures from domestic resources were reduced by $0.43 (p=0) to $1.14 (p=0). However, DAH to the non-governmental sector had a positive and significant effect on domestic government health spending. Both results were robust to multiple specifications and subset analyses. Other factors, such as debt relief, had no detectable effect on domestic government health spending.
   Interpretation To address the negative effect of DAH on domestic government health spending, we recommend strong standardised monitoring of government health expenditures and government spending in other health-related sectors; establishment of collaborative targets to maintain or increase the share of government expenditures going to health; investment in the capacity of developing countries to effectively receive and use DAH; careful assessment of the risks and benefits of expanded DAH to non-governmental sectors; and investigation of the use of global price subsidies or product transfers as mechanisms for DAH.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper addresses the question of how business organizations, civil society organizations and government agencies can engage one another for 'boundary-spanning' dialogue and develop mutually beneficial 'working partnerships' in resolving the challenges of sustainable development. Over the past decade the concept of sustainable development has expanded to include the simultaneous consideration of economic growth, environmental protection and social equity in business and decision making. An increasing number of businesses have responded by engaging in corporate citizenship programmes to promote sustainable development. Strategic partnerships between civil society organizations and businesses are widely promoted as important new strategies, which will bring significant sustainable development benefits especially to developing countries. This interaction arises from an understanding of the need for comprehensive and integrated approaches to business, environmental and social issues that involve increasingly broader participation.

Some researchers argue that the SDGs put more emphasis on the value of economic growth, and if so, it would pose a challenging situation, especially to developing countries considering the nexus among economic growth, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. In order to understand to what extent the SDGs advancement accompanies CO2 emissions increase, a study is needed to investigate development pathways of various countries during the past decades. This study aims to empirically identify well-performing countries, in terms of both the SDGs implementation and CO2 emission mitigations, and investigate causes of the difference from the others through the decomposition analysis. The results confirm a good number of well-performers, particularly among the Latin American and the transition countries. It is found that well-targeted policy interventions for expanding the essential public services such as health, education, energy, water, and sanitation, are effective for advancing the SDGs. The decomposition analysis shows that the countries which made significant advancements in the SDGs had tangible positive economic growth effects on their per-capita CO2 emissions. But if policy attention is paid to reduce the energy and carbon intensities, especially in the energy-intensive sectors, such as the industry, energy, and transport sectors, the increases of per-capita CO2 emissions can be minimized. Proper private sector engagements are considered effective to this end.

AB The rise of social movements targeting multinational companies on issues of social and environmental responsibility has generated new global supply chain standards. Tied to the wide range of sustainability standards is the growth of partnerships between multinationals (MNCs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, these standards may unintentionally impose conditions that may exclude small-scale firms in developing countries from global supply chains, thus negatively affecting the poorest developing country producers, from what is known as the "bottom of the pyramid." This article examines how standard making and implementation resulting from MNC-NGO alliances can create conditions that foster inclusion and upgrading of small-scale producers in a supply chain. it demonstrates that including poorer producers from developing economies requires an active assistance approach to address the complex challenges of creating more responsible supply chains.

TI Third-party logistics providers (TPLs) and environmental sustainability
   practices in developing countries The case of Morocco
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the environmental sustainability practices of third-party logistics providers (TPLs) in a developing country and analyze the efforts made by TPLs to implement green practices through a case study of Moroccan TPLs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative case study of Moroccan TPLs was conducted using an interview guide.
   Findings - The findings indicate that the internal and external drivers motivate TPLs to implement green practices while internal and external obstacles hinder them. The authors identified two groups of TPLs, each with a specific environmental sustainability approach. The results indicate also that environmental sustainability is at an early stage of development in Moroccan TPLs. Based on these findings, the authors were able to develop several propositions for further research. It is suggested that TPLs market coverage can influence positively their green initiative; the lack of collaboration and partners involvement hinders TPLs environmental initiatives; and the lack of clear environmental strategy limits TPLs environmental sustainability initiatives.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has some limitations that provide future research opportunities. Because this study is qualitative, further statistical support is needed to justify wider generalization of its findings. The possibility of generalizing the present findings to countries beyond Morocco is limited by the fact that data were collected exclusively there. Studies might therefore do well to investigate TPLs in developing countries other than Morocco to increase the external validity of the results. Also, the research could be expanded by taking into account how shippers or client companies collaborate with TPLs to improve sustainability initiatives.
   Practical implications - The results can be used to inform companies about environmental sustainability initiatives that have been implemented or to identify practices that can be adopted.
   Originality/value - The relevant literature has centered on advanced countries, and few studies have been conducted in the logistics market. Research on the sustainable initiatives of TPLs in developing countries in general and African countries in particular is sparse. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the sustainable practices of TPLs in Morocco.

AB Sustainable development and innovation are not new concepts in developed countries. Global Innovation Index and Global Competitiveness Index systematically rank in top list most developed countries of the world such as Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA, Japan etc. These countries are not simply developed, but they also take care on sustainable development. Referring to World Bank definition, sustainable development means "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1997). It is difficult to talk about sustainable development without explaining the contribution of 'Triple Helix' concept in this kind of development. In general, Triple Helix means a strong cooperation between University, Industry and Government. (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1998). But what happens in a post-transition and developing country (such as Albania) seems to be quite different. In a developing country these three pillars: University, Industry and Government, operates very independent from each other. Furthermore, in some cases, one of them may become an obstacle for two others. The main reason why this happens is related with cultural barriers that come from a long process of being in transition. The paper is a critical analysis, mainly based on literature review. At the end of the paper, there are given some recommendations how to foster the cooperation between these three pillars (university, business, government) in order to offset the negative role of culture in this cooperation, improve the performance of Albania in future Global Indexes and moves the general economy of the country towards sustainable development. Open Innovation Model seems to be a good possibility for organizations in Albania in order to go beyond barriers of culture and to strength their cooperation.

TI The Global Food Industry and "Creative Capitalism": The Partners in Food
   Solutions Sustainable Business Model
SO BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW
AB Rising global food prices have driven 44 million additional people into extreme poverty-and malnutrition-in developing countries since June 2010. Partners in Food Solutions (PFS), a nonprofit social enterprise affiliated with General Mills, is proposed as the conduit for food industry managers, engineers, and scientists to initially advise small- and medium-sized African mills and food processors-and later other developing countries-on improving supply chain management by addressing manufacturing problems, developing products, improving packaging, extending product shelf, and finding new product markets. In this article, the "creative capitalism" model of sustainability and social and environmental responsibility is applied to the food manufacturing industry's efforts supporting PFS. Furthermore, the evolution of the sustainable business model developed by PFS is thoroughly described, explained, and analyzed as a generic model of social enterprise to be "scaled up" by the global food manufacturing industry. A summary of salient points conclude the article.

TI The activation of local service suppliers by incoming tour operators in
   a "developing" destination - the case of Madagascar
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB This article elucidates how organised tourism initiated by the international tour operator system can involve local actors in a developing country with a young tourism industry. The empirical basis is incoming tour operators in Madagascar with the focus on their policies and practices in getting involved with local tour operators and individual providers of service by the realisation of their programs for international markets. The study adopts a qualitative approach based on personal interviews with incoming tour operators located in the capital city of Madagascar. The central theoretical frameworks applied are primarily from the research literature on partner selection and cooperation in exchange relationships (channels of distribution) and contract theory and the results are discussed within in the wider perspective of local competence development and sustainable tourism. The findings demonstrate that incoming tour operators have a quite limited involvement in the cooperation with local actors and uncover the problems linked to partner-specific, local attraction-specific and context-specific factors. The study offers an insight into a field that has been scarcely illuminated empirically by research and it is believed that the results have relevance beyond the geographical context of the research.

TI Climate mitigation policies and actions: access and allocation issues
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB As part of the Special Issue on Access and Allocation, this paper explores how reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide raises a number of access and allocation issues and identifies the possible solutions to the existing problems. The access elements include the right to development and basic needs satisfaction and the allocation issues include distribution of resources, risks and burdens and the assignment of responsibilities. The development pathways for many developing countries will be constrained by national level GHG emission reduction commitments as well as sub-national efforts. Yet, the current level of commitments is not sufficient to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees C. Hence, an important question is what does a decadal review of the relevant literature tell us about how to conceptualize and define access and allocation in the area of climate change mitigation governance? The paper concludes that access and allocation issues of climate change mitigation are inextricably interlinked; calling for holistic\nstrategies for mitigating environmental impacts while addressing social problems. The access issues can be governed through market mechanisms, in combination with an equity and justice approach for the poorest communities, and technology and social innovation, while allocation issues are governed by public policies, institutions, bottom-up decision making, mainstreaming of climate policies and international cooperation. The main characteristics of developing countries have not been adequately incorporated in present-day mitigation models. Further multidisciplinary research is needed to foster efficient and equitable climate, energy and forest governance which should be consistent with sustainable, inclusive and low carbon development pathways.

TI Comparison of environmental impacts related to municipal solid waste and
   construction and demolition waste management and recycling in a Latin
   American developing city
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Construction and demolition waste (CDW) and municipal solid waste (MSW) are the waste flows mostly generated at a global level. In developing countries, most of these waste streams are disposed of in open dumps. Policy-makers should be informed in which priorities should be established in order to improve the quality of the environment. The current research compares the environmental impacts generated by the MSW and CDW management system of La Paz (Bolivia). The aim is to evaluate (1) which environmental impact indicators are more important per waste flow and (2) if recycling can be considered a good option for mitigating such environmental footprint. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of the formal MSW management and the CDW mismanagement (i.e., open dumping) were conducted. The analysis of the management system (2019) is compared with future developments in recycling that counts with the support of an international cooperative project financed by the Italian cooperation. Results reported that, at a municipal level, CDW mismanagement contributes more than 60% to the freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, which represents the most relevant impact generated by this waste stream. Recycling allows achieving avoided impacts higher than the ones produced for three of six environmental impacts, suggesting MSW and CDW recovery as an important option for preventing environmental degradation. The research is the first attempt to highlight the importance of organizing appropriate CDW management systems into an integrated waste management scheme for mitigating environmental impacts in developing cities.

TI A contribution to the implementation of ICZM in the Mediterranean

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) principles in the Mediterranean developing countries at the moment of signing the protocol on ICZM for the Mediterranean, in the framework of the UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan of the Barcelona Convention. This assessment is based on the results of two advanced seminars on ICZM promoted by the Azahar programme of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for the Development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation). The contribution of the participants of the seminar, who are representatives of national agencies related with ICZM in different Mediterranean countries, have been collected through a questionnaire including: (i) a ranking of the main coastal sectors and the main coastal issues of each country; (ii) significant initiatives for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean coastal zones; and (iii) the evaluation of the ICZM progress. The state of the coast, the level of implementation of ICZM and the main problems faced to apply it, have been detected for each country. None of the consulted countries have a full implemented integrated coastal zone management, the major problems being: (i) the lack of financial commitment for the implementation of ICZM; (ii) the lack of an assessment and monitoring system; (iii) the lack of knowledge regarding the coastal system; (iv) the lack of qualified human resources; and (v) the lack of public participation and administrative integration strategies based on information. From these conclusions, some recommendations to improve ICZM are also provided. The work presented in this paper is the starting point to assess the evolution and the reference from which ICZM will be improved through the protocol on ICZM for the Mediterranean.

TI How effective are small-scale energy interventions in developing
   countries? Results from a post-evaluation on project-level
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB In many developing countries large parts of the population are negatively affected by the lack of access to clean and affordable energy. Providing sustainable energy services to these people has been acknowledged as a key component to reduce poverty. One form of development assistance to address the needs of the energy-poor at the local level are small-scale renewable energy projects. Like all development interventions, these energy projects are not intended to produce short-term outputs, but to create long-term impacts. Thus, it has become increasingly important to evaluate and accurately assess their sustainability. But despite the widely recognized need to identify successes factors and explain failure only few studies exist that address the sustainability of small-scale of energy development efforts post implementation. Against this background the paper presents the results of a post-evaluation of 23 projects supported via the Sustainable Energy Project Support (SEPS) scheme of the WISIONS initiative run by the Wuppertal Institute. The analysis provides insights on the influence that socio-economic, environmental, geographic and gender factors can have on the sustainability of small-scale renewable energy projects in developing countries.

TI The Role of Local Actors in Transforming Informal Settlements in Turkey
   for Sustainable Urban Development: The Ankara-Dikmen Valley Case
SO INTERNATIONAL PLANNING STUDIES
AB The question of how to create sustainable cities in developing countries is closely related to the question of how to upgrade and/or transform informal settlements in developing countries. The participation processes and the partnerships of urban actors appear as the key components in upgrading/transforming informal settlements and achieving sustainable practices in urban areas. This paper examines the relations between group of urban actors who took part in a large-scale gecekondu (urban squatter areas) transformation project in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, known as the Dikmen Valley Environmental and Housing Transformation Project. The research points to different actors involved in this transformation process, the dynamic and often conflicting relations and interests among them. Examining the environmental problems that are created due to these relations, the research highlights how environmental concerns were overridden by the political and economic concerns via the "consensus" solutions generated. It is concluded that the decision-making groups, which are the metropolitan government units, tend to dominate the participation process by establishing coalitions with other groups such as landowners and gecekondu owners. The struggles within and between the decision-making groups are also emphasized as having a major influence on generating undesired outcomes for urban sustainability.

TI Unintended consequences of CSR: protectionism and collateral damage in
   global supply chains: the case of Vietnam
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB Purpose - This paper seeks to investigate the influence of the increasingly sustainable sourcing policies of many multinational companies on suppliers located in developing countries such as Vietnam. The focus is the process through which corporate social responsibility (CSR) is reaching this Southeast Asian country.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in Vietnam through the support of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization's (UNIDO) regional office. The survey was based on a questionnaire used during direct interviews or sent out electronically when onsite visits were not possible. The research involved 25 Vietnamese enterprises.
   Findings - The results reveal, on the one hand, how CSR makes business sense even in a developing country such as Vietnam and, on the other hand, the difficulties of maintaining sustainability as products move from northern consumers to Vietnamese suppliers. This process calls for more collaborative models of governance among the companies along the supply chain, local authorities, international players, and civil society at large.
   Originality/value - This paper highlights the unsustainable process through which corporate responsibility is being imposed on Vietnamese suppliers and how CSR, now required for access to international markets, might eventually turn into a new form of protectionism. To avoid this, CSR must be supported, rather than imposed, through building innovative partnerships and through a demand-driven educational agenda.

TI Food security and sustainable use of natural resources: A 2020 Vision
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB At the threshold of the twenty-first century, widespread poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation cause severe human suffering and threaten to destabilize global, regional, and national economic and ecological conditions. If these trends continue unabated, the world will not be a pleasant place to live for most of humanity. The International Food Policy Research Institute has developed a 2020 Vision of a world where every person has economic and physical access to sufficient food to sustain a healthy and pr productive life, where malnutrition is absent, and where food originates from efficient, effective, and low-cost food and agricultural systems that are compatible with sustainable use and management of natural resources. With foresight and decisive action, we can create the conditions that will permit this vision to be realized by 2020. There are several challenges to assuring food security and sustainable use of natural resources: (i) widespread poverty and inadequate human resource development, which inhibit people's capacity to grow and/or purchase the needed food; (ii) large increases in developing-country populations, especially in urban areas, which will substantially increase food needs; (iii) gross under-investment in agricultural research in developing countries and inadequacies in availability of and access to agricultural inputs-such as water, fertilizer, pesticides, energy, research, and technology, which leads to lagging yield increases in more-favored areas and low and variable yields in less-favored areas; (iv) degradation of natural resources-such as soils; forests, marine fisheries, and water-which undermines production capacity; (v) inefficient functioning of markets and inadequate infrastructure as well as weakened capacity of developing-country governments to perform their appropriate functions; and (vi) insufficient domestic resource mobilization-savings and investment-and declining international assistance, which restrains economic growth and development. These challenges can be overcome and the 2020 Vision of food security and sustainable use of natural resources realized if all relevant parties-individuals, households, farmers, local communities, civil society, private sector, national governments, and the international community-take appropriate action and change their behavior, priorities, and policies. Priority actions include investing more in poor people, accelerating agricultural productivity, assuring sound management of natural resources, strengthening the capacity of developing-country governments to perform appropriate functions, and expanding and realigning international development assistance. The world's natural resources are capable of supporting the 2020 Vision, if current rates of degradation are reduced and replaced by appropriate technological change and sustainable use of natural resources.

TI Brazil and its Approach to the Development Assistance
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB This article analyses Brazil's development assistance, which includes scientific and technical cooperation as well as, along with humanitarian aid and participation in peacekeeping operations. Scientific and technical cooperation involves promoting education, health and agriculture, applying new technologies in production and eliminating hunger and poverty in the developing countries. Brazil's policy began with a series of steps, starting with supporting national liberation movements in Africa and Asia, supporting the Non-Aligned Movement, increasing its participation in the North-South dialogue, and contributing to the formation of a new international economic order. Brazil promotes becoming an important instrument of foreign policy, which is based on principles of equal cooperation, respect for international law and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Improving the mechanisms for development cooperation includes making sure aid is transparent, expanding partnerships in promoting development, attending to the needs of developing countries, moving away from direct transfers of money, and attracting and training the population of the recipient country. There are more than 100 federal government institutions in Brazil involved in international cooperation, which reflects the diversification of the country's foreign policy. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays an important role in systematizing the process of cooperation, defining the concept and implementing projects in the framework of bilateral, trilateral and multilateral cooperation and assistance to the countries of the world, especially in Latin America and Africa. For Brazil, promoting development is not limited to exchanging experiences in successful programme implementation, but also includes developing new models for scientific and technical cooperation that are the basis for innovative, complex projects that expand opportunities for national growth, the transnationalization of Brazilian business and increased foreign trade. ABC has been pursuing a new cooperation strategy since 2008 that involves a logical matrix for each project to evaluate the effectiveness of the Brazilian model of development assistance. Brazil's role in promoting development and its transition from donor to mediator is notable.

TI Trade and environment negotiations in the WTO: Asian perspectives
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB For developing countries, aid cannot replace trade. Mutually supportive trade and environmental policies should contribute to the realization of sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to identify the negotiating position of selected Asian developing countries on the World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE). This paper reviews their submissions and suggestions for the CTE with regard to its mandate on trade and environment. In addition, using key trade statistics, it explores the relationship between their negotiating positions and changes in the structure of international trade in Asia. While the CTE has brought about no specific results concerning its mandate, the negotiating positions of developing countries are changing sharply. In particular, Asian developing countries now participate proactively in CTE negotiations. This paper shows the diversity of views held by Asian countries on trade and environment. In some cases, their views are opposed to each other. It can also be observed that the negotiating position of each Asian country at the CTE is closely related to its own trade structure. In accordance with national patterns of trade structure, NIEs, China and India have their own distinct negotiating positions whereas Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries have not taken the same stance in the CTE negotiations. Each member of ASEAN presents separate views depending on the nature of the issue.

TI Tourism governance in protected areas: investigating the application of
   the adaptive co-management approach
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB Protected areas have become popular tourism destinations; yet these areas are often plagued by poor governance systems, particularly in developing countries. Adaptive co-management (ACM) has been advocated as one approach to improve the governance of protected areas, yet empirical evidence from developing countries is lacking. This study investigates the application of the ACM approach in two protected areas in Bangladesh which are also important nature-based tourism destinations. Using Lawachara National Park and Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary as cases, this qualitative study explored the extent to which an ACM approach was able to support the achievement of key governance principles such as participation, accountability, transparency, power, rule of law, and social learning. It was found that the approach was successful in facilitating the increased participation of a broader range of stakeholder groups, and the collaboration between them. Importantly though, it was the adaptive element of ACM which was found to have made the greatest contribution to improved governance with the approach providing new opportunities for stakeholders to engage in iterative learning. This aspect was found to be of particular importance for the sustainability of the protected areas with stakeholders reporting changes attitudes and behaviour towards protected area conservation.

TI Unaligned connections or enlarging engagements? Tertiary education in
   developing countries and the implementation of the SDGs
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Given that tertiary education (TE) is a sector often associated with exclusion, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where only a small proportion of the population gain access, how well placed is this sector to support the implementation of the SDGs? This article extends our reflections from a recent rigorous review of literature, published from 2010, which looked at the role of tertiary education in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The review noted the sparse literature on a range of development outcomes, with limited attention to some of the key themes of inclusion and sustainability associated with the SDGs. Many studies report on some form of limited connection between TE and development outcomes, also drawing attention to contextual conditions beyond TE that contribute to this. The article considers the reasons for these findings, and some of the difficulties of forming conclusions on a still limited base of research evidence. A second theme in the literature reviewed highlights that where TE establishes partnerships, engagements or cross-institutional alliances, joint and valuable learning in support of the SDGs ensues, enhancing practice and building institutions. Some of the implications of these findings for the positioning of TE in developing countries in the wake of COVID-19 are considered.

AB SMILE project is an international education project for engineering students, and implies volunteering activities including aid and support for the local communities in developing countries. SMILE project is built on the basis of engineering member's creative ideas beyond the preconceived and typical engineering education. The purpose of SMILE project is to let local people smile based on the technical support on site. Participants with an engineering major consider the local issues and discuss the possible solutions. This program is managed by the Consortium of Innovation Center for Engineering Education in Pusan National University of Korea (PNU), which comprises 14 universities in the south-eastern region of Korea. PNU is focusing on engineering service learning which educates globally responsible students who can offer sustainable and appropriate solutions to the endemic problems faced by local communities in developing countries worldwide. Since 2009, PNU has been running engineering service learning projects in Indonesia and since 2015 also in Morocco. SMILE project is based on the problem-based learning approach. This contribution presents the case study of the 2017 SMILE project event, which was held in Morocco. Besides the PNU as coordinator, two more universities (one from Morocco and one from Spain) are also part of the event. The aim is to train students to be able to look at problems from different perspectives through various learning processes, including creative invention method, design, team working and results sharing. They learn by project on how to approach a problem differently, rather than be merely taught how to come up with a pre-determined solution to each given problem. The teams help to solve the problems that local residents are facing. The process includes 'deriving a new idea', 'product design', 'purchasing materials', 'making a product', 'writing product description' and 'installing products'. Team managers with engineering majors follow and monitore each team, check all missions at each stage and advice when needed. At the end of the project, students are given the opportunity to evaluate the project activities and focus on their learning from the project. This Self-reflection should cover various aspects including ability to use one's own skills and resources, cooperative spirit, communication skills, self-management, analytic thinking, and global capabilities. Challenges and learning outcomes of the experience are presented.

TI Comparative Studies on Patient Safety Culture to Strengthen Health
   Systems Among Southeast Asian Countries
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Patient safety is an important issue in health systems worldwide. A systematic review of previous studies on patient safety culture in Southeast Asian countries is necessary for South Korea's partnership with these countries, especially given South Korea's assistance in strengthening the health systems of these developing countries. Studies on patient safety culture in Southeast Asian countries, published in English and Thai languages, were retrieved from computerized databases using keywords through a manual search. Data extraction, quality assessment, and analyses were performed using several tools. The review included 21 studies conducted in Indonesia (n = 8), Thailand (n = 5), Malaysia (n = 3), Vietnam (n = 2), Singapore (n = 1), and the Philippines (n = 1). They were analyzed and categorized into 12 dimensions of safety culture, and differences in response rate or scores were identified compared to the mean of the dimensions. The heterogeneous of safety culture's situation among Southeast Asian countries, both in practice and in research, can be explained since patient safety policy and its application are not prioritized as much as they are in developed countries in the priority compared to the developed countries. However, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos are the priority countries for South Korea's official healthcare development assistance in the Southeast Asia region. Vietnam, for instance, is an economically transitioning country; therefore, consolidated patient safety improvement by inducing patient safety culture in the provincial and central health system as well as strengthening project formulation to contribute to health policy formation are needed for sustainable development of the partner countries' health systems. It is recommended that more evidence-based proactive project planning and implementation be conducted to integrate patient safety culture into the health systems of developing countries, toward health policy on patient safety and quality service for the attainment of sustainable development goals in South Korea's development cooperation.

TI Stepping stones toward global space exploration
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB Several nations are currently engaging in or planning for robotic and human space exploration programs that target the Moon, Mars and near-Earth asteroids. These ambitious plans to build new space infrastructures, transport systems and space probes will require international cooperation if they are to be sustainable and affordable. Partnerships must involve not only established space powers, but also emerging space nations and developing countries: the participation of these new space actors will provide a bottom-up support structure that will aid program continuity, generate more active members in the space community, and increase public awareness of space activities in both developed and developing countries. The integration of many stakeholders into a global space exploration program represents a crucial element securing political and programmatic stability. How can the evolving space community learn to cooperate on a truly international level while engaging emerging space nations and developing countries in a meaningful way? We propose a stepping stone approach toward a global space exploration program, featuring three major elements: (1) an international Earth-based field research program preparing for planetary exploration, (2) enhanced exploitation of the International Space Station (ISS) enabling exploration and (3) a worldwide CubeSat program supporting exploration. An international Earth-based field research program can serve as a truly global exploration testbed that allows both established and new space actors to gain valuable experience by working together to prepare for future planetary exploration missions. Securing greater exploitation of the ISS is a logical step during its prolonged lifetime: ISS experiments, partnerships and legal frameworks are valuable foundations for exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Cooperation involving small, low-cost missions could be a major stride toward exciting and meaningful participation from emerging space nations and developing countries. For each of these three proposed stepping stones, recommendations for coordination mechanisms are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Role of Standards-Related Capacity Building on the Sustainable
   Development of Developing Countries: Focusing on the Korea's
   Standards-Related AfT Case in Bolivia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Many countries provide standards-related aid for trade (AfT) to developing countries in association with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as sharing their experiences and providing training or infrastructure. Regarding the influence of standards-related AfT on the sustainable development of developing countries, we studied Korea's standards-related AfT program to examine the role and features of standards-related AfT in terms of standards-related capacity building. In this study, we conducted a single case study with a focus on Korea's standards-related AfT in Bolivia using qualitative descriptive analysis. The result indicated that Korea's standards-related AfT is associated with three pillars of sustainable development in terms of standards-related capacity, namely standardization, conformity assessment, and metrology, and can be summarized with two key tasks: building testing infrastructure and improving Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) capacity. However, several limitations were found in Korea's standards-related capacity building activities, such as limited scope, limited target of the program, and the lack of activities for building institutional foundations for standards-related capacity.

   AND SERVICES: ROADMAPS, ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES & CHALLENGES
SE Public Administration and Information Technology
AB This chapter focuses on how ICT can be deployed to assist in the design and delivery of innovative public services in support of sustainable development. In many parts of the world, and especially in developing countries, basic public services like education, health, basic infrastructures, as well as water and sanitation, are often poor and patchy even when available. Such services are reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, and also address challenges like poverty, food, housing and employment. All of these need innovative public service delivery if targets are to be achieved by 2030. However, the provision of such services is increasingly challenged by the diversity of social needs across different locations and population segments. Mainstream, largely off-the-shelf, ICT has tremendous potential today and in the near future to innovatively address these needs and challenges, and there are already many valuable experiences both from developed and developing countries about how this can make huge differences to public service delivery. The chapter also addresses the governance and policy issues that need to be addressed in this context.

TI Designing for Scale: Development of the ReMotion Knee for Global
   Emerging Markets
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Amputees living in developing countries have a profound need for affordable and reliable lower limb prosthetic devices. The World Health Organization estimates there are approximately 30 million amputees living in low-income countries, with up to 95% lacking access to prosthetic devices. Effective prosthetics can significantly affect the lives of these amputees by increasing opportunity for employment and providing improvements to long-term health and well-being. However, current solutions are inadequate: state-of-the-art solutions from the US and Europe are cost-prohibitive, while low-cost devices have been challenged by poor quality and/or unreliable performance, and have yet to achieve large scale impact. The introduction of new devices is hampered by the lack of a cohesive prosthetics industry in low-income areas; the current network of low-cost prosthetic clinics is informal and loosely organized with significant disparities in geography, patient volume and demographics, device procurement, clinical and logistical infrastructure, and funding. At D-Rev (Design Revolution) we are creating the ReMotion Knee, which is an affordable polycentric prosthetic knee joint that performs on par with devices in more industrialized regions, like the US and Europe. As of September 2012, over 4200 amputees have been fitted with the initial version of the ReMotion Knee through a partnership with the JaipurFoot Organization, with an 79% compliance rate after 2 years. We are currently scaling production of the ReMotion Knee using centralized manufacturing and distribution to serve the existing clinics in low-income countries and increase the availability of devices for amputees without access to appropriate care. At D-Rev, we develop products that target these customers through economically-sustainable models and provide a measurable impact in the lives of the world's amputees.

TI Addressing the Climate Change-Sustainable Development Nexus: The Role of
   Multistakeholder Partnerships
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB While calls are being made to deal with the linkages between climate change and sustainable development to arrive at an integrated policy, concrete steps in this direction have been very limited so far. One of the possible instruments through which both issues may be approached simultaneously is a multistakeholder partnership, a form of governance with the potential to address existing regulatory, participation, resource and learning gaps as it harnesses the strengths of private, public, and nonprofit partners. There is some insight into partnerships for climate change, but largely limited to developed countries, and those in developing countries most often do not involve companies. To help fill this gap, this article explores the role of multistakeholder partnerships in addressing climate change and sustainable development in developing-country settings. It elaborates on the governance function of partnerships, on actor involvement, the gaps addressed, as well as synergies and trade-offs in the climate change-sustainable development nexus and how partnerships may help address them. As the number of such partnerships is still limited, we discuss seven illustrative partnerships and draw conclusions as to further conceptualizations and implications for research and practice.

TI The WTO Law and the EC's GSP plus Arrangement
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The European Communities (EC) has developed a Generalized System of Preferences (GSO, inchedin g the 'Special Incentives for Sustainable Development and Good Governance', also known as GSP+. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) law, GSPs are generally authorized by the Enabling Clause, allowing developed countries to grant trade preferences to the advantage of developing countries on a non-reciprocal basis. However, trade negotiations and disputes pertaining to these preferences have been some of the most difficult and acrimonious. This article argues that the GSP+ violates the most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle of Article 1:1 GATT and therefore is only compliant with WTO law if it can be justified on appropriate legal grounds.

AB Due to high labor costs, e-waste recycling companies in industrialized countries increasingly adopt destructive mechanical pre-processing based treatments. These processes perform poorly for precious metals and plastics due to material incompatibility and increased entropy, resulting in low effective recycling efficiencies for these material categories. In developing countries most e-waste treatments consist of manual dismantling, followed by primitive refining techniques, which is not only inefficient, but also poses a serious threat to the environment. This article assesses, from an economic and environmental perspective, a cooperation scenario between Belgium and Kenya in which manual dismantling and state of the art metal refining techniques for recycling computers are combined. Findings show that international cooperation could offer a more sustainable solution, yet measures must be taken to avoid the "cherry picking" of valuable components and environmentally unsound disposal of the remaining parts.

TI The Current Status of International Partnerships for Child Surgery in

SO INTERNATIONAL SURGERY
AB Disparity still exists in the surgical care between sub-Saharan Africa and developed countries. Several international initiatives have been undertaken in the past decades to address the disparity. This study looks at the impact of these programs in child surgery in Sub-Saharan Africa. Review of electronic databases Medline and African Index Medicus on international partnerships for child surgery in Sub-Saharan Africa was undertaken. Four types of international initiatives were identified and consist of periodic medical missions; partnerships between foreign medical institutions or charities and local institutions; international health electives by surgical residents; and training of individual surgeons from developing countries in foreign institutions. The results of these efforts were variable, but sustainability and self-reliance of host nations were limited. Sociocultural factors, dearth of facilities, and lack of local governments' commitment were main impediments to effective local development or transfer of modern protocols of surgical management and improvement of pediatric surgical care at the host community level. Current initiatives may need improvements with better understanding of the sociocultural dynamics and local politics of the host nation, and improved host nation involvement and commitment. This may engender development of locally controlled viable services and sustainable high level of care.

First, experiences in both developing countries and Europe with participatory rural appraisal, a method of open citizen participation, are reviewed. Four critical fields of success are identified to structure the empirical analysis. The second part addresses some of the theoretical concerns from the perspective of a contractual approach that understands participation as cooperation. In this critical analysis, legitimacy dilemmas of participatory approaches are central.

Therefore in order to promote sustainable space development and to solve space conflicts within the region, all Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) nations should embark on greater regional space cooperation as soon as possible. Because regional space cooperation can assure equal rights to space benefits, it does not limit returns only to the first beneficiary or the first user to receive space benefits. In the end, the total space benefits will be spread to other cooperating countries equally. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Applying Knowledge Management in Public Health Intervention: A Street
   Food Safety Perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND SYSTEMS SCIENCE
AB Street food safety (SFS) has become an emerging public health concern in most developing countries like Bangladesh. Interventions are trying to improve the sector; however, a lack of coordination and value co-creation between macro and micro-level stakeholders strongly impedes the achievement of long-term benefits. Therefore, community participation is needed to achieve a multi-stakeholder partnership (MSP) and community-based knowledge management (KM) for a successful intervention. The purpose of this study is to identify secondary school students as KM tools to facilitate knowledge management activities. The action research was conducted using community people in two major cities in Bangladesh. Based on the findings, students can act as KM tools who can facilitate coordination and value co-creation process. A conceptual framework has been proposed to understand the MSP and KM concepts where the integrated strategy of those two concepts not only develops a sustainable solution for the SFS system but also can be applied to many other public health issues in developing countries.

TI Missing the point: Quality-driven healthcare institutions may mistakenly
   disregard their role in nursing and medical education
SO NURSING FORUM
AB Aligned with international standards, the UAE Government and many other developing countries in the region (GCC and MENA) have started to implement strict quality improvement initiatives to develop their healthcare systems. Most of these initiatives are geared toward meeting patient satisfaction and avoiding circumstances or events that would dissatisfy patients. It is also used to measure healthcare institution performance, assess efficiency and determine their funding and reimbursement. With this emphasis on quality, it is also important for healthcare organizations to fulfill their other functions. Among the most important is performing their teaching role to prepare future healthcare professionals, and attracting and retaining healthcare professionals. These roles are also a paramount for a quality, sustained healthcare system. However, clinical educators and managers reflect on how these roles seem to be frequently missed or at least compromised while applying the quality assurance measures in the region developing countries. This reflective paper discusses this concern and suggests possible strategies that may help overcome this challenge and thus contributing to the achievement of the quality goal of the service in a more comprehensive and sustainable manner. The similarities between the UAE healthcare system and neighboring Gulf Cooperation Council and the Middle East/North African countries mean these challenges and solutions may resonate with these countries and support the implementation of effective health services in these countries as well.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The deforestation in Indonesia is already alarming. One of the strategies used by the government to overcome forest deforestation is social forestry. This program is called PHBM (Pengelolaan Hutan Bersama Masyarakat/Joint Forest Management) which is basically a partnership program. This study aims at describing the partnership program between a local organization (i.e. LMDH) and a government unit (i.e. RPH of Perhutani) within the PHBM program. The objectives of this study are to (a) describe the model of partnerships between LMDH and RPH Besowo for sustainable forest management and local community empowerment; (b) determine the contribution of the forest to the national economy and rural household income; and (c) determine the obstacles commonly found in Besowo forest that have to be faced during the implementation of the partnerships. The study shows that with good partnership between these two units, the prosperity of the local community can be enhanced and the forest preservation can be maintained. The model of the partnerships in this particular area in Indonesia is expected to be applicable as well in other rural areas in Indonesia, as well as in other developing countries.

TI Developing a multidimensional assessment framework for clean technology
   transfer potential and its application on the Belt and Road Initiative
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The transfer of industrial clean technology can contribute to the transformation of industry sustainable development to address the dual challenges of climate change and environmental pollution. Although its importance is widely acknowledged, there is still a lack of scientific and quantitative assessment framework to precisely and effectively identify high-potential cooperation targets in the context of countries with diverse backgrounds. To fill this gap, this study proposed a multidimensional assessment framework for industrial clean technology transfer potential with application in 58 BRI developing countries. This study reviewed existing literature on the main barriers and drivers of clean technology transfer and extracted four assessment dimensions as primary indicators, namely the recipient country's macro environment, industry development, clean technology demand, and clean technology transfer guarantee, with 13 secondary indicators, 52 tertiary indicators based on the opensource database and common assessment index. The established framework was then used to assess the potential for China's industrial clean technology transfer to 58 developing countries under the Belt and Road Initiative, with the weights of indicators at all levels determined by the analytic hierarchy process method based on expert questionnaires and equal weighting method. The findings demonstrate that there are significant differences in clean technology transfer potential among studied countries. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia are the best options for China, while Bolivia, Cameroon, and Algeria have the lowest technology transfer potential. Our work can not only assist technology providers with overall country selection in industrial cleaner technology transfer cooperation and strengthen their risk prevention capacity, but also help countries with low cooperation potential or obvious weaknesses to identify deficiencies and make targeted improvements, as well as serve as a reference for other international technology cooperation assessments.

TI Implementation of a phased medical educational approach in a developing
   country
SO GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB Objective: Healthcare provider education can serve as one method for improving healthcare in developing countries. Working with providers at St Luke Hospital in Haiti, we developed a phased educational approach through partnership development, face-to-face teaching, and virtual educational tools.
   Design: Our novel approach included three phases: direct patient care, targeted education, and utilization of the train-the-trainer model. Our end goal was an educational system that could be utilized by the local medical staff to continually improve their medical knowledge, even after our educational project was completed. We implemented pre- and post-lecture evaluations during our teaching phase to determine whether the education provided was effective and beneficial. Additionally, we provided medical lectures on a shared file internet platform, Box.com, during the train-the-trainer phase to allow healthcare providers in Haiti to access the educational content electronically.
   Results: In total, 47 lectures were given to 150 medical providers, including nurses, physicians, and pharmacists. Pre- and post-lecture evaluations were administered. The mean was 30.63 (14.40) for pre-lecture evaluations and 93.36 (9.80) for post-lecture evaluations indicating improvement out of a total of 100 possible points. Our collaborative Box.com account contains 214 medical education lectures available for viewing as a constant resource to St Luke Hospital staff. Thus far, 20 of the 43 (47%) Haitian medical providers have viewed lectures, with an average of 5.6 lectures viewed per person. Qualitative data suggest that these methods improved communication between healthcare staff, promoted better ways of triaging patients, and improved job satisfaction.
   Conclusions: A phased educational approach can improve healthcare workers' knowledge through partnership in a developing country. Educating local providers is one way of ensuring that in-country healthcare staff will improve their medical knowledge and expertise.

AB The "Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin" is coordinating two collaborative EU-projects aimed at incorporating Value Chain approaches into horticultural and agricultural curricula at universities in developing countries. The ValueLEad project aims at enabling student education in sustainable and quality-oriented fresh-food chain management (FFCM) at two African universities, with a focus on poverty alleviation and meeting the needs of the agri-food sector, in particular the vegetables and fruit as well as dairy sectors. The DOCUMAP project focuses on education and training in the fields of supply chain management and postharvest handling of vegetables and fruit at three Asian universities. The projects are based on three assumptions:
   Graduates of horticultural (and agricultural) study programmes require analytical and problem-solving skills, an interdisciplinary thinking style, team work and communication skills and - centrally - aptitude and attitude of self-directed learning in order to master the challenges of their future jobs in rapidly changing horticultural and food sectors.
   Problem-Based Learning (PBL)-type student research projects and multiple collaboration with actors of the agri-food sector are central elements of study programmes with these competence-based learning objectives.
   Curricula, institutions and human resources need to be simultaneously developed on different levels in order to adapt study programmes to this end.
   The projects thus address lecturers at the African and Asian partner universities within various complementary project activities for development of student-centred PBL and interdisciplinary research as well as other Value-Chain related curriculum elements. Furthermore, the cooperation between the universities offers a basis for North-South and South-South academic partnership networks for continuous development of the food-chain management concept and its adaptation to African and Asian reality.
   In this article the concepts of and experiences with the two projects are described, successes and challenges analysed and conclusions for refinement of the approach presented.

TI Partner Selection Strategies in Global Business Ecosystems: Country

   Quality Perception
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Consumers perceive brand quality from the country of origin of the brand. Global business ecosystems represent multiple countries such as the country of the keystone company and the country of the assembly companies. Thus, the brands of global business ecosystems have multiple countries of origin. This study aims to examine the impacts of the country images of the keystone company and assembly companies on consumers' brand quality perceptions. In addition, depending on the assembly partner selection strategies of forming a global business ecosystem, the characteristics of the associated countries with the business ecosystem may change. The keystone company may select an assembly partner from a developing country or from a developed country. These two cases are compared to examine the impacts of the combined country images of the keystone and assembly companies. To do so, this study surveys Vietnamese consumers' perceptions of the brand Hyundai Motor, the country images of South Korea as the country of the keystone company, India as the assembly partner from the developing country, and USA as the assembly partner from the developed country. The collected data were analyzed using a structural equations modeling method and results are discussed with theoretical and managerial implications.

TI Understanding the Role of Rural Entrepreneurs in Telecentre
   Sustainability: A Comparative Study of the Akshaya and eSeva Projects in
   India
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB In rural areas of India, telecentres provide access to computers and other digital technologies and have been utilized as a delivery channel for various government services. Following a public-private partnership (PPP) model, there is a general belief among policy makers that the revenue from government-to-consumer (G2C) services would be sufficient to cover the village-level entrepreneurs' cash flow requirements and therefore provide financial sustainability. Also, the literature suggests that telecentres have a large enough market for public-access businesses to be commercially viable. In India, around 100,000 telecentres are being set up to serve 600,000 villages - one telecentre for every six villages - to provide one-window access to government services. In the literature, a lack of government services is often quoted as a reason for telecentre failure. This study, using an exploratory approach, aims to understand the parameters that relate to the sustainability of telecentres across a number of common, government-related services. It is observed that some telecentres perform better than the others even though they have the same number of government-related services. Reasons for such differences are explored and the learnings from this research will benefit the stakeholders who are engaged in providing telecentre-based services in other developing countries. In addition, a theoretical framework is suggested to understand the dynamics between different types of sustainability parameters such as financial, social, staff, technology, and institutional. The findings of this research have policy implications in terms of the way services are designed and delivered through telecentres in developing countries such as India.

TI Emerging trends in informal sector recycling in developing and
   transition countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Optimistic estimates suggest that only 30-70% of waste generated in cities of developing countries is collected for disposal. As a result, uncollected waste is often disposed of into open dumps, along the streets or into water bodies. Quite often, this practice induces environmental degradation and public health risks. Notwithstanding, such practices also make waste materials readily available for itinerant waste pickers. These 'scavengers' as they are called, therefore perceive waste as a resource, for income generation. Literature suggests that Informal Sector Recycling (ISR) activity can bring other benefits such as, economic growth, litter control and resources conservation. This paper critically reviews trends in ISR activities in selected developing and transition countries. ISR often survives in very hostile social and physical environments largely because of negative Government and public attitude. Rather than being stigmatised, the sector should be recognised as an important element for achievement of sustainable waste management in developing countries. One solution to this problem could be the integration of ISR into the formal waste management system. To achieve ISR integration, this paper highlights six crucial aspects from literature: social acceptance, political will, mobilisation of cooperatives, partnerships with private enterprises, management and technical skills, as well as legal protection measures. It is important to note that not every country will have the wherewithal to achieve social inclusion and so the level of integration must be 'flexible'. In addition, the structure of the ISR should not be based on a 'universal' model but should instead take into account local contexts and conditions.

TI Digitalization mechanisms of health management information systems in
   developing countries
SO INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION
AB The developmental potential of IT in developing countries continues to be confronted by enduring problems that hamper both the sustainability of digitalization initiatives and the realization of their expected benefits. Using a critical realist perspective, this paper examines the underlying causal chain of health management information system (HMIS) digitalization in a developing country. The study develops a mechanism-based explanation of the digitalization process drawing on Archer's morphogenetic approach (1995). Four generative mechanisms of HMIS digitalization were identified: projectification, informatization, embedded inscription and scaling. Theoretically, the paper demonstrates the joint value of Archer's structurational theory and the dynamics of interrelated causal mechanisms of digitalization. We offer three insights for ICT4D practice: First, projects as primary modalities for digitalization have created partnership asymmetries between NGO and local institutions hindering sustainable development. Second, lack of formalized arrangements around multi-stakeholder collaboration has led to poor accountability and regulatory environments. Finally, total dependency on external partners as NGO assumes a gap-filling role thereby replacing rather than building local institutional capacity.

TI Critical success factors for digital partnering of construction
   organisations - A Delphi study
SO ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The construction organisations in developing countries are lagging in digital technology usage; hence, they are still characterised by poor project delivery and technological backwardness. To checkmate this problem, partnering with other organisations was proposed, while critical factors needed for successful digital partnering of construction organisations were assessed. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative research approach. Delphi method was used to get experts' opinion on some identified factors necessary for successful digital partnering. The experts for the study were selected using defined criteria, and a combination of interquartile deviation, Kendall's coefficient of concordance and chi-square was used to achieve robust consensus among respondents. Mann-Whitney U test was also used to ascertain the difference in perception of experts. Findings The findings revealed trust in digital partners, top management support and digital partner selection as the three key success factors for partnering. Other factors that can be considered alongside these main factors are the creation of a common goal, a long-term commitment, effective communication, proper conflict resolution and structured as well as continuous digital training, workshops and meetings. Practical implications Instead of going through the digitalisation journey alone, construction organisations, particularly in a developing country like South Africa, stand a better chance of surviving the dynamic construction and digital environment by partnering with other organisations within and outside the industry. Carefully selecting the right partner, trusting in their capability and ensuring constant commitment is necessary for the success of the process. Originality/value The value of this study lies in its ability to showcase the critical success factors needed for effective digital partnering, an aspect that lacks adequate consideration in the digitalisation of construction industry discourse.

TI The Role of Education in the Prevention of Radicalization and Violent
   Extremism in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Only since the beginning of this century, the prevention of radicalization has become an important topic in debates about terrorism and sustainable development in developing countries. Research has shown that radicalized individuals are not uneducated, but have often completed secondary or tertiary education. Additionally, it became clear that some extremist groups consider the school environment as an attractive recruitment place. These findings led to a new approach where the education sector is considered as a prominent partner in preventing and combating the radicalization of young individuals. In this article, the potential limitations of the role of the education sector in developing countries are exposed. Based on previous research, three bottlenecks in the education sector were found: unequal access to education, poor quality of education and the relationship between education and employment. In order to strengthen the role of education for sustainable development in developing countries, it is recommended that equal access to education is improved, that schools invest in the creation of safe spaces for their students, that not only secondary but also primary and tertiary education are involved in policy strategies regarding radicalization, and that the job market is adjusted to the educational level of graduated students.

TI Advancing a Performance Management Tool for Service Delivery in Local
   Government
SO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Various strategic plans compiled by the local levels of government seek to advance the need to integrate strategic planning frameworks and improve service delivery and related content through the application of performance management tools. From the perspective of municipalities, all policies and plans at all levels of government need to be articulated with empirical based plan-level formulation and in compliance with set performance assessment criteria. Using South Africa as a case study, the methodology of the paper included a theoretical analysis of available (but applicable) performance management tools and processes. The focus and outcome were the development of a simplified performance management tool that supports elementary prioritization of projects and the setting of standards to address the growing needs, service backlogs, and informality challenges, thereby enhancing sustainable planning and development applicable to developing countries. The study findings highlight, firstly, the prevalence of persistent service delivery gaps in local government. Secondly, local government performance management and strategic plan implementation is constrained by measurement data, standards, and information gaps. Thirdly, inadequate legislative frameworks and strategic instruments applicable to local government in developing countries adds another layer of performance management gap dimensions. Fourthly, there is misalignment between policies, legislative provisions, and local needs in terms of a set of applicable measurement tools and standards relevant in a developing country. Fifthly, an oversight role gap exists in terms of clearly defining the roles and scope of responsibilities concerning performance management. These above-mentioned shortcomings read together constitute a service delivery performance management tools gap that needs to be overcome if improved service delivery is to be achieved. In view of the above-stated considerations, a simplified performance management tool to enhance service delivery in local government had to be developed. The developed simplified performance management tool assumes that the application of performance management assessment processes is to be aligned throughout all spheres of government.

TI Evaluation of the Long-Term Stability and Impact of Remittances and
   Development Aid on Sustainable Economic Growth in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In our paper, we analyse the long-term stability and impact of remittances and development aid on sustainable economic growth in developing countries. We use two data samples from countries that were recipients of both aid and remittances in the corresponding period. First, unbalanced data from the years 1970 to 2017; that is, how countries appear in the data. Second, balanced data, where we selected the largest possible set of countries for which data exists without gaps from the years 1970-2017. This dataset consists of 57 countries for the period from 1991 to 2017. Using linear regression models, we conclude that up until the end of the 1980s, the size of aid as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) was larger than the share of remittances. After that, the situation changed and the shares of both inflows were broadly similar. The inflow of remittances was more stable than the inflow of aid and development aid did not (on the contrary to remittances) contribute positively to sustainable economic growth if we consider the entire period between 1970 and 2017. Our results suggest that a statistically significant relationship between development aid and economic growth (per capita) may be observed only in the period from 1990 to 1999. Economic growth in developing countries is negatively influenced by the uncertainty related to the flows of official development assistance (ODA) and aid in all investigated decades. In the case of the remittance flows, the increased volatility tends to contribute negatively to sustainable economic growth only when the remittance flows represent a relatively higher share of GDP.

SO CONTEMPORARY NURSE
AB Despite the high demand for skilled care of mental health consumers, many countries experience difficulty attracting and maintaining a sufficiently educated and trained mental health workforce, including nurses. In developing countries such as Fiji, nurses are the primary providers of mental healthcare, yet often do so with minimal specialist education and training. In this paper, we discuss the development and implementation of the first mental health nursing postgraduate program in Fiji. We also raise critical issues in building successful educational partnerships between developed and developing countries, including those of capacity-building, managing organizational change, and achieving sustainability. In doing so, our aim is that our experiences may be helpful to others seeking to work together in similar ways.

TI Financial sustainability in municipal solid waste management - Costs and
   revenues in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Providing good solid waste management (SWM) services while also ensuring financial sustainability of the system continues to be a major challenge in cities of developing countries. Bahir Dar in northwestern Ethiopia outsourced municipal waste services to a private waste company in 2008. While this institutional change has led to substantial improvement in the cleanliness of the city, its financial sustainability remains unclear. Is the private company able to generate sufficient revenues from their activities to offset the costs and generate some profit?
   This paper presents a cost-revenue analysis, based on data from July 2009 to June 2011. The analysis reveals that overall costs in Bahir Dar's SWM system increased significantly during this period, mainly due to rising costs related to waste transportation. On the other hand, there is only one major revenue stream in place: the waste collection fee from households, commercial enterprises and institutions. As the efficiency of fee collection from households is only around 50%, the total amount of revenues are not sufficient to cover the running costs. This results in a substantial yearly deficit. The results of the research therefore show that a more detailed cost structure and cost-revenue analysis of this waste management service is important with appropriate measures, either by the privates sector itself or with the support of the local authorities, in order to enhance cost efficiency and balance the cost-revenues towards cost recovery. Delays in mitigating the evident financial deficit could else endanger the public-private partnership (PPP) and lead to failure of this setup in the medium to long term, thus also endangering the now existing improved and currently reliable service.
   We present four options on how financial sustainability of the SWM system in Bahir Dar might be enhanced: (i) improved fee collection efficiency by linking the fees of solid waste collection to water supply; (ii) increasing the value chain by sales of organic waste recycling products; (iii) diversifying revenue streams and financing mechanisms (polluter-pays-, cross-subsidy- and business-principles); and (iv) cost reduction and improved cost-effectiveness.
   We argue that in a PPP setup such as in Bahir Dar, a strong alliance between the municipality and private enterprise is important so that appropriate solutions for improved financial sustainability of a SWM system can be sought and implemented.

TI POSITIONING CHINA'S AID TO EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA: PAST,
   PRESENT, AND POST-2015
SO POST-EDUCATION-FOR-ALL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM: STRUCTURAL
   CHANGES WITH DIVERSIFYING ACTORS AND NORMS
SE International Perspectives on Education and Society
AB This chapter aims to investigate and interpret China's educational aid by analyzing its history, philosophies, and practices in Africa. The study is based on review and analysis of governmental documents, reports, academic papers, and news by Chinese and foreign scholars on China's aid, particularly educational aid to Africa. The analysis unveils three transformations of Chind.c aid "from pro-ideology to de-ideology," "from single area to multiple areas," and 'from pragmatic economy driven to sustainable and humane economy focused" in Africa. Meanwhile, it indicates a continuity of the philosophy of solidarity, morality, and reciprocity in China's South-South cooperation with African educational development.
   The analysis also shows China's educational aid does not match well with the framework of the Western donors. China, under the FOCAC framework, is devoted to higher education cooperation, human resources training program, scholarship, and Chinese language education with African partners. With the growth of its economic and political influence, China will play multiple roles as the biggest developing country and as an active promoter and provider for South-South cooperation in the negotiation and construction of the post-2015 agenda. Nevertheless, we assume China will keep a pragmatic higher education cooperation with its developing country partners to inclusively link it with business, technology transfer, and people-to-people exchange.
   This study delivers a comprehensive review and analysis of paradigm shift, philosophy, mechanism, and practice of China's educational aid to Africa to fill up the literature gap in this field. It also timely presents China's stance toward discussion on the post-2015 agenda.

TI Innovation systems in Malaysia: a perspective of university-industry R&D
   collaboration
SO AI & SOCIETY
AB Collaborative research and development (R&D) activities between public universities and industry are of importance for the sustainable development of the innovation ecosystem. However, policymakers especially in developing countries show little knowledge on the issues. In this paper, we analyse the level of university-industry collaboration in Malaysia. We further examine the fundamental conditions that hinder university-industry collaboration despite the government's initiatives to improve such linkages. We show that the low collaboration is a result of an R&D gap between the entities. While the universities engage in basic and fundamental R&D, the private sectors involved in incremental innovation that requires less R&D investments. The different nature of the industries' R&D requires closer cooperation between firms namely buyers, suppliers and technical service providers and not the universities. Among others, the lack of an intermediary role, absorptive capacity and collaborative initiative by the industry also contribute to the problem. The study suggests that the collaborative activities can benefit both if deliberate and effective efforts on reducing the R&D mismatch are made between the universities and industry. Likewise, proper institutional arrangements in coordinating these activities are required. This result seems to reflect the nature of many developing countries' national innovation systems, and therefore, lessons from Malaysia may serve as a good case study.

TI Identifying the underpin of green and low carbon technology innovation
   research: A literature review from 1994 to 2010
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This article examined the literatures enlisted in the database of SCI and SSCI on the topics with regard to green technology and low carbon technology innovation from 1994 to 2010. It intends the service with the purpose of helping researchers and practitioners understand what issues or subjects have been addressed in green and low carbon technology innovation and initiate a journey for the next generation of sustainable-oriented research.
   Some critical discussion and conclusion are as follows: (1) it shows a positive journey of green and low carbon technology innovation. The research of Western Europe and North America is highly advanced compared to other developing countries, especially in terms of new resource and renewable energy technology innovation. (2) The empirical research, such as sample survey and field study with primary data, is prevalent and preponderating over other methods (conceptual, qualitative and formal models research). (3) The research subjects are multi-perspective and multi-disciplinary, covering environment science, management, energy and fuels, economics and social behavior. So far the research fields mainly focus on technology adoption, diffusion, transfer, policy making or implementation, and advanced technology development. New vibrancy of advanced theoretical and methodological research is particularly needed, especially for low carbon technology innovation trajectory, performance evaluation, government policy instrument and multi-level cooperation among enterprises, governments and NGOs. (4) The local governments and NGO's have played a key role on the promotion of low carbon techniques particularly in developing countries such as China. (5) Green and low carbon technology innovation cannot be isolated from the policy or regulation regime, and is becoming a new underpin of current sustainable development coupled with social energy system contributing to control the climate change.

TI Analysis of the partnership network in the clean development mechanism
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The clean development mechanism (CDM) is a global collaborative action proposed at the Kyoto Protocol in response to climate change issues. The CDM contributes to cost-efficient reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries and promotes sustainable development in developing countries. Its fundamental framework is based on partnerships between industrialized and developing countries. This study employs social network analysis to investigate the dynamics of the partnership networks observed in 3816 CDM projects registered in the database of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change over the period of 2005 to 2011. Our three main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the CDM partnership network is a small world; however, its density tends to decrease as the number of participants for a CDM project decreases. Second, the partnership networks' leading groups tend to shift from partner countries into host countries. Third, a host country that pursues more partnership-based projects takes better control of resources and knowledge-flow in the ego-network formed around that country, and can thus better utilize global resources for its CDM projects.

AB Renewable energy technology (RET) project is a capital investment; hence, enough fund must be made available to prevent either delay or abandoning of the project. It is, therefore, compulsory that stakeholders consider all alternatives for RET funding before the commencement of a RET project. This article presents a framework that improves how RET financing models are analyzed under uncertainty conditions. The framework integrates best worst (BW) method and extended Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method; these methods were selected because they improve the optimality of a decision-making process. Selected social, technical, economic, environmental and policy (STEEP) indicators were used to evaluate RET financing models. BW method was used to evaluate these indicators importance. The implementation of solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid project in a remote community in Nigeria was used as a case study. Based on literature knowledge, three RET financing models (debt -P1, private equity -P2, and public funds -P3) were selected based on their unique attributes to public projects success in developing countries. From a STEEP perspective, these models were ranked as follows: P1>P2>P3.

AB Since 1993, the prospects of intraregional trade in West Africa have been the subject of much debate. On the one hand, Foroutan and Pritchett (1993) explain the low level of trade between sub-Saharan African countries by structural factors; on the other hand, Naudet (1993) shows that trade growth potential is important between West African countries. This debate is even more important because the seven countries that form the UEMOA have reasserted their willingness to strengthen their economic relationship in January 1994. This article tries through highlights of the different determinants of intraregional trade to show that effective regional cooperation is an important factor to promote trade between developing countries, and to determine why and how the UEMOA could be the cornerstone of sustainable development in West Africa.

TI Long-term solutions for the problem of vaccine shortages
SO EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
AB During the past few years, vaccine shortage has been a serious problem affecting both developed and developing countries. The explanation is linked to the poor economic value associated with vaccines. Although every year the routine use of vaccines saves millions of lives, the economic value associated with them is negligible, especially if compared with the pharmaceutical market. This situation disincentives private investment which prefers to focus on more profitable business. To overcome these problems, it is essential to recognise that the intangible value of vaccination (the value of being alive and healthy) represents the real value provided by vaccines. if the intangible value were to be included in the vaccine price, vaccines would become as attractive as other pharmaceuticals. While waiting for a long-term sustainable solution, public-private partnerships represent a way to increase vaccine value awareness and to decrease the risk for vaccine manufacturers. This article will provide examples of how public-private partnerships both in developed and developing countries have been established to handle specific problems concerning vaccination.

TI Economic valuation of environmental and health impacts from mining: the
   case of Peru
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The main objective of this paper is to elicit and assess rural communities' nonmarket values of the effects of mining on their (1) health and (2) environment directly affecting their economic activities. This paper is one of very few to elicit preferences about mining in rural communities in a developing country, close to mines and exposed to mining externalities. Using stated preference methods, we find that to prevent the externalities from mining, the poorest individuals in our sample are willing to contribute average amounts equal to at least their average households' weekly consumption expenditures. Our results are useful for stakeholders. First, this sector plays an essential role in the economy of many developing countries like Peru with little diversified economies. It is critical for these governments to ensure that mining activities are sustainable to avoid conflicts of many types and at various scales. Countries like Peru cannot risk missing out on the development benefits that well-governed mining can bring to them. Second, it is also urgent for mining companies to take care not only of their carbon and water footprint, but also their impacts on the environment and livelihoods in the regions where they operate, and their contribution to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These issues need to be of high priority for countries that are highly dependent on mining as their trading partners implement environmental regulations.

Advanced technology adoption by smallholders can become a choice, dependent on the containment of ecological risks, rather than a survivalist strategy. We examine research led by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and make clear that public-sector research and the international organizations can significantly contribute to the adoption of evidence-based policies that support context-specific combinations of low- and high-tech approaches.

TI Are the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Developing Countries
   Ready to Implement Circular Economy Practices? An Empirical Quest for
   Key Readiness Factors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB While most of the circular economy (CE) research is engrossed in larger organizations and developed countries, there is hardly any research exploring the readiness of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries toward the implementation of CE practices. To fill this knowledge gap, in this article, we aim to identify and evaluate the key readiness factors (RFs) that are vital for CE implementation. Initially, 15 important RFs are identified via an extensive literature review and experts' consultation, which are prioritized using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method. The proposed framework is validated with a real-world case study involving four India-based SMEs. The results reveal that "willingness of top management to implement CE practices" is the most important RF. Six RFs are classified as causal: "availing financial assistance from government and external agencies," "introducing new technology and its compatibility with existing technology," "willingness of top management to implement CE practices," "investment in infrastructural development," "pressures from competitors, business partners, and regulatory bodies to implement CE practices," and "awareness among the customers about CE benefits." The findings of this research may help managers assess CE readiness and prepare business strategies for effective implementation of CE practices.

At the same time, the SDGs have recognized the essential role of the main social actors such as businesses, government, civil society, and universities working together to reach a sustainable development. However, the literature related to Industry-University collaboration remains underdeveloped. Moreover, Industry-University CSP in developing countries exhibits unique complexities. This paper proposes a quantitative methodology to identify the key dynamic determinants of the implementation of CSP between industry and university in the context of a developing country. The methodology involves non-parametric association and inferential statistical analysis to obtain the main determinants that lead to the implementation of these programs. A case study in a developing country was created and surveys of companies were collected and analyzed. The proposed methodology is transferable to different types of partnerships and other geographical contexts.

TI The demographic impact and development benefits of meeting demand for
   family planning with modern contraceptive methods
SO GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB Background: Meeting demand for family planning can facilitate progress towards all major themes of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. Many policymakers have embraced a benchmark goal that at least 75% of the demand for family planning in all countries be satisfied with modern contraceptive methods by the year 2030.Objective: This study examines the demographic impact (and development implications) of achieving the 75% benchmark in 13 developing countries that are expected to be the furthest from achieving that benchmark.Methods: Estimation of the demographic impact of achieving the 75% benchmark requires three steps in each country: 1) translate contraceptive prevalence assumptions (with and without intervention) into future fertility levels based on biometric models, 2) incorporate each pair of fertility assumptions into separate population projections, and 3) compare the demographic differences between the two population projections. Data are drawn from the United Nations, the US Census Bureau, and Demographic and Health Surveys.Results: The demographic impact of meeting the 75% benchmark is examined via projected differences in fertility rates (average expected births per woman's reproductive lifetime), total population, growth rates, age structure, and youth dependency. On average, meeting the benchmark would imply a 16 percentage point increase in modern contraceptive prevalence by 2030 and a 20% decline in youth dependency, which portends a potential demographic dividend to spur economic growth.Conclusions: Improvements in meeting the demand for family planning with modern contraceptive methods can bring substantial benefits to developing countries. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show formally how such improvements can alter population size and age structure. Declines in youth dependency portend a demographic dividend, an added bonus to the already well-known benefits of meeting existing demands for family planning.

AB There is limited information available on the status of and threats to mangroves in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the recent years, there has been a significant increase in scientific and volunteer surveys. However, this information is usually not well integrated with information on human activities that have the potential to contribute to the degradation of these ecosystems. A project "Coastal Habitats at Risk" is being developed jointly by the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Resources Institute, and in partnership with UNESCO and the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME), in an effort to ameliorate this situation through standardized assessment of anthropogenic threats to mangroves in East and Southeast Asia. The geographic focus of the project includes Brunei, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Threats from pollution, over-harvesting, aquaculture development, boating/shipping, flooding/freshwater input, siltation and other coastal development are examined with this map-based analysis. The study particularly emphasizes information regarding the human element of these ecosystems, with an eye towards community-based management and action. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool will be developed to examine different coastal development and management scenarios and their implications for mangrove health, diversity and value. The results will serve as an indication of the threats to these ecosystems, not as an actual measure of degradation. This information generation can be seen as a first step toward assessing global needs for the world's mangrove ecosystems that to date remain largely unassessed. The analysis is intended to recommend policies, participatory approaches and management strategies to promote integrated coastal ecosystem approaches. It will help fill an information void through much-needed policy guidance on management and priority setting.

TI The Challenges of Assessing the Effectiveness of Biodiversity-Related
   Development Aid
SO TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB Official Development Assistance is a major funding source for biodiversity conservation in developing countries, and it is therefore important to understand the effectiveness of biodiversity aid. However, three challenges hamper the analysis of how effectively biodiversity-related development aid (biodiversity aid) contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use. First, few indicators measure biodiversity aspects at country level in a consistent and comparable way. Second, biodiversity aid reporting methods do not reveal the exact funding amount for projects' biodiversity component. Third, changes in biodiversity status are empirically and conceptually difficult to attribute to aid activities. Based on a theoretical elaboration of these challenges, we argue that for a better assessment of how biodiversity aid contributes to conserving biodiversity and to reducing biodiversity loss, three improvements are required: a more frequent and more consistent assessment of the biodiversity status across countries, more exact quantification of biodiversity aid, and a more detailed understanding about biodiversity loss and the role biodiversity aid plays. These improvements will allow for more reliable aid-effectiveness analyses, which will, in turn, enable better informed aid-allocation decisions to be made.

TI Restricting Biofuel Imports in the Name of the Environment: How Does the
   Application of WTO Rules Affect Developing Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB There are calls for biofuel imports from developing countries to be restricted. The imports which are either in the form of end-product (bioethanol or biodiesel) or feedstock (oil palm, sugar cane molasses, etc) are allegedly produced in ways which can threaten the environment and violate human rights. This article finds that there is no specific regime for trade in biofuels within the WTO system. Hence any restriction on such trade is governed by the existing trade regimes including tariffs and non-tariff measures. However, the existing WTO tariff and non-tariff (TBT, anti-dumping and anti-subsidy) regimes are still inadequate in ensuring that measures are taken against biofuel feedstock and products that were produced in unsustainable ways. The use of these measures without being subject to clear defining rules will create a danger that they serve a protectionist rather than social or environmental objectives.

AB The three major international texts adopted in 2015 - Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Climate Agreement- place national public policies and actors at the heart of international development cooperation (IDC). By bringing IDC closer to national institutions, particularly development banks, and taking it further away from traditional foreign policy, this shift has challenged long-held IDC narratives and structures, both among developed and developing countries. It has also laid the foundations for a degree of structured and universal accountability within the international development cooperation system, setting the stage for a wider shift within global governance.

AB The process of industrialization in Sao Paulo started in the late 19th Century, reached a climax in the 1970s and declined in the early 1980s, shifting the economic profile from industrial to service providers. Many plants were shut down, leading to a change in land use and the emergence of contaminated sites, many of them abandoned.
   In 2000 there was an estimated 2,500 potentially abandoned contaminated sites, whereas in 2003 the picture was about 4,000 sites out of around 16,000 potentially contaminated ones, which posed a threat to the environment and also raised social concerns since low income people, who cannot afford to rent a house, settle themselves on abandoned areas.
   In order to tackle these issues, both Local and State Governments have started to develop public policies targeting the management of brownfields, but the City Government only issued the first act in 2002.
   On the other hand, the State of Senate has been analyzing a bill that sets directives for using the land in a sustainable way, by protecting against pollution, cleaning the contaminated sites up and fostering its reuse.
   As the redevelopment of brownfields is more complex than remediating a site, there is a need for cooperation between local and state agencies and also the establishment of a partnership between public and private organizations.
   While site remediation is a well known concept in Brazil, the redevelopment of such places poses challenges which have to be faced and gives opportunities to be explored, fulfilling the concept of sustainable development, by environmental protection, economic development and social equity in a heavily urbanized town.

SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) demands reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries, while developing countries are still permitted to expand their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; To identify, assess and compare options for avoiding and minimizing anthropogenic climate change, the framework of dynamic-game models (the SCX conflict model and the problem-specific TEM model) is applied to analyze the interaction between energy technologies, emission reductions and economic output with regard to energy use and the relationship between conflict and cooperation in climate policy.
   Basic variables are energy production, emissions into the environment, the energy price and the economic output. Major control parameters are the allocation of funding with regard to various energy options and the degree of international cooperation through technology transfer and capital flow. In particular, the impact of cooperation between industrialized and developing countries is evaluated to understand the role of governments in the transition to sustainable market economies.
   Simulations and numerical results are presented which can be used in a constructive way to implement a Joint-implementation Program as an advanced market institution.

Largely, the technology plans are influenced by factors that emanates from within the country (internal) and those outside of their borders (external). Internal factors include the high prices and low effectiveness of services provided by technology-related multinational corporations in DCs, the philosophical perspectives and priorities of organizations, foundations and development agencies promoting the implementation of ICTs in DCs, pilot programs without sustainability, uncoordinated pilot projects, selling of refurbished computers for use at a large scale, and dominance of the English language in the software. External factors include international summits and conferences, global partnerships and establishment of international organizations, and technology-related multinational corporations. To this end, this article is intended to stimulate reflections on the different factors that play an important role in the development and implementation of educational technology plans in Dcs.

TI Challenges and Prospects of Science Communication in South Asia
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
AB SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries live in various layers, such as social, cultural, political, religious, scientific, economical, and natural. The bilateral and multilateral sharing, exchange, interaction and communication between these layers can mark a turning point of the process of overall development of the region. Public communication of science and technology could be crucial and vital in this regard. Though, there exist a variety of programmes and activities for taking science to masses and inculcating a scientific bent of mind into them, generally, it was observed that all these layers are working in isolation and there is hardly any interaction. The present study discovers a range of modes and means of science communication prevalent in these countries and tries to identify some common threads to make them more interactive and communicative to each other. By this they can also reap the power of scientific knowledge and scientific wisdom. It emerged that science communication through various media, be it print, broadcast, digital, folk or interactive in developing countries, especially in SAARC region, i. e., Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri-Lanka deserves much more serious efforts to be able to enhance their abysmally low level of scientific literacy, eradicate superstitions, and achieve a baseline public understanding of science. It is high time to draw advantages from the programmes like Sixth Framework of the European Union especially meant for scientific cooperation (including science communication) between EU and developing countries. A close interaction and communication between these layers would make them more responsive to each other, paving the way to develop better understanding and cooperation leading to sustainable development.

   World's Perspective
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in September 2015 as a post 2015 development agenda. Goal 9 of the SDGs is to 'build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation'. Much has been written on the connection between intellectual property and development. With respect to developing countries, arguments have been canvassed both for and against intellectual property in the pursuit of their development goals. The adoption of the TRIPS Agreement in 1994 heralded a new era of global intellectual property governance aimed at a substantial harmonisation of intellectual property protection standards across the globe. This continues to raise continuing concerns in relation to the extent to which IP could foster development and industrialisation in developing countries and whether the global IP regime is designed in a way that sufficiently protects the interest of the developing and least developed nations. The development rhetoric is assuming an increasing significance in Africa given the continent's varying development challenges. This calls for some reflection on the interface between IP protection and the pursuit of sustainable human and economic development. The paper examines the link between intellectual property and health and how it relates to sustainable development in the African context.

TI Green and low carbon matters: A systematic review of the past, today,
   and future on sustainability supply chain management practices among
   manufacturing industry
SO CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Climate change has arisen as one of human beings' most significant threats. A higher proportion of carbon dioxide emissions are produced from developing countries as manufacturing globalization requires more and more emerging nations. The predicament between carbon reduction and fast industrial development makes firms in developing countries reluctant to take thoughtful commitment and actions in carbon dioxide emission reduction in their global manufacturing practices. Sustainability, green, and low-carbon supply chain networks research is still also in its infant stage from a theoretical perspective and requires further research and development. Therefore this research aims to address the research question: "Why and how organizations are adopting sustainable strategies in developing countries to increase sustainable supply chain management practices in the manufacturing?". In order to thoroughly analyse the literature, this paper used ATLAS.ti 9 software tools to save, identify, and assess the data for this study. We reviewed, compiled, and sorted papers from 326 publications for this article and then recognized 141 as critical to the work scope. The results reveal that the organization's current concentration is on improving internal environmental efficiency related to its mid-stream SCM activities. The introduction of environmental practices at the external level (downstream and upstream) is relatively limited, and few organizations are collaborating effectively with supply chain partners to improve their SSCM performance. The results also show that organizational performance, reputation/risk management, customer pressure, and top management support are primary motivators for organizations to embrace SSCM practices. The typology suggests that companies need to consider and recognize their key sustainability risk in the past, current, and future to have a simple organizational design to innovative management methods to handle their sustainable supply chain practices.

AB The Green and Sustainable Remediation (GSR) movement demands informed, integrated, and holistic management of contaminated sites. As such, GSR may become increasingly relevant in developing countries such as China, where vast areas of contaminated land require clean-up. Among other efforts, the World Bank together with China's Foreign Economic Cooperation Office is facilitating GSR adoption through the development of a guideline on social-environmental management. However, there are no existing studies that have considered how the established remediation industry perceives its effectiveness in addressing the various social-environmental management aspects, or how certain aspects have rooted. Without this information, it may be difficult to guide social-environmental practice forward, or introduce GSR into developing remediation markets with any precision. Therefore, a questionnaire survey of remediation participators was undertaken with principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the data to help group the various aspects. The PCA extracted two components for environmental management, ascribed to: (1) on-site/local impacts; and, (2) widespread impacts, and three social management components, ascribed to: (1) community inclusion; (2) economic gain; and, (3) health, safety, and welfare. It was found that the aspects the industry are most familiar with historically are generally dealt with more effectively than those that have only recently been introduced by the GSR movement. In particular, bolstering the management of widespread environmental impacts and giving greater regard to the economic gain of remediation, may be beneficial. In developing countries, public engagement is often very limited, necessitating improvement in remediation policy and guidance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The ecosystem approach to health is a promising strategy in
   international development: lessons from Japan and Laos
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: An ecological perspective was prominently present in the health promotion movement in the 1980s, but this seems to have faded. The burden of disease the developing world is facing cannot be addressed solely by reductionist approaches. Holistic approaches are called for that recognize the fundamentally interdependent nature of health and other societal, developmental, and ecosystem related factors in human communities. An ecosystem approach to human health (ecohealth) provides a good starting point to explore these interdependencies.
   Discussion: Development assistance is often based on the assumption that developed countries can serve as models for developing ones. Japan has provided lavish assistance to Laos for example, much of it going to the development of transport networks. However, there is little sign that there is an awareness of the potentially negative environmental and health impacts of this assistance. We argue that the health consequences of environmental degradation are not always understood, and that developing countries need to consider these issues. The ecohealth approach is useful when exploring this issue.
   We highlight three implications of the ecohealth approach: (1) The WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being emphasized that health is more than the absence of disease. However, because this approach may involve an unattainable goal, we suggest that health should be defined in the ecosystem context, and the goal should be to attain acceptable and sustainable levels of health through enabling people to realize decent livelihoods, and to pursue their life purpose; (2) The increasing interconnectedness of ecosystems in a globalizing world requires an ethical approach that considers human responsibility for the global biosphere. Here, ecohealth could be a countervailing force to our excessive concentration on economy and technology; and (3) If ecohealth is to become a positive agent of change in the global health promotion movement, it will have to find a secure place in the educational curriculum.
   Summary: This article presents a brief case study of Japan's development assistance to Laos, and its environmental and health implications, as an illustration of the ecohealth approach. We highlight three implications of the ecohealth perspective.

   Management in Phnom Penh, Cambodia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The overall responsibility for waste management in Phnom Penh Capital (PPC) has rested with the municipal authorities and contracted waste collection companies. Providing waste collection services is a major challenge for Phnom Penh due to the increasing waste volume and the deficiency of the system under public-private partnership. In response to continuing population growth and urbanization, sustainable management is necessary. This study reviewed the details of the processes and examined the performance of the private sector and local government authorities (LGAs). The study used sustainability assessment, according to a success and efficiency factor method. This assessment method was developed to support solid waste management in developing countries. Multiple sustainability domains were evaluated: institutional, legislative, technical, environmental and health aspects as well as social, economic, financial and critical aspects. The results indicate that the long-term contract design attempts for partnership may actually result in a worsening of the situation by facilitating new ways of concentration, inefficiency and political interest. The limited institutional capacity of the public sectors is a consequence of the inefficient decentralization of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) policies. Public-private partnerships can be neither effective nor sustainable if LGAs and CINTRI co. Ltd. waste collection company do not build proper incentives into their management of the two sectors. Revisiting the legal framework, establishing a facilitating agency that will assist in the design and the nurturing of partnerships, competitive tendering, and transparency and financial accountability are essential elements for PPP on the provision of waste services in PPC.

TI Barriers to sustainable construction project management: the case of
   Iran
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose The barriers to integrating sustainable practices into construction project management require extensive resource allocations to resolve. Within developing countries such as Iran (where resources are scarce), remedial strategies adopted must prioritise tackling those barriers that can be expected to yield maximum return on investment. The candidate barriers are many, and this paper aims to identify a hierarchy of barriers, providing a priority list of remedial targets. Design/methodology/approach A mixed philosophical stance of interpretivism and post-positivism is adopted within a deductive approach and survey strategy. A list of 30 known barriers are identified from extant literature and used to formulate a questionnaire data collection instrument administered within the Iranian construction industry. Data collected from 176 practitioners are analysed using the relative importance index and Mann-Whitney U test to compare groups based on the participants' demographic variables. Findings The findings challenge the common assumption that items related to market and workforce experience are major inhibitors of change. That is, economics and regulatory dependent barriers have a higher impact on the failure of a shift to sustainable practices in Iran. The most influential barriers to incorporating sustainability in construction projects are: (1) lack of understanding of the potential benefits; (2) insufficient cooperation among practitioners, research institutions and environmental organisations; and (3) a lack of a systematic approach to pursuing sustainability goals. No significant associations are detected between the affiliation of the respondents and their attitude towards the issue. Thus, a generalised approach can be applied to a broader range of organisations and construction projects in Iran. Originality/value While studies on sustainability impediments at the firm or project level are ubiquitous within literature, this research identifies that the most significant barriers to sustainable project management in Iran, as an underexplored context, are those experienced at the economic and institutional level. Moreover, this novel research presents important insights into the potential effects of participants' demographic profiles on their view of the importance of identified barriers.

TI Analysing inter-relationships among water, governance, human development
   variables in developing countries
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB The "Integrated Water Resources Management" principle was formally laid down at the International Conference on Water and Sustainable development in Dublin 1992. One of the main results of this conference is that improving Water and Sanitation Services (WSS), being a complex and interdisciplinary issue, passes through collaboration and coordination of different sectors (environment, health, economic activities, governance, and international cooperation). These sectors influence or are influenced by the access to WSS. The understanding of these interrelations appears as crucial for decision makers in the water sector. In this framework, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) has developed a new database (WatSan4Dev database) containing 42 indicators (called variables in this paper) from environmental, socio-economic, governance and financial aid flows data in developing countries. This paper describes the development of the WatSan4Dev dataset, the statistical processes needed to improve the data quality, and finally, the analysis to verify the database coherence is presented. Based on 25 relevant variables, the relationships between variables are described and organised into five factors (HDP - Human Development against Poverty, AP - Human Activity Pressure on water resources, WR - Water Resources, ODA - Official Development Aid, CEC - Country Environmental Concern). Linear regression methods are used to identify key variables having influence on water supply and sanitation. First analysis indicates that the informal urbanisation development is an important factor negatively influencing the percentage of the population having access to WSS. Health, and in particular children's health, benefits from the improvement of WSS. Irrigation is also enhancing Water Supply service thanks to multi-purpose infrastructure. Five country profiles are also created to deeper understand and synthetize the amount of information gathered. This new classification of countries is useful in identifying countries with a less advanced position and weaknesses to be tackled. The relevance of indicators gathered to represent environmental and water resources state is questioned in the discussion section. The paper concludes with the necessity to increase the reliability of current indicators and calls for further research on specific indicators, in particular on water quality at national scale, in order to better include environmental state in analysis to WSS.

TI The hybrid model for economic regulation of water utilities: Mission
   impossible?
SO UTILITIES POLICY
AB The two main approaches to economic regulation regulation by contract and regulation by agency-may both encounter significant challenges in regulating public-private partnerships when institutions are weak. As a result, the hybrid model, a mixture of elements from both systems, is widespread. This paper considers hybrid regulation as a distinct regulatory model. A case study of water services regulation in Manila from 1997 to 2015 suggests that hybrid regulation is both possible and compelling. Yet, while it might help to expedite private-sector involvement initially, fundamental tensions between the two underlying approaches may undermine PPP sustainability if not addressed appropriately at the outset.

   competences of economics students to a global issue
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB The UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals determine the global development objectives for the period of 2016-2030. Universities play an exceptional role in raising global citizens. Due to changes in the attitudes of young people, concepts such as student-centered education, collabo-rative and active learning, and flipped classrooms have become key terms in education. In this paper, we combine these two areas (educational methods and global citizenship education), and aim to assess how flipped classrooms in university education can contribute to improving global citizenship competences of young people on the issues of developing countries. A pilot research project was conducted at a Hungarian university with the involvement of 44 bachelor's-degree students. The project was based on the flipped classroom method with input and output tests, and it concentrated on the dimension of global competencies in global citizenship. The results confirmed that the level of global competencies can be improved by a university course, though the final results were not as strong as expected.

AB Industrialization in developing countries is rapidly advancing and causing serious environmental problems and exhaustion of resources in some areas. Japan has enforced many kinds of ODA(Official Development Assistance) programs and tried to raise the assistance rate. A country's ability to develop itself more sustainable depends on the capacity of its people and institutions to understand complex environment and developmental issues that enable them in making the right development choices. The objective of this work is to find what Japan should do in technical cooperations with developing countries on solid waste management which includes generation, collection, transportation, processing and final disposal system of solid waste as well as resource recycling recovery system, from the view point of balance between environment and socio-economic development.

   Engagement in a Frontier Market
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB How to achieve sustainable communities with decent work and economic growth without negative environmental impact, is at the heart of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and a top priority of many governments around the world. This article critically explores the role of government intervention for achieving sustainable local prosperity in frontier markets of developing countries, where such advancement is especially crucial. More specifically, we explore by an in-depth case study how multiple stakeholders cooperate to enhance local development and export from firms in the leather and leather products industry in Ethiopia. From a multistakeholder engagement perspective, including representatives of local businesses, United Nations, Ministry of Trade and Industry, and other development partners, we analyze how government interventions have resulted in unintended outcomes despite their good intention. We contribute with a new understanding of why development initiatives in frontier markets struggle with stakeholder integration, caused by power asymmetry and lack of institutional trust which prevents the achievements of sustainable development goals. Contextualized implications for firms, government, and non-governmental actors on how to improve collaboration are provided, and policy implications are proposed.

TI A review of plastic waste circular actions in seven developing countries
   to achieve sustainable development goals
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Plastic waste circularity is a priority at a global level. Sustainable development goals (SDGs) set the ways to go, and the circular economy principles underlined the 'green' strategies to be employed. However, in practice, there is still much to do, especially in developing countries, where open burning and open dumping still represent the common way of plastic waste disposal. This review aims to analyse current plastic waste circular approaches in low-middle income settings. Seven countries were selected based on the economic level and data availability from the authors, and analysed to collect and critically discuss the actions implemented at a city level. Examples of waste minimization and recycling strategies, selective collection systems and public campaigns are reported from Africa, Asia and Latin America. First, a background analysis related to physical and governance aspects of municipal solid waste management systems of the chosen settings was conducted. The assessment was focused on the treatment processes or minimization actions. Then, the applicability of the projects to achieve the SDGs was commented on. The outcomes of the research underline the need to: (1) scale up small-scale and pilot projects, (2) disseminate good practices in more low- to middle-income settings, (3) create synergies among international partners for further replications in cities. Urgent solutions to plastic waste pollution are needed. The review presented practical actions to be implemented now to boost plastic waste circularity in developing cities.

   output gap and the current account?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Estimates of the output gap are useful for identifying the sustainable level of noninflationary output growth in countries with a flexible exchange rate regime. For nations with a fixed exchange rate, however, domestic prices are inexorably linked to the prices of its main trading partners and are unlikely to bear little relation to the output gap. This article uses data on 45 developed and developing countries between 1970 and 2004 to show that a positive output gap in a country with a fixed exchange rate is more liable to be reflected in an imbalance on the external current account.

TI Examining Stakeholders' Perceptions of Mining Impacts and Corporate

SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper aims to provide a better understanding of multistakeholder perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in connection with mining industry impacts. While there is significant research about CSR, there is a lack of understanding in the area of specific stakeholders' perceptions within the extractive industry, particularly in a developing country like Chile. The findings reveal that stakeholders perceive mining impacts on social and environmental domains negatively in contrast to a positive perception about economic impacts. CSR is addressed in terms of social and environmental responsibilities, but is also perceived negatively as mere rhetoric, or simply as a marketing campaign. These perceptions reflect an anti-trade-off sentiment, revealing that CSR cannot be used as a tool to compensate negative mining impacts. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

TI Blind spots in climate finance for innovation
SO ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB International climate finance is a sub-set of green finance and refers to investments specifically in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, which primarily involve public finance and the leveraging of private finance in developing countries. In addition to continued international support for scaling low carbon solutions and facilitating replicability in developing countries, there remains an important need to increase the amount of climate finance provided to innovation, particularly demonstration (for technology innovation) and pilot implementation (for policy innovation), and to channel a greater proportion of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to 'hard-to-abate' areas, such as industrial decarbonisation, international transport and cross-sectoral issues like cooling and behavioural insights, to accelerate the commercialisation and implementation of technological, financial and policy solutions to contribute to meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 'well-below' 2 degrees C in these countries. Linking research, development and demonstration (RD&D) support with technical assistance is important in providing the route to obtain wider donor finance (concessional finance) and private finance to enable deployment through scalability and replicability.

TI Beyond "safe": Chilean "Kool" routes to school address social
   determinants of health
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH
AB An abundant literature has examined the usefulness of "safe routes to school" programs to increase active transport (mainly walking and cycling) and with it levels of physical activity, hence health. To date, these have been applied mainly in the Global North, where they are supported by national networks and government.
   Conditions in developing countries differ. While the obesity epidemic is rife, the sustainability trio of walk-bike-bus/Metro account for high percentages (66% or more) of daily travel (LTAA-cademy, Singapore, 2011). In a rapidly urbanizing world, with 90% of its population already living in cities, Chile offers an excellent opportunity to study these issues. Both adults and children in Chile have extremely high rates of sedentarism (over 90%), overweight and obesity. This raises interesting questions about the potential impacts of programs focusing on active transport for school children in the Global South.
   This research originally sought to explore potential for improving physical activity. Working with teachers, principals, local government and students in one of Chile's most vulnerable municipal jurisdictions, we created a program to raise awareness of sustainable transport impacts on children's health and happiness. As the program advanced, partners requested a broader agenda of participatory planning to transform territories around schools.
   Findings to date reveal considerable potential for transformation in challenging spheres, including gender roles, gender-related violence and social insecurity, road safety, traffic calming, environmental and civic education. This suggests that, at least in developing countries, cocreating and innovating to achieve suitable adaptations of these programs with local actors should receive careful attention, to mobilize their potential for generating responses to a broader public policy agenda, able to address the social determinants of health.

AB The Kyoto Protocol (KP) cooperation mechanisms present local and national institutional and legal challenges, especially to developing countries like South Africa. One of the cooperation mechanisms in which greenhouse gases (GHGs) will be reduced from the atmosphere through the KP is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM permits developed countries to invest in projects that reduce GHGs in developing countries and earn carbon credits. The CDM is documented as one of the new investment avenues in developing countries with huge amounts of foreign direct investment predicted till 2012. South Africa has scored a first in having a registered CDM project in Africa. The country's CDM project implementation institutional set-up (that draws across many government departments, NGOs, civil and the private sector) presents a valuable experience not only to the African continent but other developing countries. In addition, legal provisions ranging from the National Environmental Management Act, through the Regulations for the Establishment of the Designated National Authority (DNA) and the Sustainable Development Criteria for CDM projects cannot be overemphasised. This paper therefore gives an analysis of such, including the manner in which the publics are involved in the process of CDM project approval processes.

TI Broken food supply chains: Priority norms for exchange partnerships in
   developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The purpose of this research is to examine the challenges and opportunities behind developing a collaborative food supply chain (FSC) in the context of Punjab, India. To achieve the purpose, we use relational exchange theory (RET). We adopted a mixed-methods approach, including focus groups and observations. We analyzed the data to identify themes and in particular, the RET norms that inductively emerged. We found several challenges to building collaborative FSC partnerships. The challenges were especially the domination of FSCs by limited information exchange and power imbalances, characterized by limited role integrity and large transaction commitment effects. Guided by the RET, our findings demonstrate a need to prioritize partnership solidarity, information exchange, reciprocal benefits within deep collaborative FSC partnerships, and at the same time, restrain power advantages. Using RET, we contribute to understanding FSCs in developing countries by demonstrating that there is a staged norm demonstration to initiate and build collaborative exchange partner-ships; a small set of specific norms need to be established to initiate collaborative FSC partnerships. We also see that intermediaries have a debilitating effect on initiating collaborative FSC partnerships, and as such should be removed to facilitate direct relationships between supply chain partners.

TI Formation of a sustainable development ecosystem for Ghanaian
   universities
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB Research in the field of sustainable development (SD) in many developing countries remains multifaceted and discipline-oriented, especially at the institutional level where researchers and practitioners regularly produce research outputs to inform policy decisions aimed at meeting the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although a number of seminal research studies have focused on incorporating aspects of SD in higher education institutions through curriculum development and partnerships, there are still challenges with regard to the uptake of SD practices by universities in Ghana, West Africa - the focus of the study presented in this article - as well as in many other developing countries. For his study, the author undertook a systematic review of the literature on sustainability research in the context of Ghana, particularly in relation to higher education. His literature review revealed that a lack of understanding of education for sustainable development (ESD) by many individuals and institutions is creating a gap in knowledge and practice within the higher education landscape. To address this problem, the author proposes the adoption of an "ecosystem" that integrates (1) research networks; (2) national SD activities; (3) institutional structures and leadership; and (4) the ESD concept of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs into the curricula of Ghanaian universities. The author suggests that such an ecosystem could encourage a collegial environment that supports the exchange of SD ideas and skills among staff and students. In addition, the SD ecosystem could provide a framework for developing students' knowledge and skills in line with global SD agendas, while also heightening research networks both locally and internationally, and ensuring that universities adopt research-informed SD practices.

TI A Socio-Cognitive Approach to the Communication of SME Support. An
   Exploratory Qualitative Study in Turkmenistan
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ASIAN CONTEXT
SE Communication Culture and Change in Asia
AB Certain researchers call to reconsider Communication for development and social change as a problem of "Techniques and Society" (McArthur, Jouet, Bardini, Lohento, Kiyindou, Misse). Thus, the models of social integration of innovations are used here to study how the new development assistance modules are accepted and appropriated by their final users in developing countries. There is no need to prove anymore that users' reception and appropriation of the proposed service is critical to the development programs' effectiveness, be it in public health, environmental issues, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, or other. We synthesize the Anglo-Saxon and French models and distinguish the common determinant axes for the innovations or novelties reception: before their actual use (acceptance models) and after it (appropriation models). The common base appears to be the mental construction of the sense of use: the user mobilizes his representations "already there" (anchoring in existing representations, Moscovici, Jodelet, LeBlanc) and his imaginary (Flichy, Musso) to assess the associated use benefitscosts, the anticipated-perceived use experience. In the literature, this mental construction process is theorized as the formation of the Perceived Value of Use (PVU) (Jouet, Mallein and Toussaint, Mallein et coll., Toussaint, Boenisch, Assude et al, Nelson, Kim et al.). However, it is necessary to further explore this process. Eager to explore the PVU concept in detail, we conducted a two-phase field qualitative study within the SME support sector (UN Sustainable Development Goals 8.3 and 9.3), in Turkmenistan, Central Asia. Our results suggest that we can model the PVU formation mechanism, and its role in the cognitive appropriation and acceptance of the new support services by the final users. We propose to test the results of our research, within the context of other developing countries and of other sectors.

TI Post-2015 Development Agenda: From Concept to Practice
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB The latest progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) shows that MDGs have made a profound difference in people's lives, which is the most important achievement of international development cooperation in past 15 years. Based on experience of formulation and implementation of MDGs, United Nations launched international processes of the Post-2015 Development Agenda including negotiations to define Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, comparing processes defining MDGs and SDGs, some new characteristics were identified and some key issues were analyzed. It seems difficult to balance interests of developed and developing countries and there are also great challenges to implement SDGs effectively in the future especially in developing countries. It required building a new global partnership for sustainable development to promote transformation.

TI The contribution of space for a more sustainable earth: leveraging space
   to achieve the sustainable development goals
SO GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Non-technical summary. This article raises awareness of how countries can leverage space and space technologies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through concrete examples. Space science, technology and applications can support a range of pro-developmental activities, such as agricultural planning, biodiversity protection, tele-health and disaster management. United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) helps countries to use space technology in all of these areas, through capacity building and partnerships with government and private sector entities to expand access to space, especially for developing countries. This article also outlines the work of UNOOSA in promoting increased participation of women in the space sector and in STEM careers.
   Technical summary. This article presents the mandate of UNOOSA and its activities to improve awareness and use of space and space technologies for achieving the SDGs. This article presents examples of UNOOSA work in this respect. One example of this work is the Human Space Technology Initiative (HSTI), which aims to involve more countries in activities related to human space flight. One of the flagship HSTI activities is the KiboCUBE programme, a partnership with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that offers institutions from developing countries the opportunity to deploy 1U (1 Unit) cube satellites from the Japanese Kibo module of the International Space Station (ISS). Other HSTI activities include the partnership between UNOOSA and the China Manned Space Agency to give countries opportunities to fly experiments onboard China's Space Station, as well as partnerships with private firms such as Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) to fly experiments onboard SNC's DreamChaser (R) spacecraft. Through its UN-SPIDER programme, UNOOSA helps countries use space technology (in particular satellites) to prevent and manage disasters. Through its Space for Women project, UNOOSA promotes the increased participation of women in space and STEM careers. Through increased international cooperation and partnerships, space can make a difference for achieving all the SDGs.

TI Strategic Approaches to Sustainable Urban Renewal in Developing
   Countries: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Successful urban renewal requires a multifaceted strategic approach incorporating both local and regional regulations, developed through multi-sector and multi-agency partnerships. In practice, developments in China unfold as discrete projects without a broader consideration for city planning or long-term sustainability. Critically, no strategic manifesto has yet emerged to direct sustainable urban renewal (SUR) as a whole in Chinese cities. To improve understanding of existing practices and their applicability to current issues facing urban renewal programs, this study performs a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of urban renewal within Shenzhen City, China. Data identifying specific strategies are collected from a literature review, relevant urban renewal regulations, government documents, interviews with experts and focus group meetings. Findings identify six potential strategies able to uphold SUR development in Shenzhen, with further transferability to other Chinese cities.

TI Managing the global commons: common good or common sink?
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB The global commons, comprising the areas and resources beyond the sovereignty of any state, build upon the heritage of Grotius's idea of mare liberum - an idea that aimed to preserve the freedom of access for the benefit of all. However, the old mare liberum idea digressed into 'first come, first served' advantages for industrialised countries. Especially at the initiative of developing countries, it has now been replaced by a new law of international cooperation and protection of natural wealth and resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The global commons have thus served as the laboratory for testing new legal principles and the rights and corollary duties emanating from them. Occasionally path-breaking innovations in regulation have been practised, most notably the imposition of a ban on whaling, penalties for the production and use of ozone-depleting substances and the freezing of claims to sovereignty over Antarctica.

TI Trends of improved water and sanitation coverage around the globe
   between 1990 and 2010: inequality among countries and performance of
   official development assistance
SO GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB Background: As the Millennium Development Goals ended, and were replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals, efforts have been made to evaluate the achievements and performance of official development assistance (ODA) in the health sector. In this study, we explore trends in the expansion of water and sanitation coverage in developing countries and the performance of ODA.
   Design: We explored inequality across developing countries by income level, and investigated how ODA for water and sanitation was committed by country, region, and income level. Changes in inequality were tested via slope changes by investigating the interaction of year and income level with a likelihood ratio test. A random effects model was applied according to the results of the Hausman test.
   Results: The slope of the linear trend between economic level and sanitation coverage has declined over time. However, a random effects model suggested that the change in slope across years was not significant (e.g. for the slope change between 2000 and 2010: likelihood ratio X-2 = 2.49, probability > X-2 = 0.1146). A similar pro-rich pattern across developing countries and a non-significant change in the slope associated with different economic levels were demonstrated for water coverage. Our analysis shows that the inequality of water and sanitation coverage among countries across the world has not been addressed effectively during the past decade. Our findings demonstrate that the countries with the least coverage persistently received far less ODA per capita than did countries with much more extensive water and sanitation coverage, suggesting that ODA for water and sanitation is poorly targeted.
   Conclusion: The most deprived countries should receive more attention for water and sanitation improvements from the world health community. A strong political commitment to ODA targeting the countries with the least coverage is needed at the global level.

JICA led the negotiations of the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, as a main member of the government of Japan. The Sustainable Development Goals' demand to 'leave no one behind' requires that the social system protect even the poorest people who live in disaster-prone areas. Local disaster risk reduction planning plays an indispensable role; and JICA wrote an eight-step methodology to formulate these plans. The emphasis in each country needs to shift from planning to implementation.

AB The aim of this chapter is to provide a conceptual framework to help mitigate the risks of interventions to promote bioenergy development in developing countries which still have substantial amount of biomass resources. Biotechnology is increasingly recognized as a critical aspect of the development process, especially with the growing awareness of the role of science, technology and innovation in economic renewal. There are technological and economic challenges that have to be overcome in developing sustainable bioenergy production systems. The need to build capacity to harness biomass for bio-fuels and other forms of bio-energy through biotechnology and bioengineering, but without harming the natural resource base upon which life depends, is highlighted. In the context of globalization, this chapter calls on developing countries, especially from the tropics, and their development partners, to take advantage of abundant biomass resources and develop appropriate technologies for bioenergy production that will improve their incomes and alleviate poverty levels in the region. Conservation and rational utilization of natural resources in Africa and other communities throughout the world require the involvement of all stakeholders, regional and international cooperation and private-sector investment. Although there seems to be potential in developing bionenergy in the continent of Africa, it is not possible at this time to assess the balance of benefits and costs. However, there are undoubtedly risks entailed in the application of the technologies now being developed, and African countries need a way to assess these risks and try to reduce them, since it seems inevitable that international agencies, companies and governments are going to push ahead with applying biotechnologies in the region. The need for a conceptual framework as a starting point to identifying and reducing risks associated with bio-energy development is highlighted.

TI How Will COVID-19 Impact on the Governance of Global Health in the 2030
   Agenda Framework? The Opinion of Experts
SO HEALTHCARE
AB In 2015, the 2030 Agenda was formally adopted by the United Nations, establishing a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 3 seeks to promote Global Health and the quality of public health systems in developing countries. The achievement of these goals requires the commitment of all signing countries, but the COVID-19 crisis is changing the behavior of the main stakeholders in the international arena. What do the experts think about these changes? Could these changes threaten the 2030 Agenda and Global Health? To answer these questions, we conduct a content analysis of 152 documents written by experts from the 15 main think tanks on international development policy. The results point out that the new scenario brought about by the pandemic is hindering the necessary cooperation between countries to achieve global health goals and to guarantee public health coverage in developing countries. To deal with these challenges, more delegation of powers to international organizations and a reform of the international cooperation system are needed. With this analysis, we launch a warning about potential weaknesses of the institutional design of the 2030 Agenda in order for it to survive in a post-COVID-19 world and remain a valid instrument to promote health worldwide.

AB Developmental Aid Programs or what is normally referred to as Official Development Assistance (ODA), plays a key role in the growth process of many underdeveloped and developing countries. However, with a recent growing scarcity of resources and a general call for strict accountability from aid-recipient countries, there has been some interests in the design of aid performance evaluation methodologies or tools. To deepen such interests, this paper proposes a hybrid Fuzzy AHP Synthetic Extent-PROMETHEE framework of how aid-recipient countries could be evaluated and selected in developmental aid programs. With the use of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) set of subjective criteria for evaluating aid programs, a decision framework pre-defined by linguistic terms of triangular fuzzy number format is provided for such selection decision problem. The framework serves to deepen transparency, fairness, value for money and sustainability of development aid programs.

TI The impact of market-oriented cooperation on food production performance
   in small-scale farms in rural China
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB IntroductionSmall-scale farmers in developing countries can significantly contribute to sustainable food production through market-oriented cooperation (MOC). MOC allows farmers to access machinery services and specialized labor, but it also carries economic costs that may impact food production performance in small-scale farms. This study attempts to uncover the association between farmers' MOC participation and food production performance in small-scale farms in rural China, using a sample of 650 rice farmers in Jiangsu province. MethodsWe applied the stochastic frontier analysis to calculate the technical efficiency that indicates the production performance of small-scale farms. The treatment effect model is employed to detect the effect of farmers' MOC participation on technical efficiency, and the multivalued treatment effects model is used to explore the relationship between farmers' intensity of MOC and technical efficiency. ResultsThe results show that farmers' MOC participation significantly increases technical efficiency of small-scale farms, with an inverted U-shaped correlation between MOC participation intensity and technical efficiency. A heterogeneity analysis based on production phases reveals that farmers tend to adopt MOC in machinery-driven phases with higher priority than in labor-driven phases. MOC in labor-driven phases, such as seedling and spraying, presents negative effect on technical efficiency. DiscussionThese findings highlight the crucial role of MOC in food production performance in small-scale farms, and provide insights for designing MOC strategies in different production phases in order to facilitate sustainable food production in developing regions. This research addresses the need for solutions to improve food production sustainability under agricultural transformation in developing countries. It also touches on the challenges and opportunities that producers face in adopting new practices and participating in the modern food supply chain.

   Factories: Empirical Evidence from the Garment Industry of Bangladesh
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Ergonomics is a key concern of garment suppliers to improve their workers' well-being and efficiency. However, suppliers' isolated initiatives are not sufficient to improve ergonomics conditions. Thus, buyers' cooperation and collaboration with suppliers are necessary to make the ergonomic initiatives successful and sustainable. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of buyer-assisted ergonomics intervention on suppliers' performance and the role of buyers' assistance and suppliers' initiatives for improving ergonomics conditions in garment supplier factories. Following a qualitative research approach and multiple embedded case study method, this study intervened in supplier factories and collected qualitative and quantitative data from one Danish buyer and their four key suppliers on ergonomics and the role of buyers and suppliers in improving ergonomics conditions. Collected data were analysed by employing both quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques. This study demonstrates that buyer-assisted ergonomics intervention on the shop floor can improve ergonomics conditions in garment supplier factories. This study also shows that improving ergonomics in supplier factories need joint efforts of buyers and suppliers. The findings of this study will enrich the literature on ergonomics, sustainability, and buyer-supplier relationships by demonstrating how garment suppliers in developing countries can improve ergonomics to meet the expectations of lead buyers and their workers. This is a unique research attempt to understand ergonomics from a buyer-supplier relationship perspective and its impact on the social sustainability of garment suppliers.

TI The First Five Decades of Cooperation for Development. Actors,
   Achievements and Challenges
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB The sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development collectively serve as a universal guide for developed and developing countries in their national policies and international cooperation aimed at combating global challenges. The SDGs build on the outcomes of the Global Partnership for Development Co-operation (GPEDC), the foundations of which were laid in the 20th century. This article explores the system of international development cooperation as it evolved in the UN from 1946 until the adoption of the UN Millennium Declaration in 2000. It analyzes the resolutions and official records of the main UN bodies, with emphasis on the General Assembly (GA) and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Content analysis of the records reveals the delegations' positions, interests, contradictions and tensions which may have been concealed by the smooth text of the resolutions.
   Four development decades culminated in adoption of the Millennium Declaration. Each stage had its achievements and problems. The main principles, mechanisms and areas of cooperation were molded in early sessions of the GA and ECOSOC. The creation of development support instruments began in mid-1940s, when the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and later the UN Special Fund were established. The dollar monopoly was entrenched. The expansion of international trade and removal of barriers to trade issues gained prominence in UN resolutions in the 1950s. In 1960 the goal of increasing flows of assistance and capital to developing countries to 1% of the combined national incomes of economically developed countries was set for the first time.
   The period from 1961-1970 was marked by the adoption of the Programme for International Development Co-operation - including the First United Nations Development Decade and the World Food Programme (WFP), the establishment of the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and by the elaboration of the international development strategy for the second development decade. The need for international monetary reform was debated in conjunction with the UN's pursuit of a solution to the problems of rising debt and international liquidity.
   The key milestones of the second decade include the gradual integration of development and environment issues, efforts to resolve the international monetary crisis and alleviate the rising debt burden, an increase of pledged targets for the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the WFP and Special Fund, the decision on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, efforts to implement the differential treatment principle with regard to developing countries within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, and a failed attempt to launch "global negotiations on restructuring of international economic relations on the basis of the principles of justice and equality in order to provide for steady economic development."
   In the third decade, progress was made toward strengthening the science and technology capacity as well as the industrial and resource development capacity of developing countries. The UN endorsed the Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000, adopted the Declaration on the Right to Development and the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. The transition to a sustainable development model was a major achievement. The economic recession, high rates of interest, inflation and mounting deficits, the problems of liquidity and balance of payments, protectionism and structural imbalances in the world economy required a comprehensive decision on the reform of the international monetary system. However, global negotiations were deadlocked due to the position taken by the Group of 7 (G7) that the independence of the specialized agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be guaranteed. Despite efforts by the Group of 77 (G77) to deal comprehensively with the full range of economic issues, the G7's insistence on the 1982 Versailles summit formula blocked global negotiations, defining the system's rigidity for many years to come and contributing to its failure to prevent the 1998 and 2008 crises.
   The Agenda for Development adopted in June 1997 and the UN Millennium Declaration adopted in September 2000 became the landmarks of the fourth decade and development cooperation history.
   The international community came a long way in building and consolidating development cooperation in the second half of the 20th century. The UN became a cradle and a driver of this process and was a factor in its success. Indisputable achievements resulting from collective efforts over 55 years include a consistent consolidation of its foundational programme documents from the first development decade to the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs), continuous improvement of the review and appraisal process, integration of environmental issues into the development agenda, establishment of key development cooperation institutions and a significant increase in financing for development. However, efforts to create the conditions for sustained progress and development restructuring of the international economic system taking account of the interests of developing countries failed. The 21st century inherited the systemic problems of the international monetary and trade systems.

TI Healthcare in developing countries and the role of business: a global
   governance framework to enhance the accountability of pharmaceutical
   companies
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to defend the appropriateness of a global governance framework for the transnational pharmaceutical corporations (TNPCs) as a way to tackle the problems resulting out of a non-implementation or violation of the "right to health'' by a lack of accessibility of vital medicines in developing countries, and control the risks of the TNPCs themselves and to provide for more accountability and trust on their part. The aim is to show that such a framework can prepare the ground for a win-win-situation for all stakeholders and for a sustainable combination of interests in profits, human rights, especially the "right to health'', and human welfare.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper on the basis of step-by-step analytical and interdiscinplinary approach that requires to pick up arguments from economics, business ethics, law, political science as well as aspects of the human rights and the health governance discourse. A broad spectrum of literature and various information sources are referred to: scientific articles and monographs, newspaper and magazine articles, internet sources and information provided by the corporations themselves and by NGOs (non-governmental organizations), as well as recent academic and institutional publications. Desk research is the underlying technique to analyze the sources in a heuristic and interpretative way. For a better understanding, first the complexity of the implementation of "the right to health'' and the role of different actors will be outlined and second, advantages, positive impacts and deficits of existing health-related CSR (corporate social responsibility) and multistakeholder initiatives by the TNPCs will be pointed out. This is to prepare a ground for arguing in favor of a global governance framework for the TNPCs and to underline the existence of external and internal drivers for the TNPCs to adhere to a global governance framework.
   Findings - Especially in developing countries the "right to health'' is poorly implemented. TNPCs could contribute to improvements and partly already do so. Yet, the existing approaches are deficitary, insufficient and not sustainable. The problem calls for more accountability in regard to the access to vital medicines. A global governance frameworks for the TNPCs would pose a win-win-opportunity: While the TNPCs can benefit from more accountability, precisely defined responsibilities as well as efficiency by constructive, strategic partnerships on a stable level-playing-field and a legitimized conduct, their stakeholders benefit from an improved accessibility to vital medicines and an enhanced implementation of the "right to health''.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on how to improve the implementation of "right to health'' by improving the accessibility of vital medicines, especially in developing (and emerging) countries. It proposes new modes of CSR-based conduct and partnerships of the TNPCs and a framework of global governance that are urgently required to tackle with a long-term perspective the problems and threats that pandemics pose on a global scale and to cut down risks for the TNPCs while also widening their markets.

TI A model for improving physician performance in developing countries: A
   three-year postgraduate training program in Laos
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB The Faculty of Medical Sciences of the National University of Laos, in partnership with Health Frontiers, an American nonprofit organization, Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland, Ohio, and Khon Kaen University of Khon Kaen, Thailand, administer a postgraduate internal medicine training program for Lao physicians. Begun in 2001, the program admits six participants per year; participants complete clinical rotations in three hospitals in Vientiane, Laos, as well as one other clinical site.
   The goal of the program is to prepare a core group of local physicians to deliver healthcare, and train others according to an international standard of care. The program has two exceptional features. First, the vast majority of the training takes place in Laos. This avoids the "brain drain" that can occur when nationals of developing countries train abroad. In addition, because the training uses personnel, facilities, and technology available locally, graduates are better prepared to serve the needs of the Lao people. Second, the partnership is an all-volunteer model, committed to a long-term undertaking. American-trained specialists who live in Laos are available to work with the participants on a daily basis. Participants have a long period of time to acquire, reinforce, and be tested in new knowledge and benefit from learning from American colleagues who model an evidence-based approach to medical care, while still working in local conditions. As more Lao physicians receive this level of training, the program will become locally sustainable and help break a cycle of dependency on foreign expertise within the Lao health care sector. Preliminary results suggest that the program is succeeding, and could be replicated elsewhere.

TI Factors Influencing International Infrastructure Investment: An
   Empirical Study from Chinese Investors
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB International economic cooperation accelerates the flow of capital, technology, labor, and other factors between different countries, which promotes global sustainable development. Building infrastructure construction is an important way to strengthen social development, and absorbing foreign capital is an effective way for developing countries to improve their infrastructure and to promote economic development. This study puts forward the factors that have influenced China's investment in international engineering projects, and it constructs a panel data regression model for empirical testing. The study shows that, first, international infrastructure investment tends to select countries or regions with good condition of highway infrastructure. Second, international infrastructure investment tends to choose countries or regions with low development level of port and power infrastructure. Third, bilateral diplomatic visits play a significant role in promoting international infrastructure investment. Fourth, international infrastructure investment tends to choose countries or regions with good resource endowment. This study reveals the influencing factors and the mechanisms for the choices of location for China's investment in international engineering projects, providing a theoretical framework for investors to optimize international infrastructure investment and management, as well as providing the policy references for developing countries to attract international infrastructure investment.

TI Partnerships for solid waste management in developing countries: linking
   theories to realities
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Both public and private sectors are active in management of solid waste in developing countries. There is an emerging trend in encouraging the private sector to enter into solid waste management (SWM) operations, and attempts are being made to formally link the public and private sector operators. Such linkages may improve the efficiency of the entire sector and create new opportunities for employment. However, any change in the present order may inevitably affect the lives of millions of most vulnerable and marginalised population in the cities of the developing counties-both as users and providers of the service. It is worth revisiting the fundamentals of partnerships from the perspective of relevant theories. Two pertinent sociological theories, functionalism and general systems, view institutions as composed of interdependent parts that must adapt to survive in a changing world. The economic theory of property rights assigns rights of ownership as the reason for the private sector to excel. Economists also argue that hybrid organisations composed of both public and private sector hold a great deal of promise. These hybrid sector organisations provide a means to combine the efficiency and expertise of the business world with public interest, accountability and broader planning of government. These new organisations are important as alternatives, not replacing the existing order, but balancing the roles played by the public and private sector agencies. The competition theory of management science may be adapted to the concept of complementation in place of the traditional view of competition. This theory explores the values of cooperation among organisations to best exploit the comparative advantage of each. In the light of above theories, this paper analyses the possibilities for public/private partnership using the example of SWM as a sub-sector. The paper discusses necessary conditions for harnessing optimal benefits from this arrangement. Poorly designed attempts for partnership may actually worsen the situation by opening new avenues of inefficiency and corruption. Other caveats and barriers for integration are also presented. The paper concludes that partnerships will not be effective and sustainable unless proper incentives for both sectors are built into the design. Finally, the authors debate whether there is a need for a facilitating agency for designing and nurturing partnerships. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Issues, challenges, opportunities and sustainable strategy for the
   implementation of hybrid imaging SPECT/CT in a country with limited
   medical resources; Cote d'Ivoire
SO MEDECINE NUCLEAIRE-IMAGERIE FONCTIONNELLE ET METABOLIQUE
AB From HO Anger's analogic gamma camera to digital camera, developed countries are at the time of hybrid cameras SPECT/CT and PET/CT. Sub-Saharan black Africa in the image of Cote d'Ivoire, a country with limited medical resources shows an important delay in the evolution of the health system in general and particularly in medical imaging equipment. The purpose of this paper was to approach the issues, challenges and sustainable strategy for the implementation of hybrid imaging SPECT/CT in a developing country where the rate of morbidity and mortality remains high due to infectious but also cancer diseases because of the inadequacy of the health technical platform. To address these challenges, Cote d'Ivoire like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa with limited medical resources must design, test and develop clinical strategies adapted to developing countries. Health authorities of this country must develop a policy for sustainable financing of medical imaging, including the training of the adequate health personnel according to a model of corporate leadership. In this perspective, Cote d'Ivoire must have a SPECT/CT instead of a simple gamma camera. This would allow to optimize its diagnostic health system in oncology, bone and joint disease and in many other medical disciplines. And especially since the SPECT/CT is a high-performance device that has largely demonstrated its diagnostic efficiency and that can be used as SPECT alone or as isolated CT. In addition, this country should take over digital imaging in the context of cooperation with some countries of Africa and Europe ahead in the field of modem medical imaging, seeking assistance from international organizations (IAEA, RAD-AID, WHO, ...). Finally this country should implement methods of assessment, types of performance indicators to guide planning for future projects of its system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Using the Economics of Certification to Improve the Safety and Quality
   of Male Circumcision in Developing Countries Three Models of
   Implementation
SO APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY
AB Although male circumcision (MC) has been a widespread practice in some regions, while relatively new in others, it has recently ascended in popularity as a HIV-reduction intervention, particularly in areas with high rates of HIV but low rates of MC. However, the uptake and potential effectiveness of MC may be hampered by uneven levels of provider training and procedure skill within developing country settings. Indeed, this procedure that is otherwise considered simple and safe has witnessed complication rates as high as 25-35% in some areas, leaving some men with irreversible injuries.
   To improve the transparency of procedure quality for prospective patients, I borrow from a classic economics approach and advocate a new application in the form of provider certification. Building on some experience in the healthcare systems and economic rationale of high-income counties, I explore the potential for certifying providers of MC in low-income countries and compare and contrast three models of implementation: government agency, private certifiers and private MC device manufacturers. The hope is that increased transparency of provider quality through any or all three types of certifying programmes can better assist local men as they navigate this otherwise complex and unclear medical care market. As more resources are being devoted to MC scale up, I argue that certification should be considered for incorporation as a means of complementing both current and future efforts in order to enhance the effectiveness of MC campaigns.
   The two models based on privatized certification, as opposed to having the local government underwrite the intervention, may prove most useful when public or philanthropic funding is volatile or incomplete for a given location. The timing for MC campaign adoption and desired speed of scale up may vary across countries in ways that international assistance efforts cannot always immediately and flexibly adapt to. As such, the role of the diverse MC provider marketplace and accompanying quality-revelation mechanisms may take on different levels of importance and expediency across settings as individual countries move forward with their respective HIV prevention campaigns. The subsequent challenge is to creatively design solutions that are sustainable and applicable within diverse host-country environments and expectations. This is where I believe some economic insights are currently lacking in the MC dialogue.
   Although I believe the three certification models exhibit much potential for enhancing medical care delivery in developing countries, they are not without their challenges, and implementation would not necessarily be a simple process. Local levels of medical knowledge, public and private resource constraints and the integrity of local business transactions and government practices would likely influence the nature and success of a certification intervention. However, with sufficient model adaptability and partnerships across public and private sectors, I argue that many of these implementation issues could be proactively addressed. Creative and careful certification structures should ultimately improve the MC circumstances across a variety of developing countries.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Since its conception in early 1990s, cleaner production has helped thousands of businesses around the world in improving environmental performance and reducing risks to their staff. Developing countries, due to their economic, social and cultural limitations are slow to adapt to new ideas. Stresses of WTO and ISO certification are hitting the developing economies hard especially the export businesses. This article re-introduces the concept of cleaner production as a self-help tool as well as an economical pathway towards ISO certification. The objective is to motivate businesses anywhere to join the sustainable development trail. A simple step-by-step procedure to develop a cleaner production program is delineated. Cleaner production opportunities and how their exploration will lead to covering many requirements of the ISO14001:2004 certification is discussed. Cleaner production opportunities in the most common automotive industry are presented along with five case studies from Australia. Special attention is given to energy efficiency. A full section is devoted to equipment-specific cleaner production opportunities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Unbundling of the green bond market in the economic hubs of Africa: Case
   study of Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa
SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Climate change is arguably one of the biggest challenges globally. In order for countries to meet the commitments of the Paris Agreement, climate investments need to be scaled up for adaptation and mitigation strategies. Green bonds are one of the most emerging climate finance mechanisms for large-scale climate projects and offer investment opportunities for many developing countries. Most developing countries are heavily reliant on climate funds which are insufficient. Hence, the urgent need to tap into emerging climate finances such as green bonds. Out of all the regions, Africa is expected to be the worst impacted by climate change and green bonds can contribute to the much needed climate finances. The growth of the green bond market has been observed in the economic hubs of the continent with countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa demonstrating huge potential in being active and contributing to the growth of the market. However, this paper recommends that for the green bond market to further expand in these countries and rest of the continent, there needs to be public-private partnerships fostered, integrated policies, political will as well as effective institutional frameworks.

TI Beekeeping innovation for sustaining rural livelihoods. A success story
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Over the last six decades, international development assistance agencies have tried to introduce innovations in developing countries to stimulate development and improve the quality of life of the poor. The results have been mixed. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of a project introducing modern beekeeping practices to increase household incomes among small farmers in Vietnam. The Project exceeded its targets in terms of the number of farmers who adopted the innovation and the number of households with increased incomes. The farmers also reported development benefits beyond those originally envisioned - improved health, happier family relationships, and greater respect. The successful diffusion is attributed to the readily observable, personally and collectively felt benefits of beekeeping, harmony with the social practice of sharing, and the efforts of the change agent to reduce the complexity of the innovation and to integrate local farmers' knowledge in the training and extension activities.

TI Perspectives on participation in economic policy reform in Africa
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This article examines two questions regarding participation in economic policy reform in Africa: how do the circumstances surrounding participation and the ways it occurs influence the economic policy reform process, and can changes to enhance participation lead to improved policy outcomes? The general findings are, first, that the pattern of participation is an important variable in the policy reform process, but that its effects on reform outcomes are strongly mediated by African political and governance factors. Second, increased participation appears to enhance prospects for sustainable reform outcomes, though the weak capacity and responsiveness of the state and the incipient nature of civil society's associational infrastructure in much of Africa limit opportunities for institutionalizing participation. It is important to be aware of participation's limits as well as its potential contributions to economic policy reform in the context of political liberalization, and to recognize the long-term nature of the transition to new modes of state-society cooperation.

TI Progress towards sustainable urban water management in Ghana
SO SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL
AB Purpose In recent decades, governments in developing countries have experienced relentless pressure from key supranational finance providers (particularly the World Bank) to focus on the achievement of financial efficiency. This pressure persists despite evidence that basic institutions necessary for sustainable infrastructure and competitive commercial arrangements are often not present. This paper aims to examine the steering of urban water management in Ghana as it progressed through a first failed public-private partnership in this sector (from 2005 to 2011), and beyond to 2017. Throughout this 12-year period, the authors consider progress and barriers to the achievement of steering for sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach Publicly available documentation is examined through the lens of steering for sustainable development (Vo beta et al., 2007) to consider the challenges of urban water management between 2005 and 2017. Findings Progress towards a more sustainable approach to urban water management was achieved through greater democratic governance, public accountability and public engagement. This acted as a counter foil to power and affected improvements of knowledge and clarity of related goals. Effective sustainable management continued to be challenged, however, by on-going World Bank pressure to focus on financial efficiency. Practical implications - The provision of a sustainable water supply continues to be a significant challenge for many developing countries, including Ghana. This study provides insights into how progress beyond crippling financial dependency might begin to be achieved. Social implications - Safe and sustainable water supply is critical for both the health and economic progress of citizens in developing countries such as Ghana. This study provides insight into the value of drawing from a broad range of stakeholders in seeking viable pathways towards those goals. Originality/value While water management challenges for developing countries have been significantly researched, particularly in the context of private financing arrangements, little empirical insight is provided into how governments can move forward with sustainable progress beyond the failure of such arrangements. Water management in Ghana beyond 2011 provides that unique context.

TI THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF BUFFER ZONES AND LOCAL-PARTICIPATION IN
   BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
SO AMBIO
AB Recognition is growing that the successful management of protected areas ultimately depends on the cooperation and support of local people. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in financial support for projects attempting to link the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas with local social and economic development. Drawing on our recent analysis of 23 integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs) in 14 developing countries, this paper explores the challenges which have arisen in operationalizing two key concepts which lie at the heart of community-based conservation. First, buffer zones around park boundaries. Second, greater participation of local people in conservation and development. We describe important practical constraints which have so far limited the effective implementation of these two concepts. But-despite some critical constraints operating outside individual projects' sphere of influence-we conclude that innovative, well-designed projects at carefully selected protected area sites that constructively address local people-park relationships will be essential to the conservation of biodiversity, and thus to sustainable development.

AB The development of a cluster is strongly influenced by local social networks, which are usually described by the concept of embeddedness. Once established, a cluster often forms a unique development trajectory through a process of self-reinforcing, and path-dependence occurs not only in technical choices, but also in intra-firm management practices as well as inter-firm relationships and interaction between firm and the supporting institutions.
   Embeddedness is a double-edged sword. Strong embeddedness sometimes hampers the upgrading of development path and results in lock-in. Collective inertia resulting from strategic interdependence, fixed mental model in shared value and norms, and limited information spillovers and cooperation within local bounders, will bound the development on a lower path.
   In response to intense global competition, it is vital for clusters in developing countries to upgrade their development path in order to gain sustainable competitiveness, and how to deal with lock-in is an important issue.

TI Bioenergy life cycle assessment and management in energy generation
SO ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION
AB Bioenergy is an effective energy form used by developing countries. It covers about 38% of the energy consumed primarily obtained from the biomass in about 13% of the world. Due to the energy production costs, much attention has currently been paid on alternative bioenergy sources in the developing countries. Biofuels may be used instead of fossil fuels to produce power, heat, and/or some chemicals. Its production with local resources suggests a reproducible alternative streamlining the economic and social improvement in developing countries, in case the bioenergy projects are established economically viable and well planned with local cooperation. Biofuels are important resources which can take place with fossil-based fuels. Generally speaking, biofuels offer several benefits such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional social and structural development, sustainability in energy provision, and agricultural development. In this study, a life cycle analysis of a full-scale biogas plant was conducted. In the life cycle analysis, the ecological effects of the biogas process, the by-products from the biogas production, and the cogeneration unit where the electricity generation is performed are evaluated quantitatively according to the ISO 14040. The functional unit of the plant was designed for 30tons per day big cattle manure, 5tons per day poultry manure, and 15tons per day cheese whey of industrial biogas plant.

CL Jakarta, INDONESIA
AB As a country with enormous fisheries resources, Indonesia face threats to sustainability of the resources which are suspected because of the implementation of fisheries subsidies that did not consider the resources. On the other side, government provide subsidies to alleviate poverty and improve fishermen's welfare. A number of countries, especially developed countries encourage the elimination of fisheries subsidies through WTO and other countries, especially developing countries opposed the proposal of the developed countries. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make a balance between community development and environmental protection in case of fisheries subsidies. This study reviews the implementation of fisheries subsidies in Indonesia. The research is based on a literacy study along with data and information on fishery subsidies that have been carried out so far by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries as an authorized government agency. The results of the study indicate that there are benefits from providing subsidies to the welfare of fishermen and also support the sustainability of fisheries resources.

TI International Posturing amidst Domestic Neglect: India's Agricultural
   Policy Examined
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB India has actively tried to shape the WTO agricultural negotiations by submitting detailed proposals, building coalitions, and even taking hard stands (veto) at critical junctures. However, this aggressive posturing presents a sharp contrast with India's domestic agricultural space, where the situation highlights policy neglect, manifesting in agrarian distress and farmer suicides. This paper analyzes contradictions between India's internationally espoused negotiating positions and its domestic policy goals. It argues that India's core focus has been to preserve status quo in the domestic food markets, driven by the political need to provide food-based consumption subsidies and manage an assured price and supply protection to its vulnerable consumers. As a result, India's interests are divergent from most of its developing country coalition partners in the G-20 as well as the G-33 groups. Our discussion has significant implications for both the domestic policy, as well as the sustainability of India's strategy in global agricultural trade negotiations.

TI Sustainable organizational capacity building: is organizational learning
   a key?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB This article offers reflections on an unexpected outcome of a study of the distinctive 'twinning' method employed during the last two decades by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to promote sustainable organizational and institutional capacity building in developing countries. Twinning arrangements have produced impressive benefits at the level of professional/technical upgrading, but results at the level of sustainable capacity building have generally been less satisfactory. Consequently, Sida have speculated whether the notion of organizational learning might provide a productive framework for twinning projects.
   The article reports on what appears to be the 'discovery' of an evolving 'learning organization' in apparently unlikely circumstances, and examines the factors which might account for this. The broader implications of the 'discovery' are discussed, and the possible relevance of the notion of tacit knowledge is suggested.

TI International support for feed-in tariffs in developing countries-A
   review and analysis of proposed mechanisms
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Government support in the form of so-called feed-in tariff policies (FITs), which combine long-term, fixed-price electricity purchase agreements and guaranteed grid-access, has attracted large private-sector investments in sustainable electricity generation in the industrialized world. In an effort to replicate these experiences globally, a number of international organizations, NGOs, banks and donor countries are proposing mechanisms to cover part of the cost of FITs in developing countries. This paper reviews these proposals for supported FITs and then uses a case study of Thailand's Alternative Energy Development Plan 2013-2021 to investigate the opportunities and challenges of supporting FITs at a global scale. The review highlights that these proposed mechanisms foresee different roles for national governments and supporting entities, particularly in terms of who is responsible to balance fixed FIT payments with uncertain revenues and savings from carbon markets, donors and avoided fuel consumption. The case study results then show that the uncertainty about the actual cost of supported FITs is so significant that the responsibility to balance the FIT budget has to be considered carefully in the design of any mechanism that is to be employed at scale. To a considerable extent, the uncertainty is driven by the counterfactual analysis, i.e., by assumptions about the future savings from avoided fossil fuel consumption: for example, depending on the fossil fuel price scenario the FIT may result in a cost of USD 17bn or savings of 23bn. Unlike uncertainty about the necessary level of FIT payments, uncertainty about the avoided fossil fuel cost materializes only over the course of the policy's lifetime, making it politically challenging. This suggests that an international support mechanism that differentiates the allocation of responsibility depending on the income-level of the recipient country is more suitable for global-scale support than a one-size-fits-all approach.

TI The 'New Regionalism': Integration as a Commitment Device for Developing
   Countries
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB Increasingly, developing countries embrace foreign direct investment (FDI) and simultaneously pursue economic integration with developed countries. Foreign investment is subject to sovereign risk and free trade agreements may serve as a commitment mechanism in order to achieve higher sustainable levels of FDI. This paper shows that such agreements, by inducing sunk investments in expanding export sectors, can indeed increase the level of self-enforcing FDI. While one might expect FDI from any source to increase, the analysis shows that this need not be true for FDI originating in non-partner countries even though export-platform type FDI will rise. The reason is the offsetting effect from trade diversion, which diminishes the ability to retaliate should a host country renege on its ex ante commitment to a foreign investor. The choice of partner is thus crucial for a country's ability to attract FDI through economic integration.

TI Position paper: Improving governance for effective Veterinary Services
   in developing countries - a priority for donor funding
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB Livestock contributes significantly to the world economy. However, animal diseases and food safety are still major constraints on livestock-sector productivity, economic growth, the reduction of poverty and food security. Efficient and effective governance of Veterinary Services throughout the world is a fundamental requirement for addressing the global animal health and related public health threats. Recent work by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) through the application of the Tool for the Evaluation of Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS Tool) and related Gap Analysis (both of which form part of the PVS Pathway) has indicated that a significant proportion of the national Veterinary Services worldwide do not meet the essential requirements for good governance. This shortcoming poses a significant risk for many developing countries and their trading partners when considered in the context of the growing trade in animal-source foods, and the burgeoning global livestock population. Well-managed, transparent and credible Veterinary Services, in both the public and private sector, are essential for mitigating animal disease risks and ensuring sustainable incomes for vulnerable producers. They are also vital for limiting the public health risks posed by zoonotic diseases. This paper is intended to highlight the impact of governance on the delivery of veterinary services in a development context and the benefits generated by improving veterinary governance. It recognises 'global public good' elements embedded in the good governance of Veterinary Services, and it could also provide an operational development investment roadmap that builds on the OIE PVS Pathway, and innovative financing options based on government commitments supported by donor programmes.

TI Primary Trauma Care: A Training Course for Healthcare Providers in
   Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Outcomes of injury in low and middle income countries may be compromised by skill deficiencies of healthcare providers. Short subspecialty training courses can be a useful solution to skill-deficits. We report on the Primary Trauma Care programme, a 2-day course designed to train frontline health workers in resuscitation and early management of the injured with limited resources and equipment. Developed for use in weak health systems and now conducted in over 70 countries, the programme is cost-efficient with built-in design sustainability by way of early transfer of ownership to local partners to effect a cascade of trauma courses in their communities. Published studies report a significant improvement in both knowledge and skills of the participants with greater confidence in managing trauma victims. A trained health workforce could address the unmet needs identified by Global Surgery and thus contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Benchmarking parties' obligations in the execution of concession-based
   PPP projects in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose - Demand-supply matrices with adverse consequences has occasioned government response to concession initiatives in infrastructure in Nigeria. However, concession-based projects have been trailed by administrative and legal controversies. While this scenario has negatively impacted the acceptability of a concession contract, there is, nevertheless, a paucity of research effort aimed at developing a sustainable framework. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for the evaluation and allocation of obligations of parties, thereby enhancing the synergy and cooperation between the public and private sector organization.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained through a questionnaire administered to professionals in concession-based contracts in southwestern Nigeria, which included architects, estate surveyors, quantity surveyors, engineers and builders, accountants/bankers/economists and lawyers. The respondents were selected using random and respondent driven sampling approaches. The questions were structured to ensure that the respondents have appropriate experience in concession-based projects and hold appropriate positions as decision-makers so as to give credence to the collected data.
   Findings - The study identified 47 contractual obligations in the specific context of developing countries. Based on "half-adjusting principle", 13 of the obligations notably cost of land acquisition and cost of social disturbances were allocated to the public party; 18 of the obligations notably project design and cost of feasibility study were allocated to the private party; and 16 of the obligations including preparation of terms of a contract and relocation of third party facilities were shared by the parties.
   Originality/value - The framework benchmarked the categorization of public and private parties' obligations in concession-based public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. The study has the implication for the evaluation and allocation of obligations of parties, which could mitigate the risk of failure of PPP projects in relation to the specific context of developing countries.

TI Recent History Provides Sustainable African Water Quality Project
   Insight
SO GROUND WATER
AB Small-scale projects to provide clean drinking water undertaken in the developing world can contribute to significantly improving the livelihood of rural communities. There has been a historical tendency to poorly plan such projects leading to an unsustainable future. Recent history indicates three simple steps to ensuring successful and enduring clean water projects. First, identification of need by the indigenous community provides ownership in the project. Second, a partnership between key individuals in the indigenous community with the donor provides for ambassadors on both sides of the project. Finally, an exit strategy by the donors for the indigenous communities ensures local sustainability for the future. The study site is the village of Geisha in northern Malawi, Africa. Sustainable implementation approaches are discussed in this case study as well as the various lessons learned. Improved project processes ensure sustainable small-scale water quality projects by donor organizations in developing countries.

TI Trade effects of voluntary sustainability standards in tropical
   commodity sectors
SO FOOD POLICY
AB This article investigates the trade implications of voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) in tropical commodity sectors. VSS are increasingly important, not only in corporate sustainability strategies, but also in trade policy, thereby shifting the responsibility for the governance of sustainability in the food system from the public to the private sector. There is no regulatory framework assuring that VSS do not distort trade while effectively deliv-ering environmental and social sustainability benefits, and conclusive evidence on the trade effects of VSS is lacking. We compile an innovative database of country-level VSS coverage for five tropical commodities, seven VSS observed for seven years, and use a multi-country,-sector and-standard augmented gravity analysis to estimate the trade effects of VSS adoption. Our results confirm a general trade-enhancing effect of VSS, with on average a one pp increase in VSS coverage resulting in a 1.8 to 3.3% increase in export value. Effects are largest for banana, followed by coffee and tea - and are insignificant for cocoa and palm oil. The trade-enhancing effect of VSS certification does not vary with the income level of the exporter but increases with the income level of the importer and with the income gap between trading partners. Our results imply that VSS can be an effective tool to overcome the trade-inhibiting effect of governance distance between countries. Yet, for VSS to effectively reconcile international food trade with sustainability goals, policy attention is needed to VSS adoption and impact in the poorest countries.

TI The World Trade Organization's Doha Round and Cotton: Continued
   Peripheral Status or a "Historical Breakthrough" for African Farmers?
SO AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiators proclaimed that they had reached a "historical breakthrough" in late Summer 2004 as a framework was created to eliminate all export subsidies and reduce domestic subsidies and tariffs for agricultural commodities. While many hailed this step as a major victory for developing country farmers, others have been cautious on the potential "success" of the agreement. The main objective of this article is to provide an analysis of WTO agriculture negotiations, its main actors and alliances, and its legal content. Given the attention to West African cotton producers during the Doha round, this study focuses on producers of this crop in Mali. More specifically, this article: 1) evaluates progress made within the WTO in the aftermath of the Hong Kong Summit, including the workings of the Sub-Committee for Cotton; 2) analyzes potential short-and long-term effects on African cotton farmers (focusing on economic and ecological sustainability); and 3) proposes an alternative set of policies for improving the situation of African cotton farmers.

TI Understanding grain virtual water flux dynamics and drivers from a
   socio-ecohydrological perspective: A case study of landlocked developing
   countries of Africa
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The virtual water (VW) approach offers a crucial heuristic tool to analyze water and food security by considering the water embedded in grain during the whole production process. African landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continually suffer from an escalating food crisis and water resources and socioeconomic policy and water conservation strategy derived from the water-food nexus of virtual water trade (VWT) systems and re-sources may be the solution. Using a trade gravity model and multilateral data, this study evaluated grain VW flux patterns and 11 main drivers of VWT between 16 African LLDCs and their partners. Besides, the feedback path of VW flows corresponding to the socio-ecohydrological variability was studied using the impulse response function. The findings revealed that net virtual water import (VWI) varied across all 16 African LLDCs, ranging from 1.67 Bm3 to 10.28 Bm3 during 2000 and 2020, with an estimated yearly grain VWI of 105.61 Bm3. Green, blue, and grey water accounted for about 79.3%, 14.7%, and 5.98% of the total grain VWI, respectively. Ethiopia had the highest grain VWI among the African LLDCs. Grain VWI fluxes were significantly and positively driven by population growth and per capita GDP, which were expected to continue in the future. It was concluded that the quantitative analysis of grain VWT patterns and driving forces using the VW theory for LLDCs can be instru-mental for guiding the socioeconomic policy and water conservation strategy. To effectively achieve sustainable water security and grain production, earmarked future VW strategy is required. Decision-makers should incor-porate rational VW strategies and socio-ecohydrological factors into the monitoring system from a multidisci-plinary perspective.

SO REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB Bockground. - In low- and middle-income countries, access to combination antiretroviral therapy for all people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in need of treatment is a major public health challenge. The objective of this paper was to provide an overview of the different financing modalities of HIV/AIDS care at the microeconomic level and an analysis of their advantages and limitations.
   Methods. - A review of the published literature using mainly the Medline and Science Direct databases for the 1990-2008 period M English and French made it possible to explore different financing strategies for the access to combination antiretroviral therapy using as case studies specific countries from different regions: Ivory Coast, Uganda, Senegal, and Rwanda for sub-Saharan Africa. Brazil and Haiti in the Latin America/Caribbean region, and Thailand for Asia.
   Results. - In these settings, direct payment through user fees is the most frequent financing mechanism in place for HIV/AIDS care and treatment, including combination antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, other mechanisms are being implemented to improve access to treatment such as community-based health insurance schemes with free care for the poor and vulnerable households and public private partnerships.
   Conclusion. - The type of financing strategy for HIV/AIDS care and treatment depends on the context. As direct payment through user fees Iimits access to care and does not enable program sustainability. national and donor agencies are introducing alternative strategies such as community financing systems (mutual health organizations, micro insurance, community health funds) and public private partnerships. Finally. access to combination antiretroviral therapy has improved in resource-limited settings; however, there is a need to introduce alternative financial mechanisms to ensure long-term universal and equitable access to treatment and care, including combination antiretroviral therapy.

AB This article discusses the practice of implementing the Sustainability Treaty signed by Bhutan and the Netherlands in 1994. This unique treaty represents a new relationship between developed and developing countries, based upon the principles of reciprocity and equality. The operational aspects of this treaty and the impacts are addressed and analysed in this article. The analysis pays close attention to the implementation process in Bhutan and the Netherlands. The analysis includes a review of the policy documents, interviews and case studies of four projects. The core idea of the agreement was to deviate from the traditional form of cooperation by building a two-way path, promoting equity, reciprocity and participation through dialogue, but it never succeeded in achieving its goal due to differences in political ideology and socio-economic status and lack of shared vision. Yet, the analysis shows that the implementation has been a 'successful failure'. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The issue of securing intellectual property rights in genetic resources has been identified as a key issue for the round of World Trade Organization (WTO) trade negotiations launched in November 2001 by the WTO Doha Ministerial Meeting. The same subject was included in the Food and Agriculture Organization Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, which was opened for signature in November 2001.
   This chapter reviews the five key issues for developing countries in their negotiations on intellectual property rights and access to genetic resources. These are:
   the link between intellectual property protection and development;
   the mandatory obligation in the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to introduce the protection of plant varieties;
   options for the sui generis protection of plant varieties;
   ethical issues relating to the patentability of life-forms; and
   relationship between the conservation and sustainable use of genetic material with the concepts of traditional knowledge and farmers' rights.

TI Cross-sector collaboration and nonprofit boundary work for female
   workers in developing countries: evidence from Bangladesh
SO SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to shed new light on the way the cross-sector collaboration (CSC) process can foster gender-focused sustainability initiatives to improve female workers' conditions in developing countries. The study does so by introducing and examining the influence of nonprofit boundary work during the CSC process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper is based on thirty-four interviews and qualitative fieldwork. It draws on a case analysis of a regional CSC between multiple organizations operating locally in the apparel industry of Bangladesh, a developing country.
   Findings
   Scaffolding work in the CSC formation stage - performed by development agency implementers who construe boundaries - and sensitization work in the CSC implementation stage - performed by a non-governmental organization (NGO) implementers who blur and expand boundaries - emerge as two conceptual categories of nonprofit boundary work. This allows NGO implementers to identify and enable the agency of sustainability envoys or socially privileged individuals who capitalize on their social credentials to support female workers in the factory and in the community.
   Originality/value
   The study offers novel insights into the CSC process. It contributes to the CSC literature and the literature on boundary work, with a focus on gender-focused sustainability initiatives for female workers in developing countries.

AB Entrepreneurship is a critical engine of economy growth and sustainable development. Technological entrepreneurship concerns the ways in which entrepreneurial firms draw on organizational resources and structures to exploit emerging technology and market opportunities. It is very essential for small and middle-sized entrepreneurial firms to pursue continuous technological entrepreneurship so as to build sustainable competitive advantage. This is especially the case for technological entrepreneurship in developing countries, such as Thailand. Based on a case study of I-mobile, this paper explores the important patterns of technological entrepreneurship. These patterns are technology purchasing, strategic partnership, joint venture, and research and development (R&D).

TI The Role of Real Estate in Sustainable Development in Developing
   Countries: The Case of the Kingdom of Bahrain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The construction of real estate has the potential to advance sustainability in terms of meeting economic and social criteria-the Business Case and the Societal Case. This is a crucial aspect in the stated visions and plans in many developing countries. Hence, it is important to understand how real estate can best contribute. Semi-structured interviews with a number of decision-makers involved in the real estate sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain were undertaken to explore perceptions of how the sector could best contribute to sustainable development. The decision-makers came from government bodies, investment banks, real estate developers, investors, constructors, project consultants and auditors. The interviews highlight the importance of having a stated vision and strategy which is highly visible and shared by all stakeholders. In the case of Bahrain this is Vision 2030 and the National Economic Strategy. It is important to ensure that any plans that are put in place to achieve the vision/strategy are adaptable to reflect changes in the external environment. The decision-makers identified three areas of focus in terms of the content of policy in order to meet the economic and social-related sustainability criteria as set out in Vision 2030 and the National Economic Strategy. These are: infrastructure, affordable housing and tourism/leisure. Within these three areas, that of infrastructure is also the key enabler for developments in the other two areas to be realized. In terms of a method of governance, the use of public-private-partnerships (PPPs) was identified as being highly appropriate. Such partnerships are not only useful to leverage private sector investment into specific development projects but also to ensure that such development harnesses innovative and efficient methods.

TI A new approach for anthelmintic discovery for humans
SO TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
AB Natural product-based drug discovery has been deemphasized by the pharmaceutical industry. This situation is discordant with the fact that most people in developing countries rely on traditional medicines derived from local biodiversity for healthcare. Despite economic growth in the past 10 years, Africa remains plagued by parasitic infections, out of reach of eradication. Limited regional funding for drug discovery complicates the situation. Novel models are needed to bring sustainability to local drug discovery programs. This Opinion describes an innovative partnership that promotes local leadership to harness a recombinant yeast-based assay to screen for novel anthelmintic candidates in collections of African natural products. Implementation of this strategy in biodiversity-rich but resource-constrained settings can help build sustainable local capacity for drug discovery.

TI Challenges of biogas implementation in developing countries
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & HEALTH
AB There are immense potential and opportunities for biogas implementation in developing countries, but lack of adequate infrastructures, sufficient capital, and appropriate policy have hindered successful implementation. The previous implementation was supported by governments, international organizations (the United Nations and European Union), and nongovernmental organizations and partly by carbon trading through Voluntary Emission Reductions managed by the World Bank. However, biogas technology in developing countries still require advancement in all levels from small-scale (household or domestic implementation) to large-scale implementation for energy generation, electricity generation, and transportation. There are challenges associated with policy, funding, technical services, sustainability, awareness, and education which are key factors to achieving full potential of biogas in developing countries. These challenges and solutions are briefly discussed in this work. Technical training, enforcement of policy, public-private partnership funding, record keeping, and advertisement of biogas programs are recommended for enhanced biogas implementation.

SO FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: TESTING NEW POLICY APPROACHES
CT 5th Expert Group Meeting on Finance for Sustainable Development
CY DEC 01-04, 1999
CL Nairobi, KENYA
SP Govt Netherlands, Govt Ireland, Govt Kenya
AB The developing world consists of two relatively clearly defined groups of countries: those which are growing at a sustainable rate, albeit with interruptions caused by short-term dislocations (industrializing/developing) and those whose performance is close to stagnation (poor countries). This distinction reinforces the observation of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that "poverty elimination" had become the "poor stepchild" of the annual CSD sessions. The paper addresses an important aspect of the problem: can the inadequacy of official development assistance to nations in need of external finance be remedied by private portfolio and direct investment and, if so, what, are the necessary policy measures for both the investing and recipient nations?
   The policies will hinge on the adequacy of the institutions needed by both the more developed countries and poorer countries if they are both to attract and retain inward flows of private portfolio equity investment and to avoid financial crises.
   The need for external finance derives from the low level of domestic savings and, possibly, the inability to generate export revenues to meet the developmental need for hard currency. Private investments, direct and portfolio, are possible sources of the needed finance. Neither direct nor portfolio investment is likely to be available to the developing countries in the amount needed because of inadequate resource bases and/or an inadequate "institutional infrastructure" and because of inadequate supplies of savings being generated in the consumer-driven economies of the industrialized world. Further, part of the supply of finance potentially available to the developing countries has been siphoned off by the needs of countries with economies in transition.
   There is good reason to consider under-emphasis on poverty as a serious omission if, as seems reasonable, very poor countries will almost inevitably tend to devote any increase in available resources to consumption and to investment which generates consumption goods rather than to the other goals of Sustainable Development ('environmental protection and the creation of biodiversity" and "social programmes'). Failure of the participants in the Rio Summit to officially acknowledge and to repair the inadequacy of financing available to the very poor countries is a major concern.
   In a globalized economic system with a liberalized international economic involvement, developmental strategy requires that nations seeking sustainable development take advantage of the benefits of international trade and investment by following a policy of outward industrialization allowing inflows and outflows of direct investment and utilizing portfolio finance where this is expected to be long-term. This paper addresses two sources of private foreign financing, direct investment and portfolio investment. The paper can be seen as validating Jun and Brewer (1997) in the greater contribution of direct investment to sustainable development, but it also shows the inadequacy of heavy reliance on the corporate sector because these channels of funding together will fail to eliminate the inadequacy of external funding, particularly for poor countries. The paper also examines why this should be so, and what steps must be taken if either direct and/or private portfolio investment are to be relied upon,to eliminate the funding "gap" between the available flow and the amount which could be used efficiently.
   It is necessary to recognize the need for developing countries to have sophisticated institutional infrastructure if they are to rely on private funds for financing sustainable development. In poor countries, such sophistication is probably not feasible because the ability to create the "institutional financial infrastructure" needed to attract private portfolio investment is acquired only as part and parcel of the process of the institutional evolution that is endemic in sustainable development. Middle-income or industrializing/development countries can benefit greatly from inflows of direct, investment and, if they have developed or can develop the appropriate financial infrastructure, from inflows of modern portfolio investment.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the concept and measurements of food security under the framework of The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, explores the link between international trade and food security with an empirical investigation into the case of China, and draw policy implications in the context of WTO.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper elaborates the theoretical interconnection between food security and international trade and then utilize an autoregressive distributed lag model to investigate how/whether trade affects food security in China from two dimensions.
   Findings - The authors find that international trade indeed leads China to increase its dependence on food imports, namely, it negatively affects the food security in China. Owing to the importance of food security under multilateral trade system, this paper then briefly analyzes two relevant topics of Doha Round negotiation, i.e. public stockholding for food security and special safeguard measures. It is proposed that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access.
   Originality/value - This paper discusses the interaction of international trade and food security in various aspects. Empirical study shows that increasing dependence on food imports will negatively impact the food security of China. It is concluded that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access.

TI How natural resources collaboration affects the pollutants level and
   economic growth: Novel evidence from China
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Due to its extensive use of natural resources and industrial activities, China, a rapidly developing country, has faced significant environmental challenges. The study investigates the collaboration of natural resources, pollution levels, and economic growth in China from 2005 to 2021. It offers fresh evidence on how collaboration affects these factors using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) model. The results show that sharing natural resources significantly lowers China's pollutant levels. Pollution has decreased over time as a result of teamwork in environmental management. The study also demonstrates how sustainable collaboration techniques benefit economic development. Collaboration leads to effective environmental management, which improves overall productivity and the state of the economy. The study emphasizes the significance of encouraging and aiding cooperation concerning natural resources to achieve sustainable development objectives. Policymakers can use these findings to emphasize teamwork in resource management to promote a cleaner environment and long-term economic prosperity in China.

TI Innovative ways for solid waste management in Dar-es-Salaam: Toward
   stakeholder partnerships
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Provision of municipal services by local authorities alone cannot be sustained in most cities of the developing countries. Until early 1990s the Dar-es-Salaam City Authority collected less than 5% of the total refuse generated in the city per day. Limited public-sector resources accounted for such low performance. The Sustainable Dar-es-Salaam Project, through environmental planning and management, has been promoting participatory and partnership arrangements whereby working groups formulate strategies and prepare action plans to address critical environmental issues. As an output of the working groups, innovative ways of improving solid waste management in the city have included emergency cleanup campaigns, privatization, community involvement, disposal site management and waste recycling. We have been able to evaluate the performance of these innovative ways through participant observation, document reviews, official interviews, and a survey of householders and businesses. We conclude that these approaches have proved more effective in enhancing solid waste management in Dar-es-Salaam than the conventional approaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Changing North-South and South-South Political Economy of Biofuels
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Since the 2007 food crisis, controversy has engulfed biofuels. Leading up to the crisis, world-wide interest in these fuelswhich include biomass, biogas, bioethanol, and biodieselhad been surging as states increasingly saw these as a way to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets and promote sustainable economic development. Now some consumers, notably in Europe, are scaling back demand as they worry that biofuels are responsible for increased food prices and deforestation. In contrast, some statesparticularly Brazil and the USA, the world's leading bioethanol producerscontinue to promote biofuel development, especially in developing countries. Partnerships arising from these efforts, we argue, reflect new patterns in the international political economy, where trade relationships among developing countries are strengthening, and where economic lines between developed and emerging developing countries are blurring. Given previously observed patterns of resource exploitation involving complex webs of North-South and South-South trade (such as for resources like palm oil in Indonesia), we anticipate that the emerging political economy of biofuels will repeat and reinforce many of these same environmentally destructive trends.

   water resources
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper examines the different mechanisms used by multinational corporations (MNCs) in Nigeria seeking to make long-term social investments by meeting the critical challenge of improving water provision. Community enterprise - an increasingly common form of social enterprise, which pursues charitable objectives through business activities - may be the most effective mechanism for building local capacity in a sustainable and accountable way. Traditionally, social investments by MNCs have involved either donations to a charity, which then assumes responsibility for delivering social outcomes, or direct management of social investment in-house. These approaches have been criticized, however, for their limited contribution to local capacity building, their focus on short-term outcomes, and the restricted role that they afford to communities. Partnering with community enterprise, provided there is sufficient local capacity to support it, is the most effective mode of governance through which MNCs can manage social investments in developing countries.

TI Near-Peer Emergency Medicine for Medical Students in Port-au-Prince,
   Haiti: An Example of Rethinking Global Health Interventions in
   Developing Countries
SO ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB BACKGROUND During a 3-year time frame, a partnership between medical trainees in Haiti and the United States was forged with the objective of implementing an emergency response skills curriculum at a medical school in Port-au-Prince. The effort sought to assess the validity of a near-peer, bidirectional, cross-cultural teaching format as both a global health experience for medical students and as an effective component of improving medical education and emergency response infrastructure in developing countries such as Haiti.
   METHOD Medical students and emergency medicine (EM) residents from a North American medical school designed and taught a module on emergency response skills in PAP and certified medical students in basic cardiac life support (BLS) over 2 consecutive years. Five-point Likert scale self-efficacy (SE) surveys and multiple-choice fund of knowledge (FOK) assessments were distributed pre- and post-module each year and analyzed with paired t tests and longitudinal follow-up of the first cohort. Narrative evaluations from participants were collected to gather feedback for improving the module.
   FINDINGS Challenges included bridging language barriers, maintaining continuity between cohorts, and adapting to unexpected schedule changes. Overall, 115 students were certified in BLS with significant postcurriculum improvements in SE scores (2.75 +/- 0.93 in 2013 and 2.82 +/- 1.06 in 2014; P < 0.001) and FOK scores (22% +/- 15% in 2013 and 41% +/- 16% in 2014; P < 0.001). Of 24 Haitian students surveyed at 1-year follow-up from the 2013 cohort, 7 (29.3%) reported using taught skills in real-life situations since completing the module. The US group was invited to repeat the project for a third year.
   CONCLUSIONS Near-peer, cross-cultural academic exchange is an effective method of medical studentecentered emergency training in Haiti. Limitations such as successfully implementing sustainability measures, addressing cultural differences, and coordinating between groups persist. This scalable, reproducible, and mutually beneficial collaboration between North American and Haitian medical trainees is a valid conduit for building Haiti's emergency response infrastructure and promoting global health.

Pakistan is an energy deficient country with a shortfall within power output of around 6500MW in the form of load shedding. This paper aims to provide an overview of current energy mix, key dimensions, gap between supply and demand and potential of energy sources to meet the future demand in Pakistan. Except for the nonrenewable energy, Pakistan has a renewable energy potential of 2,900,000MW for solar, 346000 MW for wind 3000MW for biogas, 2000 for small hydropower and 1000MW for waste-to-energy, with its share in total present energy scenario being less than 1%. It is suggested to manage existing resources and infrastructures, optimize the energy planning, and enhance the partnership with private sectors and international agencies. Local policy makers and planners should also give priority to the renewable energy to increase its share in the total energy mix and promote the sustainable energy profile of Pakistan.

We describe "Project Ulysses," an integrated service learning program that involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and social entrepreneurs, supporting them in their fight against pressing global problems. We present the findings of a narrative analysis of learning stories produced by Ulysses participants. Understanding how participants make sense of, and learn from, their experiences abroad provides us with insights into how service learning programs can help managers to develop the knowledge, skills, and mind-set that will enable them to successfully support a company's global sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts. We conclude by discussing the implications for leadership development, specifically how organizations can incorporate a responsibility and sustainability focus in their management development programs.

TI Making FDI More Sustainable: Towards an Indicative List of FDI
   Sustainability Characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT & TRADE
AB Reaching the Sustainable Development Goals has become the lodestar of development policymaking. Increased sustainable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to developing countries can contribute to reaching the Goals. This article analyzes 150 instruments (treaties, standards, codes) prepared by key stakeholder groups in the FDI space bearing on the relationship between host countries and foreign investors, to identify FDI sustainability characteristics along the following four dimensions: economic, social and environmental development and governance. These instruments indicate especially the contributions government expect multinational enterprises (MNEs) to make to host countries and those MNEs expect to make to host countries. The analysis yields a set of indicative 'common FDI sustainability characteristics', and 'emerging common FDI sustainability characteristics'. These characteristics can guide various stakeholder groups that seek to increase the contribution of FDI to development; the World Trade Organization's Structured Discussions concerning an investment facilitation framework for development; and to arbitrators seeking to take the development dimension into account when deliberating investor-state disputes.

TI Biotechnology and the bioeconomy Towards inclusive and sustainable
   industrial development
SO NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB To transform developing and least developing countries into industrialised ones, biotechnology could be deployed along the value chain, to provide support to the development of the bio-based industries in such a way to ensure sustainability of the sector and to reduce negative environmental impacts that might otherwise occur. In agribusiness development, for instance, interventions could start from inputs and agricultural mechanization, modern processing technologies, packaging of perishable products, the promotion of food safety in the processing and regulatory environment; and interventions to improve competitiveness and productivity. Worth over USD 300 billion in revenue, the role of the biotechnology goes beyond industrial growth, since it provides opportunities for progress towards many of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper reviews the status of industrial biotechnology as it relates to inclusive and sustainable industrial development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Governance has become one of the most important concepts in developing countries. Consequently, many countries are trying to pursue good governance and adoption according to the established concept of governance in order to achieve the desired sustainable economic growth and development. Yemeni economy has been in deep recession due to Saudi alliance war since March 2015. Once the war stops, restructuring economy required a new development approach with firm and well define good governance principles aiming to achieve Sustainable Development goals.
   Yemen as one of the least developing country, not all of its efforts to move ahead economically have been successful. There is more than one reason for its failure to achieve sustainable economic development, but one is absence of good governance. International organizations, donors, and researchers have prescribed good governance as a solution to persistent development problems. This paper is an attempt to enrich this subject, at least in part, by examining the value of adopting good governance on achieving sustainable development.
   Based on research findings and learning from other countries experience, development progress and challenges, general framework to implement good governance has been recommended to be consider in the future national development agenda to tolerate achieving sustainable development. Building human capacity is one of the key requirements needed to make a qualitative shift towards sustainable development. The current situation of sustainable development and governance in Yemen as a case study has been reviewed in an explanatory methodologies using regional statistics and global database such as UN organizations, World Bank, HDI, SDGs and Governance indicators to examine the progress made over the last decade. Paper recommended practical steps and actions to be taken to help the official government to reform the current institutional arrangements at the regional as well as national levels, such as adopt governance principles, long term planning, and establishing "High Councils for good governance" to ensure integrated policy formulation, adequate cooperation and coordination among different government entities, and between the government and non-state stakeholders. These recommendation and result have been presented to the Yemeni official government and economic institutions aiming to be integrated in the reform strategies, in particular in the Yemen National Development Strategy (2030).
   Based on research findings and learning from other countries experience, development progress and challenges, general framework to implement good governance has been recommended to be consider in the future national development agenda to achieve sustainable development.

TI Cooperation Regimes and Hegemonic Struggle: Opportunities and Challenges
   for Developing Countries
SO POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE
AB There is an increasing convergence in the international relations literature around the idea that changes in the world econ- omy during the last decades are reshaping the international order; although the outcome of such a reconfiguration is yet unclear, many scholars argue that a dispute over global hegemony is already underway. At the same time, drawing on realist and neorealist approaches, international cooperation can be seen as a means to gain legitimacy and tighten alliances. In this framework, this article analyses three cooperation regimes as terrains of dispute to expand-or maintain-international leadership. The first, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda, reflects mainly the attempt to maintain the legit- imacy of the United Nations system and the multilateral institutions that make up the traditional cooperation regime. This framework still responds to Western interests, despite China's efforts to contest and contain US influence. The second, South-South Cooperation, wrapped up in the rhetoric of horizontality and common challenges, is the privileged terrain of middle powers and emerging countries, aiming at increasing regional influence. Finally, the third scheme, International Cooperation for Structural Transformation, is China's new development doctrine and the fulcrum of its struggle to pro- mote itself as a successful new model for global development. In my conclusions I reflect on the opportunities that the co-existence of different regimes offers for developing countries, as well as the challenges that they continue to face in their search for autonomous development paths.

TI The role of CSR in promoting companies' energy-saving actions in two
   Asian cities
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB In Asian developing countries, energy saving has become a crucial issue in sustainable development. However, in countries that possess weak government regulations and market mechanisms, industries are expected to save energy voluntarily. Therefore, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can serve as an important incentive to encourage companies to take voluntary actions.
   In this paper, we analyze CSR recognition and energy-saving actions taken by companies located in two Asian cities. The results of a questionnaire survey revealed that a positive relation exists between CSR recognition and energy saving. In developing countries, CSR develops based on concerns expressed by local cultures and communities. This indicates that the positive relationships that exist between CSR and energy-saving actions reflect the social norms of these communities. The results suggest that policies that encourage companies to enhance their CSR activities in society can serve as effective incentives to encourage energy-saving actions.

TI REMITTANCE AND THE ECONOMY: THE NIGERIAN EXPERIENCE (A REVIEW)
SO SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
   AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Migration is a basic major component of population dynamics which is characterized by deliberate rational decision of the migrant. This phenomenon has been viewed differently by different people, with some mentioning it as a cause of degradation of rural and urban ecological resources. Some associate the spread of HIV/AIDs and recently the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The most positive and powerful outcome of migration is remittance income. The significant contribution of international remittances to the stability and sustainable growth prospects of developing countries cannot be overemphasized. Remittances have not only grown strongly in a positive direction, but these inflows have also exhibited a much more stability than other private capital inflows and Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). Remittances are playing an increasingly large role in the economies of many countries, contributing to economic growth and to the livelihoods of people.

TI REFLECTIONS ON BOTHO AS A RESOURCE FOR A JUST AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY
   TOWARDS AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT PATH IN MODERN HISTORY
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Goulet (1996) declared that a new paradigm of development is clearly in gestation. Such paradigm centers on human development as an end, with economic development as the means (UNDP, 1994). In fact, the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), identify human development as a key to social and economic progress. Indeed, MDGs have become a universal framework for development, and a means for developing countries and their partners to work together in pursuit of a shared future for all. However, from all indications, developing countries, particularly in Africa, are not on target on any of the goals. In order to achieve the MDGs, developing countries are urged to mobilize additional resources and break with business as usual syndrome. Thus the challenge of the MDGs underscores the need for Africa to wake up and exploit the opportunities that 'Botho' can offer in the continent's quest for a 'second independence' (Ake, 2001; Nnoli, 2003) and/or a 'second liberation'(Nnaemeka, 2009) from protracted development crisis of the modern history. Such a need, however, according to Tambulasi and Kayuni (2005) begs the question: Can African feet divorce Western shoes? Of course, there is a wider list of thoughts to be produced on that topic. The paper intends to reflect on 'Botho' as a resource for a just and sustainable economy towards Africa's development path in modern history.

TI A MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING THE REAL EXCHANGE-RATE, WITH
   APPLICATIONS TO THE PHILIPPINES AND TANZANIA
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB A competitive official real exchange rate is important to external balance and sustainable medium-term growth in developing countries. This article presents a methodology for estimating the appropriate real rate and provides a basis for evaluating the extent to which the prevailing rate is misaligned. In particular, the medium-term equilibrium real exchange rate is evaluated by estimating the effects of structural factors on the trend observed for a country's real rate compared with the rates of its major trading partners, taking into account the effects of macroeconomic policy. Structural factors include terms of trade, external capital flows, and trade policy, plus other factors relevant to the circumstances of individual countries. The implied change in the medium-term equilibrium real rate is compared with that of a historical reference period. The application of this methodology to two developing countries, the Philippines and Tanzania, illustrates how it can complement and improve upon other analytic approaches, such as those using purchasing power parity and analysis of parallel rates. This approach is complemented by an analysis of the relation between a country's real exchange rate and those of its major competitors.

TI UNITED NATIONS: REDEFINING GOALS

AB One of the main UN Summit 2015 outcomes is the adoption of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) built on achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to guide the path of sustainable development in the world after 2015. World leaders gathered at the United Nations to take responsibility for the implementation of 17 Sustainable Development Goals - a truly universal and transformative global development agenda. The article compares main common features and distinctions of SDGs and MDGs. It addresses priorities for the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and primary SDG targets. The SDGs are intended to go beyond the MDGs and apply in general terms to all countries, including developed states, emerging economies and developing countries. At the same time, examining the main achievements of MDGs on national and international levels, the authors stress their importance. SDGs provide a framework for every country to create focused and effective implementation strategies and plans within its own domestic context. The article demonstrates the importance for Russian Federation under its UN obligations to elaborate two documents: Sustainable Development Strategy of the Russian Federation and the 2030 SDGs adapted to national priorities. The authors develop main principles of SDGs adaptation to national priorities, conditionally dividing them into two groups: "internal" (combating poverty, education, health, sustainable production and consumption) - Russia has to realize them drawing on its own potential, and "external" (combating climate change, enhancing a global partnership for sustainable development) - Russia can play an important role in the world coordinating with other countries. The article, while demonstrating the importance of climate change issues for Russia after weather and climatic anomalies caused huge social, economic and ecological damages, discusses possible economic tools, such as carbon taxes, introducing the price of carbon, Stock Exchange for carbon trading. The article investigates two large components of global partnership support in international policy of the Russian Federation: financing the assistance to the international development, and forgiveness of considerable debts to developing countries.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Lack of deliberations on the environment regarding its designing, utilization, development as well as effective management of the natural environment has led to its pollution. This leaves a lot to be desired especially in most developing countries which are now embracing environmental sustainability. This paper examines the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana within a case study (The Kumasi City Mall project). Thematic template analysis revealed designer?s own philosophy, request by clients, incentives for green designs, policies and regulation, and competitive advantage as the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. Furthermore, the results disclosed specific governmental role and social network utilization as drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. The outputs of this study offer strategies which are significant to the construction industry in embracing environmental sustainability. Further, the findings contribute to knowledge on achieving the sustainable development agenda.

TI Financing sources and social development: an empirical analysis
SO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse, from an empirical point of view, the importance of each of the main sources of funding in developing countries (foreign direct investment, official development assistance, external debt and remittances) in achieving sustainable, social and inclusive development. Design/methodology/approach The methodology followed to achieve this purpose is the construction of three econometric models. The general model incorporates as a dependent variable the Human Development Index (HDI) and, as explanatory variables, the four sources of funding indicated above, as well as three exogenous variables (human capital, corruption and natural resources). This model is complemented by two extensions that aim to analyse the behaviour of explanatory variables in reducing inequalities and improving each of the HDI components. Findings The results of the estimations of the econometric models show that foreign direct investment and remittances are the sources of funding with the greatest impact on achieving development. Moreover, official development assistance while not making a positive contribution to the achievement of development as a whole, could be adequate to reduce inequalities. Originality/value The added value of this paper consists in carrying out a joint analysis of these four sources of funding because previous researches focussed the attention on some of them, drawing partial conclusions. The conclusion of this study is that the four sources of funding analysed can be considered complementary to promote sustainable and inclusive development, although foreign direct investment has a much more important role.

TI The Wealth of Nations during the Pandemic: The Vaccine Equity
SO KONURALP TIP DERGISI
AB Aggressive global dissemination of the coronavirus indicated the urgency of the development of vaccines at an unprecedented rate and scale. The limited production and short supply of vaccines which were reserved mostly for the advanced economies were the greatest problems of 2021. For emerging economies, this timeline will stretch to late 2022 or early 2023. As a part of systematic immunization programs, the development, licensing, and implementation of the vaccines against the Covid-19 virus started to address health service inequalities among countries. While on one hand vaccination is regarded to be one of the most cost-effective interventions in public health during the pandemic, on the other hand, the introduction and sustainable supply of vaccines needed to be supported and ensured by decision-makers and governments. Due to the weak economic conditions of developing countries, they could not provide enough financial and health support to their citizens during this period. However, since the global GDP loss from not inoculating all countries is higher than the cost of manufacturing and distributing vaccines globally, there has been a growing demand to international cooperation to have global vaccination without omitting any countries.
   This paper focuses on the economic and social costs and benefits of vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic period in advanced, middle, and low-income countries. Accordingly, macroeconomic and social impacts of vaccination will be discussed and some policy suggestions will be put forth to get more benefits from the vaccination both for economic and health outcomes.

TI Capacity building in regional space cooperation: Asia-pacific space
   cooperation organization
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB The increasing gap in the space capabilities of different countries has led to the need for capacity building in modern times. Space capacity building of countries without or with limited space capacity via international cooperation with advanced spacefaring nations is a good practice towards intragenerational equity among all spacefaring countries, and between spacefaring and non-spacefaring countries at the same period of time. A case study is used here to show the current situation of the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO) and its member states that are associated with their space capacity building. The study finds that neither the satellite technology development model developed by Wood and Weigel (2011) nor the model developed by Ercan and Kale (2017) is a good fit for the development of space capability in all of the developing countries. Therefore, using the APSCO member states as a case study may offer guidelines towards the space capacity building of other developing countries. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the merits and flaws of APSCO's capacity building programs through comparing them with similar projects carried out by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Asia-Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum (APRSAF) and some other countries is conducive to providing some references for regional cooperation in the field of space capacity building. While international space law and the APSCO Convention can provide the general principles for capacity building activities under the framework of APSCO, they are only relevant to the development of scientific and technological capacities for space and human resources rather than organizational development and legal frameworks. Some international soft laws can likewise provide guidance for the capacity building activities of APSCO and its member states in the areas of international direct television broadcasting, remote sensing and cooperative way. To enhance its and its member states' space capabilities, APSCO, in the context of space commercialization and maintaining the long-term sustainability of outer space activities (LTSOSA), should establish a comprehensive internal regime that addresses scientific and technological capacity building for space, human resources, organizational development and legal frameworks, a flexible regime for international cooperation with other developed spacefaring nations and international organizations with relevant technical capabilities and an internal research center for space law, and actively expand its membership by embracing other economically or technologically developed spacefaring nations in the Asia-Pacific region.

AB This paper examines the role of development discourse in Nepal's tourism policy. In Nepal, tourism is an important part of development activity that is driven by international development partners. Since the ideology that drives the international agencies has undergone a huge transformation in the last 25 years, it would be useful to see how such changes are reflected in the tourism public policy of Nepal. Data include analysis of two tourism policies, other documentary sources and interviews with eminent tourism experts to compare the two tourism policies when international development 'thinking' was different. The findings show that seemingly 'tourism' policies are the outcome of domestic political contexts that they are not outwith the scope of international development ideology advanced by development partners. The paper makes a useful contribution to understanding the role of international development ideology in the tourism policy-making of a developing country.

However, the presence of challenges makes SETs implementation difficult, and hence to increase the effective adoption of SETs, potential strategies are essential to overcome challenges. The objective of this study is to identify and rank major strategies of SETs adoption in the construction sector to overcome its barriers. This study proposes an integrated framework based on two methodologies, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to an ideal solution (F-TOPSIS), to prioritize major strategies to overcome SETs adoption barriers. Initially, obstacles and strategies are identified from a comprehensive literature review. Later, FAHP is utilized to obtain weights of various SETs barriers through pairwise comparison, and strategies are ranked by using F-TOPSIS. The proposed methodology is empirically applied to the construction sector of developing countries. The integrated framework provides a detailed and effective decision-making tool for uptake and adoption of SETs. Lastly, the robustness of the methodology is evaluated with the support of sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that government and economic barriers are the most critical barriers which can be overcome through cooperation of relevant authorities, financial assistance, and developing appropriate policies.

AB Introduction: Efficient use of health care resources in low-income countries by providers and local and national managers requires timely access to patient data. Objective: To implement electronic health records (EHRs) in HIV clinics in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Results: We initially developed and implemented an EHR in Kenya through a mature academic partnership. The EHR was then implemented in six HIV clinics in Tanzania and Uganda in collaboration with their National AIDS Control Programmes. All implementations were successful, but the system's use and sustainability varied depending on who controlled clinic funding. Conclusions: Successful EHR use and sustainability were enhanced by local control of funds, academic partnerships (mainly by leveraging research funds), and in-country technology support.

TI Evaluation of organizational procurement performance for public
   construction projects: systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Construction is an essential contributor for both developed and developing economies. Corruption, schedule delays, cost overruns, and erratic project performance are common few problems that face the conventional procurement process of any organization. This research focused on the weakness of current procurement practices in public construction projects in Iraq, as stated by the World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports. The methodology of this study was to collect data by conducting a thorough systematic search of existing literature. The authors used QDA Miner 4 software for coding and thematic categorization. The study found 42 variables from previous studies, and the authors distributed these variables into 12 thematic divisions representing the organization's key performance indicators (KPIs). The authors conclude that these indicators are important to introduce many frameworks for the integration of procurement process in developing countries. For future studies, there is a possibility to introduce an integrated construction and design framework to enhance organizational performance and the procurement process.

SO HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY
AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals include an explicit commitment to "substantially expand" the studyabroad scholarships available to developing countries (Target 4b). Although this Target indicates a level of consensus about the benefits of scholarship programmes, it is made ambiguous by assuming coherence among many types of scholarship programme with different aims, approaches, and undergirding theories. In this paper, we examine the potential consequences of underpinning Target 4b through three theories: human capital, human rights, and human capabilities. Through the lenses of these three theories, we find significantly different outcomes projected for the ways that scholarship programs are linked to sustainable development. Additionally, failing to comprehend the theoretical frames that undergird scholarship programs creates an opportunity for diverse (and sometimes perverse) outcomes that may not serve the world's compact for a sustainable future. We propose a way forward through a human capabilities approach.

SO CLIMATE POLICY
CT Low-Carbon Meeting held at the Annual Energy Modelling Conference
CY DEC, 2006
CL Oxford, ENGLAND
AB Under the Japan-UK research project 'Low-Carbon Society (LCS) Scenarios Towards 2050', an international modelling comparison was undertaken by nine national teams, with a strong developing-country focus. Core model runs were a Base case, a Carbon price case (rising to $100/tCO(2) by 2050) and a Carbon-plus case to investigate an LCS scenario with a 50% reduction in global CO2 emissions by 2050. The comparison emphasis was to focus on individual model strengths (notably technological change, international emissions trading, non-price (sustainable development) mechanisms and behavioural change) rather than a common integrated assumption set. A complex picture of long-term LCS scenarios comes from the range of model types and geographical scale (global vs. national); however, common themes for policy makers do emerge. A core finding is that LCS scenarios are technologically feasible. However, preferred pathways require clear and early target setting and incorporation of emissions targets across all economic activities. This will probably entail significant socio-economic changes. To realize major LCS transitions requires sustained progress in R&D and deployment of a broad range of technologies, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) a key technology in most low-carbon portfolios. Developing countries, in particular, face an immense challenge to achieve LCS in light of their economic growth requirements. As such, international cooperation is required in iterative and flexible burden sharing under international emissions trading regimes.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Slums are faced with several challenges including lack of sanitation facilities. This lack is further compounded by the difficulty in determining an appropriate sanitation technology due to the challenging living conditions. An appropriate technology should, among others, consider the conditions of each settlement as well as views of the slum residents. Through interviews and participatory discussions, residents of the slums in Kisumu city identified sanitation technologies they preferred, and the reasons for or against these technologies. These responses were pointers to characteristics of an appropriate technology for the slums. Pit latrines, ecological sanitation and flush toilets were identified, but residents selected pit latrines as appropriate for their settlements. The results mean that technically, an ideal technology should be easy to construct and use, be socioculturally acceptable, environmentally friendly and economically affordable. This article calls for cooperation among stakeholders, including landlords and tenants in decision-making for sanitation in slums.

AB Besides some ecological constrains, expanding World economy in recent years promoted dynamically growing demand for nearly all groups of mineral raw materials. This situation was observed and positively concluded by the European Union in the years 2005-2007. Several documents and new law regulations has been accepted by EU Committees. It has changed EU mineral policy, especially regarding mineral raw materials supply for EU economy. The new major directions in this policy are: growing supply front European countries (both EU and non-EU countries) and cooperation with third developing countries (mostly African ones). This includes EU contribution to development of their mining industry, as well as direct investments of EU companies e.g. in Africa. In Poland, there is an expectation for appropriate legislation that will follow trends already accepted by EU. Up till now, they have already found several practical implementations in Polish economy. The authors propose the main directions of Polish mineral policy, for two time horizons: up to 2015 and up to 2030, with necessary changes in actual legislation.

TI Access to water in developing countries: four options for provision and
   regulation in the water sector
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB Water plays a central role in the life of society. However, factors such as population growth, pollution and poor allotment and distribution mechanisms place severe pressures on adequate and equitable water supply. The principle of universal and consistent access to clean water is a key part of the Millennium Development Goals and a major component of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Provision of water has to be efficient, sustainable, accessible and affordable for all - especially in developing countries. The water issue arises from the capacity of governments to expand water networks and maintain or improve infrastructure in order to supply water to their citizens and particularly to their most marginalised populations. In response, the discussion here contributes to the debate about whether and how water should and can be provided by governments only or with private and social sector participation. Four options are addressed, with a significant conclusion being that private sector participation in water provision necessitates rigorous public regulation to enforce standards and ensure adequate and affordable access to water resources.

We find no evidence to suggest that a forest convention will be effective in halting deforestation. Our data indicate that development assistance may he the most effective approach to save forests in developing countries. It appears that "money speaks louder than words." We conclude that a global forest convention will be ineffective unless accompanied by substantial and well-directed development assistance.

TI Asset-Backed Securitization of PPP Projects: The Case of China
SO CHINESE ECONOMY
AB Sustainable and robust infrastructure plays a critical role in a country's economic growth and improving living standards. Public private partnership (PPP) is an efficient tool for financing infrastructure. PPP has gained attention globally as a way to access capital markets and enhance the implementation of infrastructure by boosting private sector participation. The higher efficiency and innovative technology that the private sector brings can fundamentally improve the performance of PPP infrastructure projects from an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) perspective. This paper extends the existing literature on China's experience in developing asset-backed securitization (ABS) of PPP projects. It aims to understand how ABS would encourage PPP investments through greater private sector involvement in infrastructure projects in developing countries. Conducting a qualitative case study in China, the paper elaborates on how ABS can facilitate the implementation of PPP for infrastructure in order to achieve sustainable economic development in China. It also analyzes the existing challenges in the implementation of PPP asset-backed securitization (PPP-ABS) and provides policy recommendations.

TI Toll Rate Policies of India: A Review, Comparison, and Inferences
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB Tolling as a method of financing transportation systems is becoming increasingly common worldwide. The collection of fees from road users under public-private partnership agreements is based on prescribed toll fees/rates. According to the prevailing level of human, traffic, environmental and economic development, these toll rate policies vary from country to country. In India, road toll rates are prescribed by the Gazette of India: Extraordinary (Part II Section 3 sub-section ) published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956. Each year, the toll rates for each toll facility in India are set as per the National Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008. There is now a need to revisit the policies on fixing toll rates in India. The present study presents a critical literature review of the toll rate policies in India and other developed and developing countries. The study provides a comparison of the different vehicle classes considered for toll rates and it is found that most of the classifications are based on gross vehicle weight (GVW) and on number of wheels and axles. Additionally, the toll rates for different nations are compared and it is found that Indian toll rates are lower than those of the developed countries. Finally, the research gaps are given for further research.

AB Problems associated with water can be broadly grouped as a) inadequate availability of water, b) poor quality of water for the intended use and c) indiscriminate use of this valuable natural resource. The technological approaches for solving the problems may therefore emanate from a) Winning water from sustainable resources, b) Augmentation of quality of water from available and accessible sources and c) Renovation for recycle. A Technology Mission on Winning, Augmentation and Renovation (WAR) for water was mounted in 2009-10 to address the water challenges adopting three pronged technological approaches stated above by Union Ministry of Science and Technology. The mission shaped several research-led solutions through national and coordinated approach.
   The Technology mission WAR for Water was developed on the principle that timely, urgent, cost effective, socially viable and holistic sustainable techno-management solutions are required for solving problems of water. The mission emphasized problem solving approach and focused on applications research in view of urgency of the solutions required. The major challenges facing the country as well as the representative hotspots for addressing these challenges were identified to mount research based solutions. Roping in solution providers and stakeholders to address water challenges through meeting technical and economic benchmarks with well defined revenue model for technology based and community management solutions was a novel experiment taken up under the mission. Pilot trials and performance evaluation of 25 convergent solutions covering 19 water issues for addressing water challenges in 14 provinces has been implemented.
   The initiative also promoted developmental research for designing and developing low cost solutions for domestic use of safe drinking water, referencing of technologies to social context, capacity building of water managers and encouraging new research ideas. Bilateral and multilateral Innovation Cooperation was developed to promote Joint R&D as well as deployment of innovative solutions for treatment of drinking water, waste water treatment and contaminant detection. Capacity building programme for sustainable rainwater harvesting and ground water recharge programmes which included rooftop rainwater harvesting, rainwater harvesting in paved and unpaved areas and rainwater harvesting in lakes and tanks evinced interest not only from Indian provinces (states) but also from several developing countries and training programmes were conceptualized and implemented for participants from 15 developing countries.

TI Building Watershed Management Capacity in Nigeria: Expanding the Role of
   Agriculture Colleges
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION
AB Developing countries face many critical social, agricultural, and natural resource-related issues where watershed management plays a prominent role. Short-term gains in productivity often occur at the expense of long term system resiliency needed to achieve sustainability. Post-secondary (tertiary) education institutions are underfunded and hampered by bureaucratic inertia limiting their relevance toward addressing emerging water resources concerns. As populations urbanize, rural constituencies continue to lose influence. Using the case of Samaru College of Agriculture, part of Ahmadu Bello University in north-central Nigeria, this paper identifies institutional challenges and suggests solutions to help similar institutions better address watershed management issues. Given current constraints, a watershed management curriculum could be built upon existing courses offered in related majors. Developing partnerships with an expanding private sector could help create opportunities for meaningful solutions to management issues and foster problem solving skills among students. Outside investment in increasing university capacity to address watershed education, including hiring staff focused on these issues, is justifiable given the humanitarian and security crises that have been afflicting northern Nigeria's vulnerable agricultural landscape.

AB Despite significant efforts in the improved cooking sector over the past several decades, challenges have been encountered in developing high-performance products that both satisfy user preferences and are affordable. Among the reasons for these challenges are poor dissemination of R&D results to cooking technology enterprises, underutilization of the existing knowledge base by organizations working on the design of cooking technology, and lack of resources within enterprises to devote to product line improvement. This paper presents experiences from a pilot program, the Harvest Fuel Initiative, which partnered local clean cooking enterprises with technical, business and user-research expertise to evaluate and improve their product lines, achieve growth and economic sustainability, and understand the needs of their user markets. Specific examples include lab- and field-based product testing, implementation of quality control measures, and user-centered research studies. While these efforts directly benefited the partner enterprises, the innovation and lessons learned are of benefit to a wide range stakeholders working in technology for developing countries.

CY 2005
CL Biloxi, MS
AB There is a growing need for international cooperation among developing countries in order to increase the contribution of artificial reefs to reverse the trend of fisheries resource depletion. To establish desirable directions for future cooperation in this field, we analyzed three recent artificial reef projects in the Philippines and Senegal. Past experience has begun to teach us that artificial reef deployment alone does not produce clear, positive effects in enhancing fisheries resources, but rather leads to the opposite effect of attracting fishing activities in protected areas. As poverty among fishermen lies behind this problem, it is imperative to include economic activities, such as commercialization of highly valued fish in artificial reef projects. Income from such activities can be used to compensate for the decline of income due to reduction of catch and to raise funds for sustainable surveillance of undesirable fishing practices on the artificial reefs. Furthermore, artificial reef projects must be integrated in a broader fisheries management plan in order to be effective. Unless the positive impacts of artificial reefs are clearly established, they should not be overestimated. While a participator), approach is desirable for an artificial reef project, the ideal outcome should be co-management by fishing communities and the government.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore the most interesting and controversial mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM, which, taking charge of the conflict between efficiency and equity and fairness, gives the Parties the opportunity to meet their quantified targets in the most economically efficient way and to contribute to the cause of sustainable development in developing countries.
   The actions directed toward both goals are analyzed, considering in particular the technologies which have been employed and where, the possible benefits and obstacles; all the information has been taken from articles recently published in specialized journals, data provided by the UNFCCC and the Institute Riso. It is evident the indisputable value of the more efficient projects in mitigation, but the main results indicate the need of promoting specialized education in host countries and strengthening the mechanism to ensure sustainable development oriented projects.

TI Virtue or vice? Solar micro-grids and the dualistic nature of low-carbon
   energy transitions in rural Ghana
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Low-carbon energy transitions scholarship has witnessed an exponential rise since the beginning of the millennium. Many studies have explored the different pathways to achieving global carbon neutrality in the next few decades. Greater efforts have been focused on how poorer regions could be supported to achieve universal access to clean and affordable energy by 2030. However, little research has investigated the dualistic nature of lowcarbon energy transitions vis-a-vis inherent contextual factors which could promote or hamper full realization of a broad array of benefits associated with sustainable energy projects in developing countries. Drawing upon interviews of experts and key informants, focus group discussion involving different groups of rural people in Ghana, alongside direct observation, we investigated the virtues and vices of solar micro-grid deployment in Ghanaian rural islands. Results of case studies from three rural islands show gradations of valuable outcomes from gender equity and social transformation to undesirable impacts of dispossession and conflicts. While the solar micro-grids engendered streams of benefits for the local people, the projects also exacerbated existing contextual issues and triggered novel challenges. These results may guide policy makers, practitioners, researchers, donors, and development partners to pay attention to these subtle issues in their efforts to promote low-carbon energy technologies in the developing countries.

TI Circular economy and six approaches to improve potassium life cycle for
   global crop production
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 calls for a transformative action to eradicate hunger and poverty and is particularly important for food production in developing countries (see SDG 1 Zero Hunger). Farmers in developing countries apply less potassium fertiliser than those in developed countries due to the high cost of imports and unavailability of domestic supplies. A circular economy approach can improve the efficient use of potassium resources throughout their life cycle from "mine to mouth" by identifying problem areas and assisting in designing supply strategies that help address the needs of farmers. As a nutrient, potassium conventionally follows a linear life cycle from mining. Using secondary data sources and literature, we analyse global demand and supply of potassium to quantify and illustrate the major supply shortages in the Global South.
   This study identifies six options to improve potassium availability: (1) expanding conventional potassium mining and distribution systems serves those who can afford globally-traded fertiliser products; (2) seeking alternative sources of potassium, such as remineralisers, that provide a local source that is accessible to poorer farmers, and in many cases helps the circular economy of local mining operations that focus on other products; (3) improving markets by supporting trade and mitigating some of the disadvantages encountered in developing countries, such as transport and small scale of purchasing; (4) increasing the use of organic fertilisers, such as sewage and manures; (5) reusing crop residues and other farm wastes as sources of potassium, regarding a farm unit as a closed system as far as is practicable; and (6) recycling food waste so that nutrients return to the land, rather than to discard. Existing restrictions and practices mean that there is no single solution to enhance food production in the Global South using the circular economy principles. However, if these circular economy principles and policies are considered at farm to country scale progress can be made.

TI Smallholder dairy production systems in developing countries:
   Characteristics, potential and opportunities for improvement - Review
SO ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Smallholder dairy production systems in developing countries are discussed with reference to type of systems, their characteristics, potential, and opportunities for improvement. Three types of dairy systems are identified and described: smallholder systems, smallholder cooperative dairy production systems, and intensive dairy production systems. The first two systems are by far the most important, and are associated with increasing intensification. Buffaloes are especially important in South Asia, but elsewhere dairy production mainly involves Holstein-Friesian cross-bred cattle. Dairy goats are important in some countries, but are generally neglected in development programmes. The expansion and intensification of smallholder dairy production is fueled by increased demand for milk with associated problems of milk handling and distribution, hygiene and environmental pollution. The major constraints to production are inter alia, choice of species, breeds and availability of animals; feed resources and improved feeding systems; improved breeding, reproduction, and animal health care; management of animal manure, and organised marketing, and market outlets. These constraints provide major opportunities and challenges for research and development to increase dairy production, efficient management of natural resources, and improved livelihoods of poor farmers. Specific areas for research are identified, as also the need of a holistic focus involving interdisciplinary research and integrated natural resource management, in a shared partnership between farmers and scientists that can demonstrate increased productivity and sustainable production systems. Suggestions for performance indicators in smallholder dairy production systems are indicated.

TI A Hybrid Mechanism of Multilateral Economic Cooperation as a New Form of
   Foreign Policy of China
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB The authors analyze current trends in multilateral international cooperation determined by the global stagnation and the changing role of developing countries that reflects their growing political and economic potential compared to developed countries.
   China is one of the leading actors in the process of modernization of the multilateral cooperation. The authors examine the scale and potential influence of two China-led multilateral cooperation and development initiatives in Eurasia: the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). These initiatives imply a new kind of initiator different from the traditional participant in international multilateral initiatives. China's growing global role has reached a qualitatively new stage related to the fact that the country has moved into first place among world economies and has accumulated significant financial resources, although per capita income remains relatively low. Furthermore, China's internationalization model has required it to be more actively involved in the global governance system as a responsible superpower. The awareness to address important issues of economic growth, sustainable development and the provision of global public goods forces China to go beyond the standard profit-seeking trade and investment models of internationalization. The explication of its enormous economic potential at the regional (African, Asian and Latin American) and global levels directly or indirectly contradicts the interests of the leading developed and developing countries concerning foreign markets, mineral resources access and political influence in Eurasia. The authors offer an objective assessment of the potential impact of the Silk Road Economic Belt and AIIB on the associated national economies. The Silk Road Economic Belt is an integral part of the "One Belt and One Road" project and involves the construction of transport and logistics infrastructure from East to West across the Eurasian continent. It will be implemented through traditional Chinese economic diplomacy using preferential or free trade agreements with participating countries and funding conditional on the procurement of Chinese infrastructure goods or access to raw materials in the borrowing countries. The AIIB is a regional bank for reconstruction and development promoted by China together with European countries in support of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Based on an analysis of expert opinions and official statements as well as the system of banks for reconstruction and development in Eurasia, the authors conclude that China is making exceptional organizational and financial efforts for its economic expansion into the Eurasian continent using a hybrid model of cooperation and development.

AB A high potential growth for renewable energy technologies is available in Mexico. However, oil consumption has hindered the transition to a green economy. This paper analyses the Mexican stage and the factors influencing the renewable energy market using PESTL technique. A research framework to market renewable energy in Mexico is proposed. Such framework involve the analysis of incentives to energy, the dissemination knowledge among market participants, the fostering of government-private-NGO partnering in projects deployment, the development of organizational capabilities, and the promotion of feasible technologies. This paper concludes that only the use of sustainable energy will allow the country to achieve the economic, social and environmental benefits of sustainable development. The resulting framework from this study will offer new insights to corporate strategists and policy makers and help them increase the share of renewable energies.

AB Investment in disease control should be targeted to critical points that provide the greatest benefit to the livelihoods of livestock-dependent stakeholders. Risk-based targeting should balance the impacts of diseases against the feasibility of their control This requires sensitive and specific surveillance systems that provide representative overviews of the animal health situation for accurate assessment of disease impact and transmission patterns. Assessment of impact should include household and market effects The key in surveillance is involving livestock owners using active methods that ensure their disease priorities are addressed Epidemiological targeting of interventions to critical points in disease transmission cycles should be done to obtain maximal disease reduction Interventions should be delivered in full partnership with both private and community-based stakeholders to assure high uptake and sustainability.

TI A global strategy to mitigate the environmental impact of China's
   ruminant consumption boom
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Rising demand for ruminant meat and dairy products in developing countries is expected to double anthropogenic greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from livestock by 2050. Mitigation strategies are urgently needed to meet demand while minimizing environmental impacts. Here, we develop scenarios for mitigating emissions under local vs global supply policies using data from 308 livestock farms across mainland China, where emissions intensities are -50% higher than those in developed nations. Intensification of domestic production and globalized expansion through increased trade result in reductions in global emissions by nearly 30% over a business-as-usual scenario, but at the expense of trading partners absorbing the associated negative externalities of environmental degradation. Only adoption of a mixed strategy combining global best-practice in sustainable intensification of domestic production, with increased green-source trading as a short-term coping strategy, can meet 2050 demand while minimizing the local and global environmental footprint of China's ruminant consumption boom.

AB Open innovation, which refers to combining internal and external ideas and internal and external paths to market in order to achieve advances in processes or technologies, is an attractive paradigm for structuring collaborations between developed and developing country entities and people. Such open innovation collaborations can be designed to foster true co-creation among partners in rich and poor settings, thereby breaking down hierarchies and creating greater impact and value for each partner. Using an example from Concern Worldwide's Innovations for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health initiative, this commentary describes an early-stage pilot project built around open innovation in a low resource setting, which puts communities at the center of a process involving a wide range of partners and expertise, and considers how it could be adapted and make more impactful and sustainable by extending the collaboration to include developed country partners.

AB The report explores the extractive sector in Ghana. It looks at corporate engagement with stakeholders, particularly with the communities and Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Using evidence from the literature as well as publications from the mining companies and government statements, it asserts that corporate actors need to adopt sustainable CSR strategies that go beyond philanthropy and entail sustainable practices appropriate to a developing country context. Such an approach, it proposes, needs to be carried out in partnership with other stakeholders in order to be more beneficial. It notes that although, there are encouraging signs now of a more responsive private sector with some companies undertaking socially acceptable initiatives, the turn-around has come through a period of major differences and conflict with local communities, whose agitations for a more responsive form of mining had earlier been ignored.

TI Let there be light: A multi-actor approach to alleviating energy poverty
   in Asia
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Energy poverty is the primary energy security issue impacting almost 800 million people, particularly women and children, in the developing countries of Asia. Current trends indicate that should there be no change to existing policies, and the governance systems and institutions underpinning them, the absolute number of energy poor will barely shift. Most significantly, addressing energy poverty is critical to absolute poverty reduction, enhanced gender equality and political stability in the Asian region. We offer a solution to progress the energy poverty alleviation effort focused on encouraging sustainable, development-centred investment. This will involve multi-actor partnerships between developed and developing country governments, investors, and multilateral institutions. We propose that there may be spill over effects for investing firms, in the form of strengthened corporate reputation. Consequently, energy poverty alleviation efforts can create new opportunities for commerce, multilateral institutions, NGOs, and developing and developed countries. It is envisaged that the multi-actor approach put forward by this paper will facilitate the partnerships, programs and provisions needed to alleviate energy poverty in Asia. However, critical to the success of this collaborative approach is a genuine shift in sentiment from the key stakeholders involved in the effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

GMP compliance is also a challenge, as sometimes innovation and clinical development focus is not accompanied by command of scale-up and quality assurance for large volume manufacturing and supply. Identifying and addressing such challenges, beyond cost and cold-chain space, including safety considerations and health worker behavior, regulatory alliances and harmonization to foster access to vaccines, will help countries to ensure sustainable immunization. There needs to be continuous and close management of the global vaccine supply both at national and international levels, requiring careful risk management, coordination and cooperation with manufacturers. Successful partnership models based on sharing a common goal, mutual respect and good communication were discussed among stakeholders.

These initiatives have been supported by civil society organizations and international agencies. Local communities have also assumed custodianship of their environment and natural resources which previously was the sole responsibility of the government. This chapter focuses on some of India's efforts to communicate the green path to sustainable development and the experiences of India-EU partnerships to build mutual understanding on global environmental issues including climate change.

AB Over the past three decades, there have been many comprehensive studies related to public-private partnerships (PPP), but the analysis at the macro level still lacks comprehensiveness and interpretability. Through the application of bibliometric analysis, 2-mode network, and strategic coordinate analysis, we systematically analyzed the derivative characteristics of the literature data and the coupling characteristics of countries and keywords. Moreover, through the frequency and betweenness centrality, etc., this paper determines the evolution path of keywords and the evolution direction of theme words and realizes the prediction of theme words and keywords in the future. The results show that: (1) Through the three-stage biclustering analysis, we determined the hot theme words and hot keywords for each stage and focused the theme direction and main research content of the evolution, which led to great interpretability of the data analysis in the literature characteristics; (2) Through the distribution characteristics of time and space, the USA, China, the UK and other mainstream publishing countries and their main research hotspots were determined. Among them, developing countries have strong willingness in academic cooperation and great potential for academic development; (3) According to the derivative characteristics of the literature data, it is predicted that the future research hotspots are: the integration of business economy and sustainability, the integration of policy support and innovative technology application, and the urbanization promotion of developing countries. Based on the findings, this study makes concrete and targeted research methods and provides reference value and application value for the future research and analysis of PPP.

TI Japan's economic slowdown and its global implications: a review of the
   economic modelling
SO ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB Despite its role as a driver of global economic growth through the 1970s, in recent decades the rise of China has seen the international importance of Japan's economic performance recede from the public discourse. This is notwithstanding its continuing key role as economic partner to both industrial and developing countries and changes in its economic performance that would otherwise be a matter for global concern. In particular, the tendency for the Japanese economy and its external trade to stagnate not only has immediate consequences for global performance but also foreshadows a path to industrial transition for other key Asian economies. This paper reviews quantitative studies of Japan's performance. It identifies a paucity of results addressing global implications and suggests new research in this direction.

TI Early initiation of and exclusive breastfeeding in large-scale
   community-based programmes in Bolivia and Madagascar
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION
AB About one-fourth to one-half of all infant deaths in developing countries occur in the first week of life. Immediate breastfeeding within the first hour, followed by early exclusive breastfeeding, improves the health and survival status of newborns. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that breastfeeding practices, crucial to infant health, can be improved at scale in developing countries. During 19992003, the LINKAGES Project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development, implemented its community-based model to bring about rapid change in individual. behaviours and community norms regarding early and exclusive breastfeeding, at a scale [LINKAGES' definition of 'scale' was adapted from a CORE Group background paper on 'Scaling-up' maternal, newborn, and child health services, 11 July 2005] that could achieve significant public-health impact. 'Scale' was defined as bringing improved infant-feeding practices to more people over a wider geographic area, more quickly, more equitably, and with sustainability as a goal. During this time, country-specific programmes were designed and implemented in Bolivia and Madagascar, with catchment populations of one million and six million respectively. These country programmes were implemented with multiple local government, private voluntary organizations, and partners of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) through existing health and nutrition activities. Breastfeeding was an entry point to work at all levels of the healthcare system and, within communities, using policy/advocacy and training for healthcare workers, with a particular emphasis on front-line health workers and community members. Harmonized messages and materials, including mass media, were developed and used by partners. Timely initiation of breastfeeding was one indicator measured. Data collected through rapid assessment surveys showed statistically significant increases (p < 0.001) in timely initiation of breastfeeding in both the countries. In Bolivia, timely initiation of breastfeeding went from 56% in 2000 to 69% in 2001 and reached 74% by the end of 2003. In Madagascar, the initiation rate went from 34% at baseline in 2000 to 69% in 2001, 76% in 2002, and rose to 78% in 2004. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first month of life was also measured. At baseline in Bolivia, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first month of life was 81% (2000), decreased slightly in 200 1, and then increased to 88% by the end of the Project in 2003. In Madagascar, it started high at 86% in 2000, increased during the implementation of the programme, and by 2004, was 91%. These results were achieved quickly and sustained over the course of the intervention.

TI Risk factors and mitigation measures in public-private water sector
   partnerships: lessons from the Asutifi North District, Ghana
SO H2OPEN JOURNAL
AB Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are promoted as a practical option for developing countries to meet their water sector infrastructure gaps. Despite their appeal, PPP projects have been described as complex and challenging, and the water sector PPPs are particularly associated with high failure rates. Risk analysis and evaluations have been identified as critical to the success of PPPs. In this paper, we examine an on-going PPP arrangement for piped water supply in the Asutifi North District of Ghana under a Build, Operate, and Transfer arrangement. Safe Water Network will provide the supply systems and transfer ownership to the District Authority at the end of the contract. We reviewed key project documents to ascertain the measures that would minimize the likelihood of risk occurring during the project cycle. Of 11 risk factors, 7 were anticipated in the project documents. We recommend that project documents be reviewed and amended to address the unanticipated risks.

TI The role of trade openness for industrial sector development: panel data
   evidence from SAARC region
SO JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to focus on South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member economies to examine the impact of trade openness on the industrial sector development.
   Design/methodology/approach - Panel data econometric techniques are used to the data for the period 1980-2013 for the selected six countries, namely, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
   Findings - It is found that trade openness has positively and significantly influenced the industrial sector of the sampled countries. Other determinants such as education and investment have also played a key role in helping the selected developing countries to develop their industrial sectors.
   Practical implications - The study suggests the policy-makers of the SAARC member countries to liberalize international trade substantially to enhance the contributions of industrial sector toward gross domestic product (GDP) and to achieve the dreamed goal of sustainable long-run growth for the region.
   Originality/value - An explicit relationship between trade openness and industrial sector of the SAARC member economies is yet to be examined.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE
CT 6th International Congress of Plant Pathology
CY JUL 28-AUG 06, 1993
CL MONTREAL, CANADA
AB Aided by a political resolve, the dedication of their scientists, and strong international support, many developing countries made remarkable progress in achieving self-sufficiency in food and natural fiber during the last two decades. However, increasing population and commercialization of agriculture in these countries have put enormous pressure on the resources needed for a sustained growth in agricultural production. Limited arable lands are being overexploited reducing their productivity. Erosion-prone marginal lands are being brought under cultivation. Faulty irrigation practices, coupled with poor drainage, have made many areas less productive than before. Several time-tested stable cropping systems have been given up in favor of new, unstable systems to obtain higher yields per unit area. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers and pesticides has led to serious unforeseen problems adversely affecting the stability of crops. In spite of these setbacks, there is hope of achieving sustainable growth in agricultural production. This can be done by improving land and water management practices; discovering stable, high-productivity farming systems including crops and livestock; evolving better, environment-friendly crop health management practices; using new biotechnology tools; supporting international agricultural research centers sponsored by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research; involving nongovernmental organizations and government agencies in efforts to educate and support farmers; and most important of all, implementing innovative programs to reduce population growth rates with the total commitment of the concerned governments.

TI Moving Forward Together
SO ECO2 CITIES: ECOLOGICAL CITIES AS ECONOMIC CITIES
AB The Eco(2) Cities Initiative is a collaborative exercise that requires close working relationships among all stakeholders and a willingness to consider and apply new concepts and methods together. Of course, cities are in the driver's seat. This book is designed to explain the key principles of Eco(2)-how they translate into core elements and stepping stones-and to introduce cities to some of the methods and tools that will enable them to develop their own Eco(2) pathways. The opportunities for positive change are great at this time. We strongly encourage cities to take the first step toward ecological and economic sustainability, while the window of opportunity to achieve lasting impact is still open.
   For forward-looking cities in developing countries that intend to adopt the Eco(2) approach, support may be available from best practice cities worldwide; the international community, including donor agencies; and academia. Cities are encouraged to tap the unique resources of each of these partners. In this context, the World Bank Group, together with other development partners, is in a position to provide technical assistance, capacity-building support, and financial support to cities that demonstrate a strong commitment to the implementation of the Eco(2) initiative.

TI Antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV transmission in serodiscordant
   couples in China (2003-11): a national observational cohort study
SO LANCET
AB Background On the basis of the results of the randomised clinical trial HPTN 052 and observational studies, WHO has recommended that antiretroviral therapy be off ered to all HIV-infected individuals with uninfected partners of the opposite sex (serodiscordant couples) to reduce the risk of transmission. Whether or not such a public health approach is feasible and the outcomes are sustainable at a large scale and in a developing country setting has not previously been assessed.
   Methods In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included treated and treatment-naive HIV-positive individuals with HIV-negative partners of the opposite sex who had been added to the national HIV epidemiology and treatment databases between Jan 1, 2003 and Dec 31, 2011. We analysed the annual rate of HIV infection in HIVnegative partners during follow-up, stratifi ed by treatment status of the index partner. Cox proportional hazards analyses were done to examine factors related to HIV transmission.
   Findings Based on data from 38 862 serodiscordant couples, with 101 295.1 person-years of follow-up for the seronegative partners, rates of HIV infection were 2.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI 2.4-2.8) among the 14 805 couples in the treatment-naive cohort (median baseline CD4 count for HIV-positive partners 441 cells per mu l [IQR 314-590]) and 1.3 per 100 person-years (1.2-1.3) among the 24 057 couples in the treated cohort (median baseline CD4 count for HIV-positive partners 168 cells per mu l [62-269]). We calculated a 26% relative reduction in HIV transmission (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.84) in the treated cohort. The reduction in transmission was seen across almost all demographic subgroups and was signifi cant in the fi rst year (0.64, 0.54-0.76), and among couples in which the HIV-positive partner had been infected by blood or plasma transfusion (0.76, 0.59-0.99) or heterosexual intercourse (0.69, 0.56-0.84), but not among couples in which the HIV-positive partner was infected by injecting drugs (0.98, 0.71-1.36).
   Interpretation Antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive individuals in serodiscordant couples reduced HIV transmission across China, which suggests that the treatment-as-prevention approach is a feasible public health prevention strategy on a national scale in a developing country context. The durability and generalisability of such protection, however, needs to be further studied.

   Practices
SO ASIAN PERSPECTIVE
AB In this study we analyze Korea's official development assistance (ODA) projects in Sri Lanka to derive policy issues for sustainable development of developing countries. In a two-step process, we first propose improvements based on the results of ODA projects in Sri Lanka, and second derive policy issues for improvements proposed in the first step through a Delphi analysis of expert surveys. Improvements are summarized in four categories: enhancing environmental policies in developing countries through specialized ODA projects, enhancing public awareness of environmental issues through ODA projects that directly benefit citizens, increasing communication and cooperation between recipient and donor countries through jointly planned ODA projects, and implementing follow-up management of ODA projects. The results of the study not only can contribute to the effective implementation of future ODA projects but also can be used as basic data to examine when establishing national policies.

TI Identifying Measures of Effective Risk Management for Public-Private
   Partnership Infrastructure Projects in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The inadequate risk management of public-private partnership (PPP) projects is a principal cause of project distress or failure. This research seeks to identify and empirically validate measures of effective risk management (ERM) in the context of PPPs in a developing country, a subject that has received scant attention in the extant literature. The research is based on a comprehensive literature review, expert interviews and a questionnaire survey. Mean score ranking and factor analysis were employed to rank and group the identified measures, respectively. Tests were performed to determine the respondents' agreement and establish the reliability and validity of the survey instrument. Analysis results indicate that all identified measures are important, are distributed over the entire project's life cycle and exhibit a multi-organizational focus. The most significant measures focus on PPP-specific artifacts and procurement activities that are vital for ERM. Factor analysis established six critical underlying dimensions for the ERM of PPP projects. The extracted factors generally acknowledge the need for expert public- and private-sector project stakeholders with mature organizational structures, business processes and relevant experience to successfully handle and deliver PPP projects. Furthermore, a comprehensive PPP policy and sound legal and regulatory frameworks are essential for supporting the ERM of PPP projects. The findings will enable a better understanding of factors that influence the quality and outcomes of risk management efforts and promote sustainable infrastructure development via PPPs, where the success of a project strongly relies on positively managing a project's risks in the economic and the social domains.

AB This study is on people's trust with service delivery by governments in the globalized world. Various non-governmental organizations (private firms like corporate houses, non-profitable organizations and community based organizations) are also participating in service delivery along with government institutions. These type of organizations are taking active part in service delivery like providing infrastructure, collaborating with government etc., which are popularly known as PPPs and Third Party Service Delivery. Developing countries governments are unable to deliver proper services for huge masses due to lack of resources, technical knowledge coupled with unfair practices like corruption redtapisam in the government systems. To overcome all these constraints neo liberalized concepts provided Public Private Partnerships (PPP) as an alternative approach to the governments for service delivery. In the developing countries some people are paying for the qualitative services (as Consumers, they will buy the service from the government as well as private), some sections of people are ready to pay for the services if necessary (as receivers), but maximum number of sections are demanding services from the government without any cost (as beneficiaries). Government would deliver large scale services with utilizing minimum state owned resources in the form of PPP and Third party governance in a sustainable way. Gaining trust from these sections of people is very important for governments to break the distrust. Main findings of the paper includes that the people's trust in government is based on the experience of government institution tends to extend to other institutions. Secondly, political variables have the strongest overall effect on the inconsistencies of people's trust in government. Public trust in government is also influenced by the way of service delivery based on the efficient effective and cost benefit services.

TI Public-private sector partnership in household waste management as
   perceived by residents in south-west Nigeria
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB In most developing countries public-private sector partnership is becoming increasingly applied in household waste management service delivery especially in urban areas to reduce cost and improve effectiveness. This paper reports a study of householders' perceptions of public-private sector partnership in provision of household waste management services in Ilorin, south-west Nigeria. A multistage random sampling technique was used to select 224 households for the study. The data generated from the survey were analysed using a binary logit model. The results show that most of the respondents were of the opinion that the public-private partnership has not been able to improve household waste management services. Time taken to visit solid waste collection point, income and marital status negatively influenced their perceptions, while activities of sanitary inspectors, occupation and gender had positive influence. The public-private partnership will be more effective and sustainable if the public sector could pay more attention to performance monitoring and accountability.

TI Aid for trade and ecologically sustainable development in Australia's
   international aid program
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB In September 2015, Australia, along with 193 member states of the United Nations, signed the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The facilitation of international trade and increasing foreign aid for developing countries were emphasised as crucial means for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. An important role was assigned to the international Aid for Trade initiative, which is about stimulating economic growth in developing countries through removing constraints to trade. Australia has been a strong supporter of the Aid for Trade initiative since it was launched at the World Trade Organization's Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005. Aid for trade has become a central plank of the new development paradigm' of Australia's international aid program. This article analyses the conceptualisation and practice of aid for trade in Australia's aid, with a focus on how it links to ecologically sustainable development. It argues that Australia's aid for trade is reinforcing the neo-liberal development paradigm in which environmental dimensions are overall neglected and private sector development and free trade are prioritised. In order to achieve international and national development goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development, environmental sustainability needs to be fully integrated into the growing aid for trade portfolio of Australia's international aid.

AB mHealth has a vast potential to help alleviate health challenges in developing countries, especially where there is a high growth in ICT adoption. However, many initiatives face various challenges, especially in going beyond the initial pilot funding stage. This paper uses the case of Sahabat Bundaku, a suite of mobile health applications for mother and child health, to illustrate the process and challenges of mHealth development, application and sustainability in resource constrained settings. Key lessons include (1) the importance of having a flexible engagement strategy combining top down and bottom up support, with different aspects of the program needing more support either from the top, or initiative from the frontline actors, (2) the varying needs and capacities, (3) the importance of combining technology introduction with a high-touch, low technology approach, with more face-to-face or physical interaction complementing or easing the way for technology, and (4) the importance of flexible partnership development, with multiple non-exclusive partners ensuring sustainability and growth of different aspects of the mHealth application.

TI The EU's preferential trade agreements with Singapore and Vietnam.
   Market vs. normative imperatives
SO CONTEMPORARY POLITICS
AB By negotiating Free Trade Agreements the EU aspires both to increase the competitiveness of its industry and contribute to sustainable development in the partner country. It pursues a flexible approach to norm promotion which aims at supporting developing countries in their attempt to adjust to international standards. Ideational and institutionalist scholars interpreted this approach as a manifestation of its normative power. We show that in the negotiations with Singapore and Vietnam the positions of the EU were not consistent with its declared goals, since they put stronger pressures upon Vietnam to adjust to regulatory standards. We explain this lack of consistency as the result of different patterns of interest group mobilization in the two negotiations. Those patterns, in turn, depend upon the bargaining power the EU has with single trade partners, competition between the EU and third countries, especially the US, and the structure of the economy of the trade partners.

AB The creative economy is considered by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as an emerging concept that involves several links between creativity, culture, economics and technology in a contemporary world dominated by images, sounds, texts and symbols.
   As a result of creative economy, emerge the creative industries that promote economic growth while preserving and promoting cultural heritages and diversity, providing economic opportunities for developing countries by opening new and dynamic growth opportunities in world trade. The creative economy allows the development of new business from international trade and trade negotiations, and represents an attractive market for developed and developing countries.
   The creative economy has become an important issue of the international economic and development agenda during this century, taking into account the idea that creativity involves culture, infuses a human development and constitutes the key ingredient for job creation, innovation and trade while contributing to social inclusion, cultural diversity and environmental sustainability.
   This research has been developed in order to better understand the concept of creative economy, concept that is becoming increasingly important in our modern knowledge-based economy, giving this industry the opportunity to promote not only growth and job creation, this industry also promotes cultural identity, item that play an important role in fostering cultural diversity.
   This is why within the sources of information used to conduct this research, there have been reviewed the official websites of several agencies that dedicate activities to promote creative economy worldwide, among others.

AB Over the past decade or so substantial progress has been made in the development of a political framework for the conservation and sustainable utilization of agro-biodiversity. The conclusion of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture has led to key policy developments, addressing both the urgent need for long-term conservation and sustainable use of threatened genetic resources world-wide, as well as the need for appropriate access conditions and the equitable sharing of benefits.
   Advances in molecular genetics and information technologies have been dramatic and are very relevant to conservation and sustainable utilization of genetic resources in general. The world also faces the globalization of economies and a shift in property rights, particularly the use of patents to protect biological inventions. These developments have a significant impact on conservation and use of ornamental genetic resources and have coincided with a decrease in governmental support to agricultural research, including conservation activities, particularly in developing countries. As these countries also lack financial resources, technologies and adequately trained human resources to exploit the locally available genetic diversity, they face the dilemma of having significant genetic resources without being able to reap the benefits of their use. Consequently, these countries have no real incentive to invest in conservation activities.
   In the above context this paper will analyse the consequences of these developments for the conservation and use of ornamental genetic resources. It will also assess the need and the conditions for strategic partnerships between developing countries, the private sector, and national and international agricultural research institutions, so as to achieve both reliable, efficient long-term conservation goals and sustainable utilization solutions for the benefit of all.

AB Although progress has been made in every area of sustainable energy, energy poverty still involves a large proportion of the population living in developing countries which are often grid isolated and scattered. To overcome this situation, renewable off-grid distributed energy systems, that are sustainable also without donor funds and that can grow together with the community awareness and wellness, still have to be developed. Within off-grid renewable distributed energy systems solar irrigation systems allow to boost local food production, answering to basic needs and improving in a direct way the standard income, thus, representing a first solid step in creating a self-sustaining circle.
   Starting from a close and comprehensive knowledge of the territory, of the targeted users' needs and social conditions, given by the "Employ project", an irrigation system for a specific area is described. Technical-economic feasibility of different solar pumping solutions (water storage, direct photovoltaic coupling, battery storage) have been analyzed for the irrigation system.
   Direct solar irrigation system is found to be the simplest, most efficient and lowest cost solution. However, it needs to be properly evaluated with data on water needs and specific weather conditions. Thus, efficient, economic, adaptable and scalable solutions, not only in Soddo, Wolayta Region, but even in other rural areas of neighboring regions can be implemented. The study aims to underline that smaller and simpler systems, if studied in-depth and sized in accordance with the local conditions, can represent a solid base to build off-grid modular, scalable and replicable solutions for developing countries. This avoids the initial barriercreated by high capital costs and fight the dependence on external grants, fostering thus a more comprehensive, step by step development.

TI Conservation-compatible livelihoods: An approach to rural development in
   protected areas of developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Effective protected area (PA) management should deliver better conservation results and improved welfare for local people, especially for many developing countries (DCs) with megabiodiversity, where pressing conservation demands for global value and urgent economic growth requirements for local development co-exist. Here, we proposed a conservation compatible livelihoods approach that forms a closed loop of rural livelihoods and biodiversity conservation to support the policy design of effective protected area (PA) management in the DCs. By reviewing the transition of conservation discourse from "fortress conservation" to "community conservation", the conservation-compatible livelihoods approach returns to the principle of human-land reciprocity, and aims to regulate the local resource utilisation through recognition of biodiversity values of global meaning. We define conservation-compatible livelihoods (CCLs) by deepening the meaning of sustainable livelihoods and strengthening cultural inclusiveness. Building on literature and practices, we provided a typology of various CCLs and a triple judgement procedure strengthening the different needs as a mutual decision-making process and facilitating realistic livelihood alternatives not exclusive of traditional wisdom for developing CCLs. We presented the mechanism model of CCLs to illustrate how to achieve a fair and sustainable livelihood through value generation based on the resource endowments, and through the cooperation of stakeholders. Finally, we discussed the trends for the CCLs approach to take effect and why this systematic approach can apply to DCs for their self-reliant development.

TI Digital technologies (DT) adoption in agri-food supply chains amidst
   COVID-19: an approach towards food security concerns in developing
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING
AB Purpose This study aims to explore the critical factors for digital technologies (DT) adoption to develop a sustainable agri-food supply chain (AFSC). As the developing countries are struggling to survive during COVID-19, DT adoption in AFSC can bring resilience and minimizes the food security concerns. Design/methodology/approach The study has used Fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methods for identifying the critical success factors (CSFs) for DT adoption and inter-relationship among them to explore the crucial factors for food security across AFSC. Findings The research reveals that "Digital Technologies, Logistics and infrastructure" is the most crucial CSF for managing food security in developing economy during the COVID-19 situation. This factor supports the decision-makers to manage data for demand and supply management and helps to survive and sustain in the disruptive environment. The findings of the study will help farmers and supply chain partners to manage the smooth flow of food items from source to end-users during a disruptive environment. The sourcing, manufacturing and delivery methods are needed to be changed with DT inclusion and may support to redesign their internal systems for improvisation. This shorter AFSC will enhance the resilience in AFSCs. Research limitations/implications The emergency situation raised by the COVID-19 pandemic has brought global food security concerns. Adoption of DT across AFSCs can strategically reduce food waste and optimize the demand and supply balance. Originality/value The study aims to build a comprehensive framework by identifying the CSFs to develop resilient and sustainable AFSC amidst COVID-19.

   multidisciplinary partnership: a case study of the Kenyan National
   Retinoblastoma Strategy group
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: Strategic, interdisciplinary partnerships are essential to addressing the complex drivers of health inequities that result in survival disparities worldwide. Take for example the aggressive early childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma, where survival reaches 97 % in resource-rich countries, but is as low 30 % in some resource-limited nations, where 92 % of the burden lies. This suggests a need for a multifaceted approach to achieve a tangible and sustainable increase in survival.
   Methods: We assembled the history the Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy (KNRbS), using information documented in NGO reports, grant applications, news articles, meeting agendas and summaries. We evaluated the KNRbS using the principles found in the guide for transboundary research partnerships developed by the Swiss Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing Countries.
   Results: A nationally co-ordinated approach drawing input and expertise from multiple disciplines and sectors presented opportunities to optimise cure of children with retinoblastoma. Annual meetings were key to achieving the over 40 major outputs of the group's efforts, related to Awareness, Medical Care, Family Support and Resource Mobilization. Three features were found to be critical to the KNRbS success: multidisciplinarity, consistency and flexibility.
   Conclusion: The KNRbS has achieved a number of key outputs with limited financial investment. As a partnership, the KNRbS meets most of the criteria identified for success. Challenges remain in securing the long-term sustainability of its achievements. Elements of the Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy may be useful to other developing countries struggling with limited survival of retinoblastoma and other cancers or rare diseases.

AB The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD) was launched by the General Assembly of the United Nations in November 1980 with the goal "to provide all people with water of safe quality and adequate quantity and basic sanitary facilities by 1990".  The World Bank estimates that despite the efforts during the Decade less than 50 percent of developing country populations have access to adequate water supplies and only 20 percent to adequate sanitation facilities.
   Major factors for the situation are the continuing population explosion and the economic stagnation of developing countries.  Qualitative breakthroughs have been made however, through (i) improved coordination for sector inputs at the global and country levels, (ii) systematic formulation of country strategies, (iii) rationalization of the management of the sector, and most significantly through (iv) community involvement and (v) the adoption of low-cost sustainable and replicable technolgies.  The UNDP/World Bank Programme and the UNDP/WHO Decade Programmes have played a catalytic role in developing activities in these five areas.
   To maintain Decade momentum beyond 1990 and to accelerate the provision of water supply and sanitation services to all, with emphasis on the unserved rural and peri-urban poor, by using a coordinated programme "Decade"approach, a Framework for Global Cooperation has been established.  A series of meetings of a Collaborative Council of External Support Agencies (ESAs) is involved, leading to a global consultation in India in 1990 for all developing countries to define and achieve consensus on a water and sanitation sector strategy for "Beyond the Decade".

TI The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP)
   Knowledge Hub: developing an open platform for facilitating high-quality
   clinical research
SO TRIALS
AB There is stark global inequity in health research in terms of where studies happen, who leads the research and the ultimate beneficiaries of the results generated. Despite significant efforts made, limited research ideas are conceptualised and implemented in low-resource settings to tackle diseases of poverty, and this is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. There is strong evidence to show that the barriers to locally led research do not vary largely between disease, study type and location and can be largely solved by addressing these common gaps. The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. EDCTP has established a model of long-term sustainable capacity development integrated into clinical trials which addresses this lack of locally led research in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the development of individual and institutional capacity and research outputs that change the management, prevention and treatment of poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases across Africa. In recognition of emergent data on what the barriers and enablers are to long-term, sustainable capabilities to run studies, EDCTP formed a new collaboration with The Global Health Network (TGHN) in September 2017, with the aim to make a set of cross-cutting tools and resources to support the planning, writing and delivery of high-quality clinical trials available to research staff wherever they are in the world, especially those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) via TGHN platform. These new resources developed on the 'EDCTP Knowledge Hub' are those identified in the mixed method study described in this commentary as being key to addressing the gaps that the research community report as the most limiting elements in their ability to design and implement studies. The Knowledge Hub aims to make these tools freely available to any potential health research team in need of support and guidance in designing and running their own studies, particularly in low-resource settings. The purpose is to provide open access to the specific guidance, information and tools these teams cannot otherwise access freely. Ultimately, this will enable them to design and lead their own high-quality studies addressing local priorities with global alignment, generating new data that can change health outcomes in their communities.

TI National policy and SMEs in technology transfer: the case of Israel
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Increasing the rate of climate technology transfer is a critical concern. The international community facilitates the development and deployment of climate technologies for the needs of the South in two primary ways: first, through the use of multilateral frameworks for technology transfer and, second, through in-country capacity building for research, development, and deployment in developing countries. However, scant attention is given to whether national-level frameworks in industrialized countries can support technology transfer. This issue may be of particular relevance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developed countries, due to their relative lack of experience in international markets. The barriers that prevent SMEs from developing and exporting more technologies to the South are identified, by using Israel as a case study. Although Israel is an important global source of climate technology innovation, it currently does not engage much with the developing world. Four principle barriers to greater involvement of OECD SMEs in technology transfer for climate mitigation in developing countries are: (1) lack of knowledge of market needs in developing economies, (2) lack of financial mechanisms to support R&D, (3) lack of opportunities for partnership building, and (4) lack of support for demonstration sites in developing countries.

The six countries did not make great advances in policy integration in support of sustainable development in the 1990s in terms of policy coordination, cooperation or coherence, but some did better than others. The countries showed considerable variation in the effectiveness with which they implemented their industrial development and environmental policy regimes. Lastly, the impact of industry on sustainable development also varied considerably, depending on which economic, social and environmental parameters were used to assess their contribution.

TI COVID-19 and the call for 'Safe Hands': Challenges facing the
   under-resourced municipalities that lack potable water access - A case
   study of Chitungwiza municipality, Zimbabwe
SO WATER RESEARCH X
AB Billions of people living in developing countries lack access to safe drinking water, not to mention water for handwashing, one of the most effective ways to contain the fast spreading novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The recent global spread of COVID-19 has fostered diverse initiatives such as the 'Safe Hands' challenge led by the World Health Organization. Individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40-60 s under running water with soap. This call for 'Safe Hands' comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in Africa is heightened. In this article, Chitungwiza city in Zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the 'Safe Hands' challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face. To do so, interviews were conducted at water points/boreholes used by residents during Zimbabwe's COVID-19 national lockdown. The calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water-stressed regions to effectively implement 'Safe Hands'. On average, it was established that one person consumes an extra 4.5 L per day of water when they practice WHO 'Safe Hands' in the context of COVID-19. This increases domestic water demand in Chitungwiza by 9%. Due to water scarcity, people in Chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing 'Safe Hands'. With their 'dry taps' woes, they might not be able to meet the standards of this WHO challenge. Lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the 'Safe Hands' challenge. This paper proposes short- and long-term measures that would allow effective implementation of the 'Safe Hands' by means of sustainable potable water supply. These measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior. Municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships (PPPs) to create immediate and long-term water investments. Structural and transformational reforms would enhance, through flexible planning, investments for both water infrastructure and governance. This narrative has the potential to improve the urban water systems resiliency against future pandemics. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   prices and carbon emissions: evidence from Gulf Cooperative Council
   economies
SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB We investigate the asymmetric nonlinear link between foreign direct investment, oil prices, and CO2 emissions for the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, using foreign direct investment and oil price data. As foreign direct investment is positively associated with carbon emissions in the long run and oil prices have positive, significant effects on CO2 emissions, our findings support the pollution-haven hypothesis. Furthermore, these variables have an asymmetric nonlinear relationship, which corresponds to the theoretical expectations of the pollution-haven hypothesis. We also find that negative changes in foreign direct investment have positive, significant impacts on carbon emissions in the short run, implying that foreign enterprises utilize green technologies in their manufacturing processes in the short run. In the long run, however, negative changes in oil prices are positively associated with carbon emissions. These findings should help Gulf Cooperation Council economies focus on policies that encourage foreign direct investment in green rather than dirty industries in order to ensure environmental sustainability.

AB International collaborations in the context of Disaster Resilience (DR) is pivotal due to several reasons. It helps to propose ways to create more coherent international approaches on disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and resilience strengthening; it helps to enhance risk management capabilities by bridging the gap between science and legal/policy issues; it helps to address the issue of efficient management of trans-boundary crises. The need to optimise international cooperation in relation to resourcing research, capacity building to undertake research and facilitating its uptake is mentioned throughout the Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR). Given their different capacities, as well as the linkage between the level of support provided to them and the extent to which they will be able to implement the SFDRR, developing countries require an enhanced provision of means of implementation, including adequate, sustainable and timely resources, through international cooperation and global partnerships for development, and continued international support, so as to strengthen their efforts to reduce disaster risk. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of engagement of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in developing countries in Asia in international collaborations to improve their Research and Innovation (R&I) capacities in DR. Based on a project entitled ASCENT (Advancing Skills Creation and Enhancement), the findings of the paper focuses on three Asian countries, i.e. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Other than an extant literature review, the paper findings are drawn from a questionnaire survey carried out in eight HEIs from the said countries. There are already several regional initiatives that promote collaboration among HEIs towards building resilience. These networks should be supported and encouraged to grow. These global networks should collaborate with existing bodies to ensure that the role of higher education is understood and can be made use of. Findings of this paper supports the need for an enhanced international partnership to improve the science-policy interface in DR and to achieve the objectives of the SFDRR. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI Critical Success Factors for Smallholder Inclusion in High Value-Adding
   Supply Chains by Food & Agribusiness Multinational Enterprises
SO INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Food and Agribusiness Multinational Enterprises (F& A MNEs) increasingly wish to source from smallholders to secure and stabilize the supply of agricultural commodities in high value-adding supply chains, while contributing positively to smallholder livelihood. In the literature we found that many F& A MNEs have been involved in supporting smallholder farming systems in developing countries for a long time. However, these projects have principally been driven by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies. Moreover, despite many pilots to include smallholders in high value-adding supply chains, scaling or scaling up successful pilots has so far proven elusive. The aim of the present article is to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) that can help F& A MNEs to design and implement sourcing strategies for sustainable smallholder supply from a business perspective, and to scale up successful pilot projects from a business perspective.

TI Barriers in sustainable industry 4.0: a case study of the footwear
   industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING
AB Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has a great perspective in the reshaping the industry as it creates a working environment of integrated productivity between workers and machines. However, the adoption of I4.0 in developing countries like India needs deliberation in the perception of sustainability. This paper aims to identify sustainable I4.0 barriers and evaluates interrelationship amongst the barriers. Twenty barriers to sustainable I4.0 are determined from the literature review. Expert's opinions are taken to finalise the identified barriers. Data are collected from Indian footwear industries and have been further analysed using the Fuzzy-DEMATEL approach. The results show that 'Lack of new organizational policy', 'Lack of customer feedback and cooperation towards I4.0 and sustainable practices,' and 'Lack of infrastructure' are the most significant barriers. The study guides the industries of developing economies to formulate an effective strategy for the adoption of I4.0. The future scope of the survey includes an extension to other emerging economies to improve the reliability and validation.

TI Capabilities in, capabilities out: overcoming digital divides by
   promoting corporate citizenship and fair ICT
SO ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This conceptual article discusses strategies of corporations in the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector and their role in the conflict over access to knowledge in the digital environment. Its main hypothesis is that ICT corporations are very capable actors when it comes to bridging digital divides in both developed and developing countries-maybe even the most capable actors. Therefore, it is argued that ICT corporations could use their capabilities to help citizens gain sustainable access to knowledge in order to enable them to lead self-sufficient lives. In a nutshell, capabilities are presented as both the input (capabilities of ICT corporations) as well as the output (capability building for empowering citizens) of corporate strategy-making focusing on fair ICT. Corporate citizenship is put forth as the theoretical concept bridging corporate strategies and access to knowledge: If ICT corporations act in accordance with their self-understanding of being 'good corporate citizens', they could be crucial partners in lessening digital divides and helping citizens gain access to knowledge. From the perspective of 'integrative economic ethics' (Ulrich 2008), it is argued that ICT corporations have good reason to actively empower citizens in both developed and developing countries by pursuing 'inclusive' strategies in many fields, such as open-source software development. That way, ICT corporations could enable, support and provide citizens with capabilities enabling them to help themselves. In order to make inclusive business models work, the rules and regulations companies find themselves in today must enable them to act responsibly without getting penalized by more ruthless competitors. This article explores several cases from the ICT field to illustrate the interplay between a responsible business model and the rules and regulations of the industry. From a capabilities perspective, the most desirable mix of corporate strategies and industry regulation is one that results in the highest level of generativity (Zittrain 2008). Thus, ICT should not be closed systems only driven by the company behind them. Instead, they need to be open for the highest possible level of third-party innovation.

TI The Institutional Status of the BRICS and Pragmatic Cooperation: The
   Case of South America
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), a group of emerging powers, is a pragmatic political group in which members are not always in agreement. Internal cooperation in BRICS evolved, becoming more "institutional" with the creation of its financial institutions, the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingency Reserve Agreement (CRA), which have led the group to the next stage in its development without changing its essence. The NDB was created to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging and developing countries, and the CRA to provide liquidity to countries that face balance of payments difficulties and to future economic crises. Many developing countries are keenly observing these financial institutions. A number of South American countries appear particularly interested in these financial institutions, and would like to attract investments and obtain loans from BRICS to develop the infrastructures of their countries, and to build informal relationships with foreign partners, but without the same level of political commitments as those between BRICS members. South American countries see BRICS as an example of pragmatic cooperation that is different to the modus operandi of traditional powers, and its financial institutions as an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for financial aid. The relations between BRICS and South America are characterized by a pragmatic approach reflecting the ethos of the group and the necessity for modernization in South America. This article analyzes the particular relationship that BRICS is establishing with South American countries, using its institutional status and pragmatic approach.

TI Irrigation Governance in Developing Countries: Current Problems and
   Solutions
SO WATER
AB The evolution of water governance and societal perception in large, public irrigation systems in developing countries has triggered successive waves of reforms since the 1980s. Among them are Participatory Irrigation Management, Irrigation Management Transfer, Public-Private Partnerships or Market Instruments. Reforms have generalized the implementation of Water Users Associations (WUAs) in continuous interaction with a public Irrigation Agency. This paper set out to review recurrent problems and reported solutions in the governance of irrigated areas in developing countries and to relate solutions to problems in a case study context. The combination of literature review and the experience of the authors permitted identification and characterization of eight problems and eight solutions. A semi-quantitative approach was designed to relate solutions to problems in case study WUAs. The approach is based on the definition of a generic problem-solution matrix and a WUA-specific problem vector. The solution vector indicates the adequacy of each solution to a case study WUA. It can be obtained by multiplying the problem vector with the problem-solution matrix. Application of this approach to seven case study WUAs demonstrated its potential. Local fine-tuning of the coefficients defining the problem-solution matrix seems required to draw conclusions effectively guiding decision-making.

TI Bridging Local Governments and Residents for Household Waste Source
   Separation Using a Business-Driven, Multi-Stakeholder Cooperative
   Partnership Model-A Case Study of HUGE Recycling in Yuhang, Hangzhou,
   China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Rapid economic development has led to an overwhelming surge in waste generation, demanding urgent and comprehensive waste management solutions, particularly in developing countries. Source separation is a critical and indispensable step in integrated waste management and is featured as a government-led pattern in general. However, its implementation challenges persist in many cities because of complex waste systems and a lack of multi-stakeholder partnerships. Since there is a paucity of empirical research focusing specifically on the recycling business, this study presents a case study of HUGE Recycling, operating in Yuhang District, Hangzhou, China, to explore the effectiveness of a business-driven, multi-stakeholder partnership model in promoting source separation. The paper reveals that the recycling business plays a significant role in bridging the gap between local governments, residents, and the recycling industry and identifies some key factors in the business-driven, multi-stakeholder cooperative partnership model, fulfilling the requirements of multi-stakeholders. This case fosters collaboration between local governments, residents, and the recycling industry, encouraging active participation and alleviating the government's burden. The findings highlight the potential applicability of the HUGE Recycling Model to waste management in resource-constrained developing countries for better resource management.

TI International Microtrade Regime - Structure and Financing
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The conceptualization of a new form of trade, microtrade, is visualized to hold great promise in economic development of the producers belonging to LDCs and developing countries. In order to meet the goal of poverty reduction at a sustainable pace, the institutional, financial and logistical mechanisms for facilitating microtrade both at the international and national level needs to be built in a manner which ensures maximum efficiency. The paper deals with two fundamental aspects of development of microtrade. First, it delineates different aspects which would provide a strong substratum to the proposed microtrade regime. It explores the legal and institutional framework required for conduct of microtrade, which can be structured under the existing WTO regime and proposes necessary amendments to the WTO regime. Second, the paper explores financial aspects of the proposed microtrade regime. A case study of operation of micro-credit in the Indian scenario is undertaken in order to highlight the problems which have recently emerged in the microfinance sector. The scale of these problems has led the Indian government to propose a bill, regulating microfinance in India. Cue from this experience needs to be taken in order to move towards a foolproof system of financing microtrade at the local level.

TI Evaluating performance of a Lead Road Safety Agency (LRSA) in a
   low-income country: a case study from Pakistan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INJURY CONTROL AND SAFETY PROMOTION
AB The World Health Organization recommends identifying a Lead Road Safety Agency (LRSA) within the government to coordinate preventive interventions. As LRSAs in developing countries have rarely been evaluated, this case study describes the performance of the LRSA of Pakistan with respect to the World Bank criteria. The designated LRSA, the National Road Safety Secretariat, was put into operation in 2006 and worked for about two years with World Bank funding. The agency had a stand-alone structure headed by an experienced road safety specialist during the first year only and faced difficulty in recruiting other required experts. The LRSA drafted the first National Road Safety Plan, including strategic review of road safety and existing legislation, articulated multisectorial collaboration nationally and provincially, and collected traffic injury data in some districts. Its progress was halted by its dissolution because of funding problems. Currently, two agencies specialising in traffic enforcement and transport research respectively are fulfilling LRSA functions on an ad-hoc basis. Results suggest that sustainability and consistency of LRSAs in developing countries like Pakistan may only be ensured if they are legally protected, inter-ministerial, have permanent funding and are provided with the required expertise through international cooperation, so they can perform their required functions effectively.

TI Harmonizing International Trade and Climate Change Institutions: Legal
   and Theoretical Basis for Systemic Integration
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Despite increased global awareness that measures, policies and rules aimed at combating climate change may act as barriers to international trade; trade and climate change regimes continue to operate at the international level, without the desired level of coherence and harmony. While emission reduction obligations are negotiated under the purview of the United Nations Framework Convention on Change (UNFCCC); trade-related rules and regimes are under the purview of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The result is the proliferation of several international obligations, standards, procedures and requirements that ultimately make international trade more difficult; and efforts to combat climate change, less concerted. For example, the availability, affordability and accessibility of environmentally sustainable technologies (ESTs) needed in developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change is occurring at a slower pace due to different technology importation requirements, efficiency standards, trade requirements and WTO procedures; while unilateral measures adopted in developed countries such as the alternative energy programs and the "food mile" policy; currently threaten the importation of goods produced in developing countries. The result is an international legal system where emission reduction obligations overlap and sometimes conflict with trade obligations and vice versa.
   A solution to this problem is the harmonization and integration of trade and climate change obligations and institutions, through a coordinated and holistic approach. This approach would include taking into account the institutional aspects of these relationships and establishing more normative platforms for cross-fertilization between trade and climate change regimes. This paper evokes the importance of the principles of systemic integration and coherent interpretation of international law obligations laid down in Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in arguing that the idea of integrating obligations established in climate change treaties with obligations in trade instruments is a mandatory requirement of treaty interpretation and implementation under international law.

TI Sustainable Forest Management, FLEGT, and REDD plus : Exploring
   Interlinkages to Strengthen Forest Policy Coherence
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable forest management (SFM) is a concept that guides forest management and policy globally. Over the past decades, two prominent regimes have emerged at the global level that can strengthen SFM: The European Union's Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade (FLEGT) and the United Nations' mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+). However, the understanding of how FLEGT and REDD+ can interlink with SFM to strengthen forest policy coherence is limited. Enhancing knowledge about interlinkages and synergies is important in view of recent global commitments to strengthen policy coherence. This study employed content analysis of the main global policy documents related to FLEGT and REDD+ to identify (i) the potential contributions of the two regimes to SFM, and (ii) strategies to manage the interlinkages among SFM, FLEGT, and REDD+. The results revealed several potential interlinkages, such as monitoring, reporting, and verification systems, establishing the enabling conditions of SFM, and addressing drivers of forest degradation. However, the interlinkages must be managed if their potential is to be realized. For this, the study proposes three approaches to managing the interlinkages and catalyzing progress toward SFM.

TI Towards sustainable shelter provision in Africa: Kenyan experience
SO DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION
AB Rapid population growth, poverty, and unemployment especially in the urban areas of the Developing Countries have intensified the need for adequate shelter worldwide, yet investment in shelter has significantly declined. It is therefore essential as emphasised by the Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development for governments to adopt realistic and flexible shelter policies and to encourage the development of sustainable human settlements. This paper considers shelter provision not only as a means for meeting the housing needs but also to generate employment for millions of people. The links between improved shelter, increased productivity and the possibility for community involvement in the shelter provision are also considered. The paper is a culmination of what is considered priorities for local and national governments and of the international development cooperation in advocating and providing active support for shelter delivery using local resources as a common strategy of poverty reduction.

TI Evaluation of Sustainable Economic and Environmental Development
   Evidence From OECD Countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB This study analyzes the economic and environmental performance of OECD countries from 2000-2019. A by-production approach is applied, and the efficiency score is decomposed into its economic and environmental components. Unlike previous studies, the authors apply a refined model that allows for the correct modeling of by-production technology. The refined model can provide clear economic illustrations for balancing economic growth and environmental protection. The results indicate that environmental inefficiency is higher than the potential economic improvement. The environmental efficiency of OECD countries is improving, while economic performance is worsening over time. Therefore, instead of highly polluting energy, clean energy should be used to build a low-carbon economy. Worldwide, carbon-emitting countries and developed countries should shoulder their responsibilities to reduce carbon emissions and provide emission reduction funds for developing countries, while simultaneously sharing the green production technologies needed to reduce emissions.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB This article reviews the history of the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative, its activities in capacity building and policy-oriented research, and case studies at its centres in Chile, China, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania. EfD promotes research-based policies to manage natural resources as engines of development. Since 1991, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has provided funding for students from developing countries to earn a PhD at the Environmental Economics Unit (EEU) of the University of Gothenburg. Returning home, these economists face institutional and academic gaps that limit the adoption of research-based policies. In response, the first EfD centre was founded in 2004, and six more followed. Research focuses on agriculture, climate, fisheries, parks, wildlife, forestry, energy and policy design. This has yielded 200 peer-reviewed articles. Successful policy outcomes depend on relationships with policy makers, community involvement in livelihood strategies, strengthened institutional support, interdisciplinary approaches, and dissemination of research results.

TI CITES, sustainable use of wild species and incentive-driven conservation
   in developing countries, with an emphasis on southern Africa
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Over 30,000 species of animals and plants that are, or may be, detrimentally affected by international trade are listed on the Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). The Convention aims to regulate transboundary trade in species and their derivatives through a system of permits and certificates, and to ensure that such trade conforms to the principle of sustainability. In the developing world, a considerable component of its biodiversity lives outside protected areas where governments have limited potential to manage wildlife. Based on selected vertebrate and plant species, this paper concludes that: (1) use of wildlife in developing countries is more likely to be an imperative rather than a choice: (2) the legal instruments of CITES have limited capacities to ensure that international trade is sustainable; (3) sustainable use of species is best achieved by gaining the support of affected local communities; (4) community support can be maximized by the devolution of ownership or user rights of species from the state to, e.g., the communal level, and the development of effective economic incentive structures to prevent alternative land-use strategies; (5) countries in southern Africa have pioneered devolution of ownership/user rights to the district/communal level; (6) in combination with effective CITES trade controls, trade opportunities, rather than trade restrictions, are most likely to assist in the development of incentive-driven conservation strategies; (7) to avoid negative incentives and to increase awareness of livelihoods, the international CITES community may need to consider whether CITES Appendices I and II listing decisions should be based not only on biological/trade criteria but also on socio-economic considerations, if it is in the conservation interest of the species concerned; (8) a strategic cooperation with the Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) could improve strategies for sustainable trade; (9) while incentive-driven conservation can provide significant longer-term potential for the protection of animal and plant species, it may be most difficult to achieve for species whose high-value products have a long tradition in medicinal use and (10) the conditions under which incentive-driven conservation is most likely to promote sustainable use need to be clearly identified.

SO NEW MEDIT
AB Sustainable development is regarded today as a goal which has to be reached by all countries. Therefore cooperation for development is more than ever necessary to face the global challenges such as poverty, human health, food crisis etc. Cooperation is all the more crucial as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in 2000, are gaining consensus at the international level. To achieve this objective all countries have to commit themselves to creating a favourable and dynamic international economic environment. However the current financial and economic crisis is posing many constraints and difficulties to the achievement of the MDGs by the year 2015.
   The aim of this work is to analyse the concept of financial crisis by illustrating the causes and the consequences of the current crisis and its effects on the global economy with special reference to the situation in Tunisia.

Mechanisms to avail Open Government Data (OGD) have faced challenges because of weak or non-existent statistical systems in most developing countries. Key contributors to the weaknesses include lack of technical capacity to curate and upload national statistics through ICT tools and platforms. This paper seeks to inform on the mechanisms for unlocking OGD through an inter-institutional framework of collaboration between public and private entities. The framework involves resources from KNBS, Strathmore University-@iLabAfrica and the World Bank working in an integrated approach to enhance KNBS data dissemination and information sharing capabilities in line with article 35 of the Constitution of Kenya, Statistics Act No. 4 2006 and the new Information Act of 2016.

TI Why fungibility of development aid can be good news: Pakistan case study
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB This study investigates the link between fungibility and international aid effectiveness by combining quantitative and qualitative methods; using state-of-the-art statistical analysis with in-depth interviews with key stake-holders, it provides deeper insights into fungibility and its drivers. It uses a different starting point than most studies on fungibility, namely that fungibility might actually be quite positive to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It contributes empirically to the debate on aid effectiveness and fungibility with respect to Pakistan, one of the largest recipients of Official Development Aid (ODA) over the past decades. Findings suggest that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between aid inflows and government development expenditures. While development expenditures of the government rise initially with aid inflows, expenditures actually decline with higher aid levels. Looking at the interviews for the case of Pakistan, we can conclude that this higher level of fungibility with higher aid inflows might actually be good news for recipient countries, as valid reasons to reallocate the original allocations also emerged. Our main policy implication is that donors and recipient governments should collaborate more on the allocation and redistribution of funds to ensure successful progress towards the SDGs with minimal loss of scarce resources.

TI Sustainability of telecentres in developing countries: Lessons from
   Union Digital Centre in Bangladesh
SO TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB This study examines operational sustainability of a major telecentre initiative - the Union Digital Centre (UDC) in Bangladesh - from the perspective of public-private-people's partnership (PPPP). Given the rising incidence of dropout of private entrepreneurs causing premature closure of telecentres, it is important to understand and identify key variables that affect sustainability of the scheme. In appreciation of the difficulty associated with operationalisation of the term 'sustainability' in this study we adopt 'operational sustainability' as an alternative to investigate the dynamics of sustenance. We have reviewed key literature about various dimensions of sustainability and their interrelationships in order to develop hypotheses about sustainability of the UDC and factors associated with it. Drawing on data collected from a survey of 538 private entrepreneurs and 41 interviews with government officials we show the extent to which various elements of the UDC eco-system contribute to its sustainability. The application of a structural equation model confirms that both financial and social outcomes of the UDC depend largely on inputs and contributions of various stakeholders. The paper concludes that effective engagement of private entrepreneurs is critical, as is governmental patronage, for ensuring operational sustainability of partnership-based telecentres like the UDC.

TI JOINT IMPLEMENTATION AND NORTH-SOUTH COOPERATION FOR CLIMATE-CHANGE
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
AB Joint implementation for projects addressing climate change is the subject of an ongoing debate primarily between the North and the South. That is, should the South permit investments from the North? This article examines issues ranging from cost-effectiveness to the North, and sustainable development in the South, fair compensation, carbon-sink projects, links with carbon reduction targets by the North, and effectiveness of global environmental objectives. Some of the issues are analyzed primarily from the southern perspective. The North can consider joint implementation among a portfolio of options for mitigating climate change. Even if credit for joint implementation is not given internationally, it is in the interest of the North to give internal credit for joint implementation to private enterprises in carbon tax rebates. Although joint implementation in energy efficiency benefits the South, the same cannot be said about the carbon-sink projects where problems relating to land rights, risk sharing, long-term opportunity costs, and threats to biodiversity abound. Joint implementation should be only considered in addition to the Annex I countries' commitments as one of the options for containing developing countries' emissions without compromising their development. This article concludes by supporting a pilot phase of joint implementation, which should be closely monitored.

TI Adaptation of irrigated agriculture to adversity and variability under
   conditions of drought and likely climate change: Interaction between
   water institutions and social norms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER GOVERNANCE
AB Agriculture is an important source of welfare in many developed and developing countries. It is also the most vulnerable to climate change of all the other sectors in any economy. The adaptation literature demonstrates how concerted adaptation strategies can minimize the resulting negative impacts on rural households. Adaptation may include modification of existing or developing new institutions and infrastructures to support the necessary adaptation options and strategies. Institutions can be developed by the state or by the community. The community faces a set of social norms under which it operates, that interact with new institutions and affects it adaptability to changing conditions. This paper addresses the role of official institutions and local social norms in adaptation of irrigated agriculture to adversity from changes in climatic conditions. A simple analytical framework is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of several institutions along with the existing social norms and infrastructure, using conditions of drought and flood, as representative cases of climate change. Evidence from exiting studies is used to assess the role of institutions, social norms, and infrastructures in supporting various adaptation strategies, including developing and adopting different agriculture and water management technologies and other related adaptation strategies.

TI Pro-poor animal improvement and breeding - What can science do?
SO LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB Livestock provide a wide variety of goods and services that generate income and support the livelihoods of millions of poor people in the developing world. Natural and human selections have shaped existing livestock genotypes throughout the estimated 12,000 year history since the first animal domestication. The result, in many production systems in the developing world, is a livestock genotype adapted to its environment and capable of meeting the needs of smallholder farmers. However, this adaptation is unlikely to be optimal and the rapid changes currently affecting the livestock sector, including policy and market changes, movements of germplasm frequently involving the importation of exotic breeds, and the increasing impacts of climate change are affecting the livestock genotype-environment optimum. This is challenging livestock production systems of smallholder farmers. Current challenges include: high rates of loss of the diversity in livestock populations, rapid transformation in smallholder production systems requiring significant changes in genotypes and their management; increased demand for quality and safe foods; increased market competition in a globalizing economy; increased need for complex partnership arrangements in the ever-changing livestock commodity chain; and lack of adaptive capacity to respond to the rapid system changes. Underlying all these is the general lack of strategies for genetic improvement of livestock in smallholder systems and poor livestock infrastructure in developing countries. Opportunities include increased demand for livestock products and hence potential market opportunities, and new technologies with potential to leap-frog breeding progress in developing countries. This paper analyses options for pro-poor livestock improvement in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the potential role that science - both old and new - will have, from understanding the social underpinnings to innovative technical solutions. It concludes that one of the highest priority interventions for the smallholder systems is the development of innovative approaches for the strategic use of appropriate genotypes from the available range of global breed resources. The analysis strongly suggests that the highest priority 'breeding intervention should be the provision of appropriate genotypes in a sustainable manner, underpinned by a good understanding of what breed resources exist that have demonstrated potential, where else they could be used, and how they would be delivered to smallholders. Efforts to improve/refine breeding skills of smallholders should proceed in parallel. Institutional arrangements and enabling policies are critical for the success in identifying and applying appropriate genetic technologies, improving access to input services and facilitating access to markets in order to translate productivity gains into incomes.

TI Development Policy: Revolution is an Illusion
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB Development Policy: Revolution is an Illusion? The Sustainable Development Goals have reinvigorated the debate on whether aid can and should be used to finance global collective goods. In this comment on Nikolai Hegertun's essay Aid's Silent Revolution? (En stille revolusjon av utviklingspolitikken), I argue that the statistical definition of aid does not categorically rule out such financing, for which there are precedents; that aid volumes in any case do not tell the full story about the extent and quality of donor efforts; and that many national and regional collective goods - which certainly can be financed by aid - are necessary for the production and enjoyment of global collective goods by individuals living in developing countries. Moreover, we do not know with certainty that traditional aid produces greater welfare improvements in such countries than global collective goods do. It is possible to envisage both that current global challenges will swamp aid and that they will induce international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. However, given the underlying forces of altruism and national self-interest, a gradual change in development policy is more likely than a revolution.

TI Macroeconomic challenges of scaling up aid to West African Economic and

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB The increase in Official Development Assistance for which the international community has mobilised should enable developing countries such as those of the West African Economic and Monetary Union to have the resources to achieve sustainable development goals and, more recently, to deal with the Coronavirus crisis. But this 'Big Push' of aid presents several macroeconomic challenges that this paper simulates using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The results showed that an increase in aid to West African Economic and Monetary Union countries translates into an increase in output and labour input. On the other hand, increased aid leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate and a widening of the budget deficit.

TI Rural community tourism and sustainable advantages in Nicaragua
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Rural community tourism (RCT) represents an experience of community-based tourism where local population retains control over the process and the bulk of benefits. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the study of successful RCT experiences in Nicaragua to enlarge the literature of tourism sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach - Applying the resource-based theory of the firm to tourism, the paper defines a theoretical framework where local resources and capabilities combined through organization and strategic actions result in competitive advantages at the community level reinforcing its sustainable dimension. The model is tested empirically through Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) modelling for Nicaraguan RCT experiences.
   Findings - Main findings show a good performance of empirical results, with the community dimension representing the cornerstone of the RCT project. Results remark how the presence of community tangible and intangible resources and capabilities are combined and exploited in tourism initiatives through strategies that put the preservation of the community as the central objective. This process leads to the emergence of competitive advantages that promote the sustainability of the community lifestyle, ensuring a durable approach of the rural tourism initiatives. Other interesting findings show how this type of RCT projects also promote the integration of weak rural collectives, like women and young people, or the pivotal cooperation emerging between public and private actors.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a novel framework to better understand some of the key pieces ensuring the sustainability of tourism initiatives. This theoretical setting has been applied to the case of rural areas at developing countries but could be enlarged to other contexts at developed countries having to deal with mass tourism and important related negative impacts of these activities. In sum, the main value of the paper is to provide a framework helping to identify the context that is needed to implement successful sustainable tourism experiences.

TI Facing the World: Audit of activity 2002-2010
SO JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
AB Background: Craniofacial anomalies, although uncommon, can have considerable effects on the individual, their family and society.(1-4) They carry with them a large morbidity and require a highly specialized, multidisciplinary approach to treatment. 5 Facing the World (FTW), was founded in 2002, to offer facial reconstructive surgery to children with complex, craniofacial anomalies with no prospect of local treatment, from developing countries anywhere in the world.
   Methods: We present an 8-year audit of the cases treated by FTW, where children are brought from their own countries to the UK for treatment. Patient selection takes place prior to their arrival in the UK by a multidisciplinary team. Specifically the condition has to be correctable to a degree that justifies the risks involved with the surgery, and the disruption to the child and their family.
   Results: Since inception, FTW has evaluated more than 300 cases and provided treatment in the UK for over 24 cases from 18 different countries. We present our range of cases and complications. We discuss our complication rate of 28% and mortality rate of 4% (1 case).
   Conclusions: Key to the sustainability of FTW is the development of local healthcare infrastructure within the developing countries to facilitate eventual local management of the more straightforward cases and follow up of these patients by well-trained medical staff. By establishing these programs, FTW aims to not only change these children's lives but to raise awareness, and help to expand the global craniofacial network whereby in the future, satellite partners will be present to help manage these conditions locally.

TWAS has united the most eminent scientists from the South. It currently has 350 members from 55 developing countries, including the 9 living Nobel Laureates of Third World origin. The main mission of TWAS is to promote scientific excellence for sustainable development in the South.
   In 1988, TWAS facilitated the establishment of the Third World Network of Scientific Organizations (TWNSO), a non-governmental alliance of over 133 scientific organizations, including 27 Ministries of Science and Technology and Higher Education, 42 Research Councils and 36 Academies from 70 Third World countries. TWNSO's mission is to assist in building political and scientific leadership for science- based economic development in the South and in promoting broad-based South-South and South-North partnerships in areas of science and technology critical to sustainable development.
   TWAS and TWNSO have established a number of programmes that can benefit scientists in developing countries conducting ground-based experiments for the utilization of global satellite data. These programmes include the awarding of research grants to promising space scientists to enable them to purchase equipment and spare parts needed for their experimental work, and the awarding of fellowships to space scientists in the South for research and training in other space research institutions in the South. In addition, TWNSO has recently launched a major South-South collaboration programme which will provide competitive research grants to joint research: projects (including those related to the utilization of global satellite data) involving 2-3 competent institutions from different countries in the South.

TI A New Sustainable Approach to Integrated Solid Waste Management in
   Shiraz, Iran
SO POLLUTION
AB Cities in developing countries like Shiraz in Iran face significant challenges due to a lack of an integrated solid waste management system. Climate change, soil, and water pollution are examples of environmental issues caused by improper Municipal Solid Waste Management Systems (MSWMS) in developing countries. The aim of this study is to find solutions for these environmental problems based on the experiences of developed countries. The data was collected using several methods such as visual observations, studying accessible documents of the current situation of the MSWMS in Shiraz, and participating in an interview with engineers the 'Shiraz Municipality Waste Management Organization' (SMWMO). Results present the current functional elements of MSWMS in Shiraz, Shiraz waste diversion rate (0.22), and its Zero Waste Index (.015). Moreover, the results present some recommendations to find a way to transform cities like Shiraz into zero-waste cities. Results indicate that establishing zero-waste policies, legal frameworks, and financial strategies as well as convincing private sector involvements in installing waste-to-energy facilities and a proper sanitary landfill to move the city toward optimum recycling and zero landfilling in addition to reducing consumption and maximizing diversion rate and finally sustainable development by the cooperation of government, NGOs and media programs would solve many problems of the MSWMS and would solve environmental issues in many cities.

TI More than a Question of Agency: Privatized Project Implementation,
   Accountabilities, and Global Environmental Governance
SO REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH
AB With limited success, international relations scholars have used principal-agent theory (P-A) to understand gaps in global governance. While P-A may not provide robust explanations, it is still useful for mapping long chains of complex, boundary-crossing relationships and locating the gaps that characterize global environmental governance (GEG). In this article, first I argue that we can get beyond merely locating and describing governance gaps, and start explaining them, by considering the problems of accountability that contribute to those gaps. Second, I argue that outsourced sustainable development projects, implemented by for-profit contractors, provide an under-studied and under-theorized body of cases for examining the relationship between agency and accountability. Finally, I use the example of a United States Agency for International Development post-hurricane recovery project in Grenada to suggest that when development assistance agencies privatize implementation they prioritize more economistic logics of accountability. As a result, they may enhance short-term economic efficiency and even become more accountable to their principals. But they fail to connect the means and ends of GEG, despite firmly stated, official commitments to "taking the environment into account."

TI Monitoring of progress in the establishment and strengthening of
   national immunization technical advisory groups
SO VACCINE
AB The majority of industrialized and some developing countries have established technical advisory bodies to guide and formulate national immunization policies and strategies. These are referred to as National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), WHO and its partners have placed a high priority on assisting in the establishment or strengthening of functional, sustainable, and independent NITAGs. To enable systematic global monitoring of the existence and functionality of NITAGs, in 2010, WHO and UNICEF included related questions in the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Form (JRF) that provides an official means for WHO and UNICEF to collect indicators of immunization programme performance.
   This paper presents the status of NITAGs based on the analysis of the 2010 JRF. Although 115 countries (64% of responders) reported having a NITAG in 2010, only 50% of countries reported the existence of a NITAG with a formal administrative or legislative basis. Despite limitations in the ability to compare 2010 JRF data with that from a 2008 global survey, it appears that substantial progress has been achieved globally over with 43 committees reporting affirmatively about six NITAG process indicators, compared with 23 in the 2008 survey. Impressive progress has been observed in the proportion of countries reporting NITAGs with formal terms of reference (24% increase), a legislative or administrative basis (10% increase), and a requirement for members to disclose their interests (14% increase). Some of the poorest developing countries now enjoy support from a NITAG which meet all six process indicators. These may serve as examples for other countries. (C) 2012 World Health Organization.

AB It has been recognised that cultural competency is an essential attribute in nursing and midwifery graduates entering clinical settings. Increased exposure to clients of diverse cultures has heightened the urgency to develop culturally sensitive approaches to professional practice. Therefore curricula need to include cultural content and students and faculty members need to possess culturally competent skills. To address this, the Global Health Alliance Western Australia, an innovative multi-organisational venture was developed. It provides international clinical placement exchange for nursing and midwifery students in developed and developing countries. Through this experience students/staff learn to cooperate and communicate issues from a multicultural perspective and apply methods based on clinical reasoning and evidence based practice. The Alliance furthermore facilitates professional development opportunities for emerging international nursing and midwifery leaders. The foundation partners entail the five Western Australian Universities Schools of Nursing and Midwifery, the Nurses and Midwives Board and the Department of Health.
   This paper presents findings of primary research conducted using a mixed-method approach involving interviews and work sampling observations. Included also are tools utilised for evaluation of developing countries' strengths for clinical placement in acute and community healthcare areas, as well as the assessment of clinical practice against the established nursing and midwifery registration competencies.
   While the journey is in its infancy, sharing the lessons already learnt is invaluable. Recognition of individual partner's needs in the areas of policy, regulation, education and practice is paramount to build international sustainable healthcare infrastructures. Financial support for the initiative is provided by the Department of Health, Western Australia.

TI The Role of the Climate Technology Centre and Network as a Climate
   Technology and Innovation Matchmaker for Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In this paper, the role of a matchmaker in transferring climate technologies to developing countries was explored from the perspective of open innovation. As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Technology Mechanism, the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) has strong convening power amongst the stakeholders who are responsible for climate actions in their country. Our research identified that the CTCN has successfully provided "4 openness" models (open network, open request for Technical Assistance, open technology transfer and finance, and open knowledge for the public) to global partners through its technical assistance (TA) services. Then, on the basis of previous empirical Technical Assistance data and network management a new open innovation model was proposed by considering the CTCN matchmaking activities with key stakeholders (innovation networks) during the climate technology transfer processes. This model explains that the role of the CTCN and innovation networks such as academia/research institutions, governments, and the private sector can be interpreted as outside-in innovation at the first technology outsourcing stage, coupled innovation at the second technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) stage, and inside-out innovation at the third technology diffusion stage. Moreover, further matchmaker's approaches for supporting developing countries to establish a conducive and sustainable innovation system were suggested for the extension of our new model.

TI Climate change and development cooperation: trends and questions
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, the literature and politics in the traditionally distinct development and climate change cooperation fields are recommending a merger between these fields. The development cooperation literature and politics suggest incorporating climate change into development cooperation; and the climate change literature and politics suggest better links with development cooperation. Six arguments support this shift in perspective (logical, financial, practical, developing country, stakeholder, and reporting arguments), while six arguments justify delinking these discussions (different paths to development, political sensitivity, resources needed, changing target group, global effectiveness, and the conditionality arguments). This paper concludes that while development and climate change are closely linked, there are strong reasons to argue against mainstreaming climate change into development cooperation under current political circumstances.

TI Translating sustainable fishing norms: the EU's external relations with
   Ghana
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB This article solves the puzzle of why developing countries such as Ghana are responsive to the European Union's (EU) promotion of sustainable fishing despite the fragmentation and contestation of environmental norms. Analysing the EU-Ghana interaction with rationalist and constructivist perspectives on norm diffusion, this article reveals EU counterparts' motivations for domestic fisheries reforms. It argues that although the EU exercises both 'normative power' and 'market power' to encourage sustainable fishing, EU partners are more reactive to the manipulation of material benefits associated with the European market access. By highlighting such motivations, and thus the relational aspect of EU power, this article also contributes to the EU-as-a-power debate from the often-overlooked perspective of EU partners. The findings capture the characteristics of EU influence and further illuminate the fisheries policymaking and collective action mobilisation needed for broader environmental protection.

SO TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH
AB Tourism policies and planning in Indonesia have been effective in prioritising tourism development and maintaining price competitiveness and international openness, but absent or ineffective in the crucial domains of terrorism risk management, infrastructure development, interagency coordination and cooperation, human resource development and management, and environmental sustainability. These shortcomings, despite Indonesia's democratic system of government, tourism policy and planning structures, and many tourism policy instruments, demonstrate that such mechanisms are necessary, but not sufficient, for the sustainable development of a country's tourism industry. Coverage of all crucial tourism policy and planning domains, and effective implementation of policies and plans, are also essential, and in the case of Indonesia will require the marshalling and effective deployment of substantial human and financial resources.

TI Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices:
   Findings from panel data for Vietnam
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008?2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers? knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption.

TI Bangladeshi clothing manufacturers' technology adoption in the global
   free trade environment
SO JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of technology adoption (TA) among clothing manufacturers in Bangladesh and examine the influences of contextual factors on their TA level. Particularly, the authors examined the effects of export orientation, top management commitment (TMC), competitive pressure (CP), cost of capital (CC) and technical skills (TS). Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from Bangladeshi clothing manufacturer through an online survey. A firm was treated as a unit of analysis. Findings The results revealed that the most common technologies adopted were information technology and software related and the least common were automation related. Export orientation negatively influenced while TS and CP positively influenced the level of TA. Research limitations/implications Due to the difficulty in obtaining firm level data, data collection did not utilize a random sampling. Only firms that agree to participate were included in the data. Practical implications The authors suggest the Bangladeshi clothing manufacturers to adopt selective technologies that complement the cost leadership strategy rather than immediate differentiation strategy or technology innovations. Social implications Focused investment in human capitals and knowledge transfer in Bangladesh, one of the newly classified developing country, should sustain their competitiveness in the global market. Further discussions provide various stakeholders with insights related to trade policies, international aids and the UN's sustainable development agenda. Originality/value This study tackles a void that exists in TA research within the labor intensive clothing manufacturing sector, especially in a lower-middle income country, which surprisingly became the second largest clothing supplier today. Unique nature of the sector as an entry to economic development process in connection to the sustainable development concept is discussed to generate implications for practitioners as well as policy makers.

TI European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP):
   the path towards a true partnership
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was founded in 2003 by the European Parliament and Council. It is a partnership of 14 European Union (EU) member states, Norway, Switzerland, and Developing Countries, formed to fund acceleration of new clinical trial interventions to fight the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis (TB) in the sub-Saharan African region. EDCTP seeks to be synergistic with other funding bodies supporting research on these diseases.
   Methods: EDCTP promotes collaborative research supported by multiple funding agencies and harnesses networking expertise across different African and European countries. EDCTP is different from other similar initiatives. The organisation of EDCTP blends important aspects of partnership that includes ownership, sustainability and responds to demand-driven research. The Developing Countries Coordinating Committee (DCCC); a team of independent scientists and representatives of regional health bodies from sub-Saharan Africa provides advice to the partnership. Thus EDCTP reflects a true partnership and the active involvement and contribution of these African scientists ensures joint ownership of the EDCTP programme with European counterparts.
   Results: The following have been the major achievements of the EDCTP initiative since its formation in 2003; i) increase in the number of participating African countries from two to 26 in 2008 ii) the cumulative amount of funds spent on EDCTP projects has reached (sic) 150 m, iii) the cumulative number of clinical trials approved has reached 40 and iv) there has been a significant increase number and diversity in capacity building activities.
   Conclusion: While we recognise that EDCTP faced enormous challenges in its first few years of existence, the strong involvement of African scientists and its new initiatives such as unconditional funding to regional networks of excellence in sub-Saharan Africa is envisaged to lead to a sustainable programme. Current data shows that the number of projects supported by EDCTP is increasing. DCCC proposes that this success story of true partnership should be used as model by partners involved in the fight against other infectious diseases of public health importance in the region.

AB For decades, methyl bromide was used as the fumigant of choice to rid the soil of noxious pests, diseases and weeds in the pre-plat stage, particularly in intensive agriculture around the world. Breaking the chains of the methyl bromide bondage by 2015 in developing countries - as set by the Montreal Protocol on the Substances Depleting Ozone Layer - has been a great challenge, but at the same has created an opportunity to promote a variety of non-chemical alternatives. By initiating the transition towards sustainable technologies, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) - as one of the implementing agencies of the Protocol - has been instrumental in phasing-out methyl bromide in developing countries. In partnership with local governments and institutions, UNIDO has brought the benefits of environmentally friendly alternatives to growers in various sectors around the world. Through the successful adoption of novel technologies such as vegetable grafting in Mexico, bio-control agents in Honduras, soilless systems in Turkey, biofumigation + solarization in Ecuadorean flowers or compost technology in Morocco, these growers have developed successful disease and pest management programs that not only are not reliant on methyl bromide or other soil fumigants, and which are proving to be equally efficient and sustainable in the long term. Such programs are further giving market headway to various agricultural sectors by making them more competitive in international markets, which are increasingly requiring products grown within environment-friendly standards.

AB Signing cooperation agreements is considered as the first step in building industry-academia partnership, but it is not enough as far as they stay on paper. These partnership agreements have to enhance the economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental protection and global responsibilities, while solving the industrial technical and logistic problems. Cooperation may include carrying out scientific research activities and applying the results of these researches to solve real problems of industry. The current partnership situation in Palestine shows a weak cooperation, hence steps to improve the partnership are urgent. European experience of industry-academia partnership can be the base for developing similar programs and activities for Palestine and other developing countries. This paper discusses the existing status of industry-academia partnership with relevance to engineering education and the horizons of implementing new scenarios and strategies in developing countries particularly in Palestine. In order to close the gap between academia and industry it is suggested to implement curricula improvement by including sustainability concepts on one hand and improving teaching methods on the other hand.

TI Modeling the relationship between organizational performance and green
   supply chain practices using canonical correlation analysis
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB The world is moving towards a environmental restricted scenario where excellence and growth in business is contingent upon good governance and excellent green sustainability related policies, strategies and long-term values to stay ahead in competition. Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices play an essential role in shaping the way of offering environmental sustainable products and services to customers. Existing research insists that multiple pressure push organizations to navigate towards 'eco design', 'green purchasing' and 'cooperation with customers' leading to green supply chain management. But how these factors exactly impact the organisational performance based on green supply chain management is being explored in this research. Hypothesis developed is tested by using multivariate canonical correlation analysis to model the regression relationship of 54 manufacturing organizations. Green purchasing and eco-design are the main contributors of GSCM's organisational performance. Cooperation with customer as major roadblock for organisational's performance and requires management, to ponder over for improved results. The findings coincide with published research articles that were conducted in developing countries, such as Brazil and Jordan, to ensure environmental sustainability with the integration of GSCM practices.

AB The consumption patterns of the industrialized countries are already placing a grave burden on the earth's natural resources.  If ecological disaster is to be averted, these patterns must be changed as a matter of urgency.  Equally pressing is the need to create the conditions in which the developing countries can meet the growing needs of their populations without compounding the damage caused by the developed nations.  They need an international system that offers them financial and technological support to effect the transition to strong and ecological sustainable economies.  This calls for a wholly new global partnership based on common interests, mutual need and shared responsibilities.

TI Sustaining the world's large marine ecosystems
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB In this essay, I review nearly six decades of a career in marine science and fisheries considering scientific contributions, successes, failures, and changes in my field of practice. My body of work has been in plankton research to support fisheries assessments, and in ecosystems programme development and implementation. I describe my early studies on Pacific plankton oceanography in relation to fisheries assessment, and subsequent studies of plankton oceanography and fisheries in relation to coastal ocean fisheries and management. Early in my career, realizing that applications of my published results and those of other fisheries ecologists were generally not included in fish stock assessments, I participated in a national planning group that introduced a system for marine resources monitoring, assessment, and prediction (MARMAP) that included primary productivity, ichthyoplankton, zooplankton, and oceanographic assessments as important components for large-scale fisheries ecology assessment. I joined with European colleagues in ICES to advance fisheries ecology studies in fish stock assessments in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983, I conceived with Professor Lewis Alexander of the University of Rhode Island a system for assessing and managing marine resources within the spatial domain of ecologically delineated large marine ecosystems (LMEs). On behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in partnership with developing countries, international financial organizations, UN agencies, and NGOs, I am currently contributing scientific and technical advice to a global network of assessment and management projects in 22 LMEs with 110 developing countries and $3.1 billion in financial support. The participating countries are applying a modular framework of natural science and social science indicators for assessing the changing states of LMEs. I conclude the essay with a retrospective viewpoint on my career and changes over half a century of practicing the application of marine science in relation to sustaining the goods and services of the ocean Commons.

CA NIMH Collaborative HIV STD Prev
TI Sexually transmitted disease and HIV prevalence and risk factors in
   concentrated and generalized HIV epidemic settings
SO AIDS
AB Background: in many developing countries, the threat of nascent HIV epidemics expanding rapidly requires immediate and appropriate HIV prevention activities. Inexpensive and sustainable interventions are especially relevant in resource-constrained environments. In 2001, we assessed the prevalence and behavioral risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV among at-risk populations in five developing countries in preparation for a community-randomized controlled trial, the NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial. Methods: Using a standardized protocol, more than 1000 participants in each country (China, India, Peru, Russia, and Zimbabwe) were selected by random sampling methods, completed a behavioral risk assessment, and provided biological specimens using a common laboratory protocol. Sample characteristics were studied within each country, and risk factors for HIV/STD acquisition were evaluated using logistic regression models. Results: HIV rates were low (<1%) in China, India, Peru, and Russia but were high (26%) in rural Zimbabwe. STDs were generally twice as common in women as men, and serological evidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection was the most frequently detected STD. Behavioral data showed high rates of multiple partners in the Russian sample, and very low condom use rates in India and China. Among participants who reported ever having sex, female sex and having two or more sex partners were the factors most frequently associated with an increased risk of prevalent STD. Conclusion: Behavioral or biological risks were of sufficient magnitude in the locations selected in China, Russia, and Zimbabwe to implement the community-based randomized trial. Higher-risk subsets of community residents in India and Peru were identified before beginning the Trial. (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB PFI project has face challenges due to lack of effective tool, higher construction cost, longer payback period and the complexity in quantifying the benefits of going green made this effort a tedious undertaking. In Malaysia, this situation is compounded with the lack of sustainability clauses in the concession; lack of direct incentives as well as lack of short-term financial benefits discourages both clients and contractors from embarking on the quest for sustainable development. Due to its unidentified economic benefits in a rapidly developing country such as Malaysia, the sustainable solution was usually set aside. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to identify the stakeholders' understanding and perception on the concept of sustainability and to evaluate barriers and challenges of sustainability concepts in PFI project. Essentially, the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should have a direct relationship with the principles of sustainable development. 12 respondents from various stakeholders has been interviewed and analysed has been made using Atlas ti. From the analysis, it was found that most respondents are aware of sustainability in PFI projects thus hardly see the integration. Most of the respondents are concerns more on partnership collaborations and viewed sustainability in the contexts of environment impact more than social and economic.

TI A critical analysis of unsustainable higher education
   internationalisation policies in developing economies
SO POLICY FUTURES IN EDUCATION
AB International higher education in many developed countries and more particularly in the United States and Australia has become a great source of revenue for their economies from students of the developing and underdeveloped countries (Least Development Countries). Money together with the mobility of international students from Least Development Countries to the developed world have created social inequality with no sustainable method for successful and sustainable internationalisation policies and agendas. This situation of inequality is created by a viciously interdependent circle formed by the erosion of monetary, human and linguistic capital. Calamities beyond human control including COVID-19 amplify social inequality due to the aforementioned erosion of capital. This article compares the international higher education scenes in the USA and Australia which have strong educational collaborations with a developing country like India. The piece uses extant literature in partnership with the technique of discourse analysis to provide a critical analysis of the politics of the existing internationalisation policies in international higher education and provides suggestions to deliver better internationalisation policies.

SO ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE EDUCATION
AB A partnership between a regional Australian university and the Friendship Village in Vietnam was established in 2016 as part of a health promotion unit of study. The aim of this project was to evaluate the sustainability of the international service learning model of health promotion, and its impacts upon the students and the Friendship Village. International service learning imparts personal growth, self-confidence, cultural competence, and work readiness for participating students. While these outcomes are beneficial to students, the needs of the host community and sustainability of ongoing healthcare are often be ignored, which can raise ethical concerns if not addressed. Qualitative methodology and thematic analysis were applied to survey data. Five themes emerged reciprocal learning, sustainability, building capacity of the students and the Friendship Village, and meeting the needs of the host community. One recommendation includes adequate pre-departure preparation for both partners to understand the principles of the international service learning model, means of sustainability and evaluation.

TI Toward Sustainable Management of Low-Volume Roads in Chile Improvements

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB In the past two decades, Chile has undergone a series of economic and social improvements that have put the country a few steps ahead toward development. For example, Chile has reduced poverty levels by more than 50% in less than 20 years. It is widely recognized that increasing the access of the population to basic services such as health and education is a key factor influencing development. The provision of low-volume roads (LVRs) is essential to offering that access, which should also rely on proper levels of service through sustainable management. The objective of this keynote is to describe Chile's main experiences concerning sustainable management of the LVR network and the challenges Chile will face in the future. Chile's experience with the LVR network can serve as an example for other developing countries in the same way that the country's implementation of the concession model (or public private partnerships) did for its system of main highways a few years ago.

TI Towards a Revolutionized Agricultural Extension System for the
   Sustainability of Smallholder Livestock Production in Developing
   Countries: The Potential Role of ICTs
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The creation of commercialization opportunities for smallholder farmers has taken primacy on the development agenda of many developing countries. Invariably, most of the smallholders are less productive than commercial farmers and continue to lag in commercialization. Apart from the various multifaceted challenges which smallholder farmers face, limited access to extension services stands as the underlying constraint to their sustainability. Across Africa and Asia, public extension is envisioned as a fundamental part of the process of transforming smallholder farmers because it is their major source of agricultural information. Extension continues to be deployed using different approaches which are evolving. For many decades, various authors have reported the importance of the approaches that effectively revitalize extension systems and have attempted to fit them into various typologies. However, there is a widespread concern over the inefficiency of these extension approaches in driving the sustainability of smallholder farming agenda. Further, most of the approaches that attempted to revolutionize extension have been developed and brought into the field in rapid succession, but with little or no impact at the farmer level. This paper explores the theory and application of agricultural extension approaches and argues the potential of transforming them using digital technologies. The adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones and the internet which are envisaged to revolutionize existing extension systems and contribute towards the sustainability of smallholder farming systems is recommended.

SO FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB No Poverty is the top priority among 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research perspectives, methods, and subject integration of studies on poverty reduction have been greatly developed with the advance of practice in the 21st century. This paper analyses 2,459 papers on poverty reduction since 2000 using VOSviewer software and R language. Our conclusions show that (1) the 21st century has seen a sharp increase in publications of poverty reduction, especially the period from 2015 to date. (2) The divergence in research quantity and quality between China and Kenya is great. (3) Economic studies focus on inequality and growth, while environmental studies focus on protection and management mechanisms. (4) International cooperation is usually related to geographical location and conducted by developed countries with developing countries together. (5) Research on poverty reduction in different regions has specific sub-themes. Our findings provide an overview of the state of the research and suggest that there is a need to strengthen the integration of disciplines and pay attention to the contribution of marginal disciplines to poverty reduction research in the future.

TI Measuring sustainability as a programming tool for health sector
   investments: report from a pilot sustainability assessment in five
   Nepalese health districts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainability is a critical determinant of scale and impact of health sector development assistance programs. Working with USAID/Nepal implementing partners, we adapted a sustainability assessment framework to help USAID test how an evaluation tool could inform its health portfolio management. The essential first process step was to define the boundaries of the local system being examined. This local system-the unit of analysis of the study-was defined as the health district.
   We developed a standardized set of assessment tools to measure 53 indicators. Data collection was carried out over 4 weeks by a Nepalese agency. Scaling and combining indicators into six component indices provided a map of progress toward sustainable maternal, child, health, and family planning results for the five districts included in this pilot study, ranked from "no sustainability" to "beginning of sustainability."
   We conclude that systematic application of the Sustainability Framework could improve the health sector investment decisions of development agencies. It could also give districts an information base on which to build autonomy and accountability. The ability to form and test hypotheses about the sustainability of outcomes under various funding Strategies-made possible by this approach-will be a prerequisite for more efficiently meeting the global health agenda.

AB 'Innovation' is the most common catchphrase around the globe for a great reason; likewise, it is one of the major approaches to power an economy and employment. The innovation process requires adequate fund, resources and a law for sufficient protection of the intellectual properties. Venture capitals (VCs) from risk capital finances (RCFs) are one of the best sources of gathering private equity for small companies. RCFs back those firms which are more innovative and produce more valuable patents which are protected by intellectual property rights (IPR). However, sheer negligence and inadequately unbalanced IPR culture within the software industries fail to communicate the commercial value of those assets to potential investors and business partners to grab the finances. As a result, the software companies fall short of turning their ideas into commercially viable product. Yet, a balanced IPR culture must take into account the cases of IPR abuse and secure the risk capitals. This paper researches the need of balanced IPR practices within the local small industry, predominantly software firms, which can be benefitted from it by securing the risk capital finance for their protected ideas and join the innovation race to maximise their wealth.

TI Repurposing NGO data for better research outcomes: a scoping review of
   the use and secondary analysis of NGO data in health policy and systems
   research
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB Background Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) collect and generate vast amounts of potentially rich data, most of which are not used for research purposes. Secondary analysis of NGO data (their use and analysis in a study for which they were not originally collected) presents an important but largely unrealised opportunity to provide new research insights in critical areas, including the evaluation of health policy and programmes. Methods A scoping review of the published literature was performed to identify the extent to which secondary analysis of NGO data has been used in health policy and systems research (HPSR). A tiered analytical approach provided a comprehensive overview and descriptive analyses of the studies that (1) used data produced or collected by or about NGOs; (2) performed secondary analysis of the NGO data (beyond the use of an NGO report as a supporting reference); and (3) analysed NGO-collected clinical data. Results Of the 156 studies that performed secondary analysis of NGO-produced or collected data, 64% (n = 100) used NGO-produced reports (mostly to a limited extent, as a contextual reference or to critique NGO activities) and 8% (n = 13) analysed NGO-collected clinical data. Of these studies, 55% (n = 86) investigated service delivery research topics and 48% (n = 51) were undertaken in developing countries and 17% (n = 27) in both developing and developed countries. NGOs were authors or co-authors of 26% of the studies. NGO-collected clinical data enabled HPSR within marginalised groups (e.g. migrants, people in conflict-affected areas), albeit with some limitations such as inconsistent and missing data. Conclusion We found evidence that NGO-collected and produced data are most commonly perceived as a source of supporting evidence for HPSR and not as primary source data. However, these data can facilitate research in under-researched marginalised groups and in contexts that are hard to reach by academics such as conflict-affected areas. NGO-academic collaboration could help address issues of NGO data quality to facilitate their more widespread use in research. The use of NGO data use could enable relevant and timely research in the areas of programme evaluation and health policy and advocacy to improve health and reduce health inequalities, especially in marginalised groups and developing countries.

TI Intellectual property in international relations - Technology transfer
SO SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
AB This article explores how the integration of intellectual property in international relations could facilitate the transfer of technology from the North to the South. The role of technical and development cooperation among countries is imperative to international relations. international relations enhance cooperation among countries and make possible the inflow and outflow of capital goods and services among cooperating countries. Today, people think about the North as having control over advanced technologies revolving around intellectual property, which deals with specialized issues and which is governed by such specialized branches of law as industrial property law and copyright law Considering the fact that issues pertaining to technologies are invariably an integral part of any policy designed to achieve sustainable development at all levels, integrating intellectual property discussion in international relations could facilitate acquisition of expired patents by developing countries for accelerated expansion of their social construction.

TI Impact of COVID-19 on increasing female genital mutilation (FGM) in
   Africa: A study of Tanzania and Nigeria
SO MASYARAKAT KEBUDAYAAN DAN POLITIK
AB Women's sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) have been undermined from time to time due to female genital mutilation (FGM). Women and girls experiencing FGM in many developing countries, including Tanzania and Nigeria. The aim of this study is to investigate the problems that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to the high rates of FGM in Tanzania and Nigeria. This study uses a qualitative method to see the prevalence of FGM in both countries which has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is supported by the Patriarchal theory of Sylvia Walby, which explains why men try to oppress and control women as figures who dominate society. The study results show that both Nigeria and Tanzania have seen an increase in FGM amid COVID-19, with school closures placing teenage girls at the highest risk of FGM. The study concludes that the government, private institutions, and other development stakeholders should work together to find solutions to assist communities and families in ending FGM. If these efforts arc implemented, then the 2030 sustainable development agenda can become a reality in ending FGM in Nigeria and Tanzania.

TI Development Policy and the Poor, Part 2: Preferential Option for the
   Poor
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
AB In a previous essay (Part 1), we examined the economic arguments for development policies that placed certain groups at the vanguard of development policy, making note of the place of the poor in these arguments. In this essay (Part 2), we look at the case for making the poor the central focus of development policy, following the principle in Catholic social thought of the "preferential option for the poor." That principle recommends evaluation of policies and outcomes first and foremost on how they affect the poor. In looking at the U.N. development agenda, from the first development decade to the millennium development goals and sustainable development goals, we can see a tension between economic growth and eradication of poverty. Over time, a shift in focus has occurred towards placing the poor at the center of development policy. By focusing on the poor and poverty eradication, development policy becomes more about human flourishing, which, ironically, produces higher levels of growth in developing countries. It does, however, lower the growth rate of developed countries, as it reduces their privileged position.

TI TRIPLE HELIX NETWORKS IN A MULTICULTURAL CONTEXT: TRIGGERS AND BARRIERS
   FOR FOSTERING GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB This article deals with Triple Helix (university, industry and government cooperation) from an institutional theory perspective. The empirical context is the Western Cape Region in South Africa and the focus is entrepreneurship development. The purpose is two-fold: first, the existing Triple Helix model is adapted to the South African context; and second, facilities and impediments for working according to Triple Helix in South Africa are identified. The empirical material consists of a survey and three longitudinal case studies illustrating the degree of cooperation between the three parties. The article contributes to knowledge about how the Triple Helix model works on a regional level in a developing country. The study draws the following conclusions: when cooperation is to be identified between the three actors, only two of the three are involved; one missing link in the Triple Helix model is the focus on the entrepreneur; cooperation between the three parties are incidental rather than planned and there is lack of structure. In turn, some of these conclusions may be an effect of institutional changes on a national level. For a normative legacy, the article proposes a set of suggestions for incorporating all relevant parties on a practical level.

TI Urban waste management and the mobile challenge
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Digital evolution and mobile developments are carving a new era that affects human behaviour and global governance. Interconnectivity and flow of information through various types of modern means create new opportunities for cooperation and ways to work. Waste management could not stay unaffected by these changes. New potentials are arising for the sector, offering a novel field for innovation, changing the way waste practices are applied. In this framework, mobile products and apps can become valuable tools for authorities, companies, civilians and other stakeholders, integrating these technologies in the battle for environmental protection, recycling, etc. This article examines the unexplored challenges of mobile apps to deliver sustainable waste management with emphasis on recycling and waste prevention performance, especially for emerging developing countries. It presents the opportunities that are involved in using mobile apps to improve both the systemic performance of a specific waste management system and the individual behaviour of the users. Furthermore, the article reviews the most important relevant literature and summarises the key findings of the recent research on mobile apps and human behaviour. Useful conclusions are drawn for both the content and the format of the mobile apps required for recycling and waste prevention. Finally, the article presents the most characteristic mobile apps that are already in place in the waste management sector.

TI Comparative Analysis of Low-Cost Housing Policies in Malaysia and
   Nigeria
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED
   SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB The dearth of low-cost housing (LCH) provision in Nigeria calls for urgent attention and Malaysia as a fast-growing developing country mitigated a similar encumbrance, hence the need to review the LCH policies of the two countries. This will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that were adopted by the Malaysian Government and suggest same to Nigerian Government with a view to mitigating homelessness in Nigerian cities. Drawing a systematic review of published literature, this paper reveals that Malaysian Government role in LCH provision is encouraging, although there are still some lacunas; already receiving the necessary attention by the stakeholders concerned. This paper reveals that the Malaysian LCH policies created opportunities for the poor, and therefore promote pro-poor growth to have a home while the Nigerian government policies encouraged inequality and enhance high disparities in access to financial credit for housing purpose by the low-income earners (LIEs) due to lack of framework and institutional failure. The paper conclude that LCH policies and programmes should be sustainable economically; socially acceptable, and technically feasible. In addition, the policies and programmes should enhance cooperation; consultation, sharing knowledge within the stakeholders and ensure that the LIEs can gain access to homes.

AB This research, entitled Protohabitat, deals with the arrangement of a neighborhood prototype planned according to criteria of environmental, social, economic and cultural sustainability in developing countries. Such a neighborhood integrates, on one hand, an experimental prototype of incremental housing built with improved traditional materials and systems of construction and, on the other hand, the use of new technologies. This article presents the proposal developed for the city of Manta (Ecuador), which is implementing fairly well some urban models and building typologies foreign to their social, environmental, and cultural conditions. Backed by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (Aecid, Spanish acronym) and based on a holistic vision, this work has integrated all the habitat levels, from the urban to the constructive development, starting from the specific socio-spatial considerations in the place but also including those parameters already assumed, tested and commonly accepted by the best urban culture.

The results of a primary research conducted in Talcahuano, one of the worst affected cities by the disaster (through methods of semi-structured interviews, observation, documentary review and social media) show that communities have the power to activate internal resilience capacities to cope with and recover from natural disasters. For instance, the role of social networks, organisation, cooperation, trust, local knowledge, and participation was crucial at all stages of the disaster. The study highlights that communities are not simply passive victims of disasters; rather, they are active agents. The lessons from the 2010 Chile earthquake and tsunami can become a useful operational tool for managing efficiently emergency situations in vulnerable communities and planning effective and sustainable disaster risk reduction policies in developing countries.

TI Evaluating issues and outcomes associated with public-private
   partnership housing project delivery: Tanzanian practitioners'
   preliminary observations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are being viewed as the next best alternative procurement option in the construction sector, particularly in developing countries such as Tanzania. This preliminary study aims to investigate the following aspects of PPP (PPPH) housing project delivery: (1) cost and affordability; (2) the influence of sustainability factors; and (3) the associated benefits which, despite the plethora of PPP-related studies, few have specifically examined. To achieve these objectives, a questionnaire survey was conducted with 28 stakeholders from Tanzania. Frequency analysis and one-sample t-tests were used to rank and identify the significant factors and outcomes of HPPP adoption. The most critical cost and affordability factors were that PPP procurement: (1) is economical compared to traditional methods; (2) offers value for money; and (3) can facilitate affordable housing supply outcomes. The major sustainability factors were beginning sustainability assessment from the feasibility stage and considering sustainability in project viability evaluation. Encouraging private sector innovation and management skills, risk sharing and value for money were found to be among HPPP delivery benefits. These findings provide insights for PPP policy and practitioners in understanding the significant factors in PPPH delivery.

TI A fair and progressive carbon price for a sustainable economy
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The principle of "common but differentiated responsibility", as a key concept of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), acknowledges the conditions for a generally acceptable and differentiated pricing mechanism on carbon emissions. With reference to this principle, carbon price determination has become a necessary instrument for sustainable policies. Considering the development gaps and the historical responsibility of the OECD's countries, a single carbon price would raise a major issue of equity between "developed" and "developing" countries. Although from a climate perspective each molecule of CO2 produces the same level of damage despite the nature or the location of the activity generating the emissions, all CO2 emissions are not on an equal footing. Indeed, some are necessary to improve the lives of people in "developing" countries when others can be considered not indispensable, especially beyond a certain level of development. In this policy paper, we explain how the price of carbon should be fixed according to a reference price depending on the Human Development Index (HDI) and CO2 emissions per capita.
   The HDI criterion enables to integrate progressivity into taxation while distinguishing what is essential from what is not. By taking a reference price based on the HDI, countries with low HDIs should pay a lower carbon price. However, with same HDI levels, countries with higher CO2 emissions should pay a penalty on the reference price.
   Our policy paper analyses the benefits of a differentiated and progressive carbon pricing mechanism to facilitate intergovernmental cooperation for a more sustainable economy.

AB Global warming has seriously affected the survival of mankind and the sustainable development of society. All countries in the world have taken measures to deal with the problem, and formed a series of effective international cooperation mechanism. China's government actively respond to global warming, and participate and cooperate as a developing country. China's government established the national climate change countermeasures coordination mechanism. Furthermore, according to the national strategy of sustainable development requirements, China's government has adopted a series of related policies and measures to deal with climate change. Targets for reducing carbon emissions are very arduous and long-term. The achievement of this goal and environmental protection and economic interests of the organization are a paradox. In the process of reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate warming, China's government needs to further enhance the ability of service, to strengthen the rule of law, to strengthen the sense of responsibility, and to improve work efficiency. China's government is actively playing planning, guiding and participatory role, in order to control global warming.

SO BRQ-BUSINESS RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a fundamental role in advancing the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs), as they enable cities and communities to reach large-scale solutions. In this article, we analyze 348 MNEs' sustainability reports with explicit reference to the SDGs to identify the different roles that MNEs play in advancing the SDGs at the local level. Through qualitative content analysis, the literature on MNEs' roles was validated, extended, and two new roles were found. The five roles of MNEs in local sustainable development that were validated are financer, community capacity builder, product and service provider, partner, and innovator. The three that were extended are employee developer, supply chains and procurement developer, and program deliver, while the two new additions are consultant and awareness raiser. The results of bivariate analyses show that some MNE roles are correlated to headquarter region and the industry sector. The 10 roles are also relevant for implementing all 17 SDGs and 102 of the 169 SDG targets. JEL CLASSIFICATION: M14

TI Bleeding Bodies, Untrustworthy Bodies: A Social Constructionist Approach
   to Health and Wellbeing of Young People in Kenya
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The Sustainable Development Goals provide a global development agenda that is meant to be inclusive of all people. However, the development needs for vulnerable populations such as youth are not reflected within the policy agenda of some developing countries. One of the reasons for this is that research that explores health and wellbeing concerns for young people are sparse in the region and where they exist, the focus has been on marginalized subgroups. To address this gap, this cross-sectional study explored the health and wellbeing of youth in Kenya. We conducted 10 focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews with youth ages 15 to 24 years. A thematic analysis of the data revealed that structural factors are important influencers of youth perceptions and their social constructions of health and wellbeing. Kenyan youth are concerned about the health status and healthcare services in their communities, as well as issues of community trust of youths and perceived risks of political misuse and emotional suffering. Our findings suggest that youth transitioning into adulthood in resource-constrained areas experience feelings of powerlessness and inability to take charge over their own life. This impacts how they perceive and socially construct health and wellbeing.

AB The dwindling nature of overseas development assistance in the early part of the 1990s called for the establishment of capital markets in some African countries, including Ghana, with the view to increasing foreign direct investments and achieving sustainable inflows, growth and development. One important factor which affects the determination of prices and the growth of capital markets is macroeconomic risk which is quite high in developing countries. Following works done on advanced stock markets, this study seeks to investigate the impact of six macroeconomic risk factors on asset pricing in the various industrial classification-financial, manufacturing, food and beverages, distribution and mining under the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) for the period January 1997 to December 2002. Using the arbitrage pricing methodology developed by Ross (1976) and Chen et al. (1986), the study revealed that investors in Ghana considered three main macroeconomic risk factors-short-term interest rate risk, inflation risk and the term structure of the country's interest rate in the determination of the various industrial asset prices during the period under consideration. Analysis of the risks and returns profile of the industries also shows that financial assets made the best gains on the market. Both general and specific policy recommendations aimed at improving the performance of the GSE are explored.

AB In many developing countries, multinational enterprises (MNEs) in mining operate alongside fast-growing communities of informal artisanal, small-scale miners. This has led to direct conflict and competition for mineral resources. This paper introduces the Salience and Institutional Analysis and Design framework as a means to analyze the MNE strategies used to address informal miners across different governance levels in the gold mining sector of Ghana and discusses the implications of these strategies for sustainability. We identify the emergence of a cooperative strategy with informal miners as a sustainable alternative to the political strategy of reliance on the state to protect tenure.

TI Viable Alternatives for Large-Scale Unsustainable Projects in Developing
   Countries: The case of the Kumtor gold mine in Kyrgyzstan
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Resource extraction often precludes sustainable forms of land use and poses long-term threats, and yet it is promoted as a development opportunity for poor countries. This is illustrated by a case study of the Kumtor gold mine in Kyrgyzstan. Compared with a large gold mine, most alternative activities, such as tourism, trophy hunting, cottage industry and pastoralism, can only generate negligible benefits. Other, potentially much more important, sources of income for poor countries are payments for ecosystem services taking the form of compensation preventing unsustainable forms of land use. The discussion focuses on how these could be organized to provide viable alternatives to mining. It is concluded that such systems need to be arranged at the international level and to complement the current international cooperation (aid) regime. In Central Asia, reviving the regional water management system would be an important first step in this direction. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
AB With increased market access and road links to urban centres, settled agriculture in Nepal is becoming transformed into intensified cropping, especially in peri- and semi-urban areas. On a global scale, major driving factors for intensification are: population growth, lack of alternate employment, profit motive, market access, road links, availability of agricultural inputs and organizational cooperation. However, in Nepal the main driving factor is necessity due to lack of other income opportunities. The outcomes of agricultural intensification, namely, improved economic condition of farmers with higher production and good market price are intended to address the developmental challenges of high population growth, food deficit, agricultural trade modalities, fragile ecology, and national policies. In spite of soil fertility loss, erosion, workload and pollution, agricultural intensification is found to be a viable option for better livelihood in developing countries. This review paper discusses the global driving factors of intensification in the local context highlighting their positive and negative impacts.

TI (In)Effective Business Responsibility Engagements in Areas of Limited
   Statehood: Nigeria's Oil Sector as a Case Study
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB In reality, most state actors-especially those in the developing world-are usually incapable of effectively governing all facets of their territory. This has necessitated the intervention of non-state actors (in this instance, corporations), who through their social responsibility engagements act as functional equivalents to state-driven government. Using empirical data, this article evaluates the "governance" interventions of corporations in the oil industry in Nigeria's Delta region. While arguing that the area qualifies as an area of limited statehood, the article asserts that corporate social responsibility practices that are based on Western (neoliberal) approaches cannot contribute effectively to the sustainable development of host-communities. In this context, the article contends that since the social responsibility engagements of corporations in the Niger Delta (as in most developing countries) are influenced by a pro-West philosophy, the end result is a business responsibility engagement which is ineffective as a development strategy.

TI Mapping health workforce development strategies across key global health
   agencies: an assessment of objectives and key interventions
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB The political and financial commitment to addressing the global shortage of health workers is stronger than ever before. Therefore, the global effort to strengthen human resources for health (HRH) must be co-ordinated and aligned to strategically utilize the current momentum and create sustainable impact. This paper assesses HRH strategies to (1) create greater understanding on the collective global action towards improving HRH, and (2) identify opportunities for greater co-ordination to improve sustainable health workforce development. We searched published and grey literature to identify the HRH strategies of select large-scale global health organizations. The most common approaches were increasing the supply of health workers, facilitating training and education and improving health worker management capacities. Overall, our analysis shows there is a need to (1) improve co-ordination among development partners, (2) ensure strong engagement and leadership of national governments and (3) generate scientific evidence on the best approaches for sustainable workforce development.

TI Achieving STOP TB Partnership goals: perspectives on development of new
   diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for tuberculosis
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB Global eradication of tuberculosis (TB) depends on identification and treatment of all active TB cases and of the two billion people who are estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The past decade has seen a renaissance of scientific activities and funder investment into development of new TB drugs, diagnostics, biomarkers and vaccines. This viewpoint critically summarises the promising portfolio of more accurate TB diagnostics, new TB drugs and vaccines that have been endorsed by the STOP TB Partnership. Increasing numbers of Phase 2 and 3 drug, vaccine and diagnostic clinical trials in high-TB endemic areas reflect substantial progress towards attaining Global STOP-TB Partnership targets. Achievement of STOP-TB Partnership goals will crucially depend on political will and serious investment by funders and developing country governments into improving delivery of better health services and living conditions for their people. Long-term sustainability of any newer tools implemented at point of care is essential.

TI Think globally, act locally? Domestic constraints on foreign aid
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Some democratic governments prefer a more ambitious and generous development policy than others. These governments hold stronger preferences for realizing the sustainable development goals defined by the UN, including the eradication of poverty, the right to education, the protection of human rights, and the safeguarding of the environment in developing countries. Yet, the extent to which democratic governments can realize their preferred development policies varies significantly. In this article, I analyze the discrepancies between governments' development policy preferences and the level of official development assistance (ODA) they provide. On the theoretical side, I analyze governments' discretion to increase their level of ODA. Specifically, I argue that unified governments that face weak institutional constraints find it easier to transfer their ambitious development policy preferences into higher levels of ODA. On the empirical side, I study the level of ODA in 33 OECD countries over a period of 23 years. Analyzing speeches at the UN General Assembly, I apply an innovative operationalization of governments' concern for global development. My findings support the argument that governments' discretion in domestic politics facilitates an increase of ODA.

TI Sustainability and development after COVID-19
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Developing countries are highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to the lack of international support for ensuring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet the mounting financial burden faced by all countries means that additional support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future. It is critical that developing countries find innovative policy mechanisms to achieve sustainability and development aims in a cost-effective manner. This requires identifying affordable policies that can yield immediate progress towards several SDGs together and aligns economic incentives for longer term sustainable development. We identify three policies that meet these criteria: a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments and dissemination of renewable energy in rural areas; reallocating irrigation subsidies to improve water supply, sanitation and wastewater infrastructure; and a tropical carbon tax, which is a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions. Such innovative and cost-effective policy mechanisms do not require substantial external support, and they foster greater progress towards achieving the SDGs in poorer economies.

TI An Assessment of Agricultural Export Competitiveness of Commercial
   Crops: Pathways to Augment Indian Agricultural Exports
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Agricultural exports in developing countries significantly impact achieving sustainable development goals targeted at improving agricultural productivity, sustainability, poverty eradication, and employment creation. The pattern of agricultural export competitiveness of India vis-a-vis other Asian agricultural-based countries was assessed during the post-WTO period (2001 to 2019). The Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA) technique was employed using time series data focusing on High-Value Commercial (HVC) crops. As is evident from the RSCA indices for India, a high degree of export competitiveness was witnessed in tobacco, cotton, and spices, whereas it declined in sugarcane, coffee, and tea over the years. The commodities that exhibited strong competitiveness reflected huge potential, whereas commodities such as sugarcane, coffee, and tea experienced erosion in their competitiveness. With the changing priorities of the nation, there is a need for India to redraw future agricultural export scenarios focusing on the production of HVC crops, processing and value chains, and diversification of export baskets while maintaining the sustainability of agro-ecological assets. Nevertheless, agricultural exports had vast potential to drive the economy in developing countries like India. The holistic conclusion advocates an important policy implication for the design of export strategy to augment the export competitiveness of HVC crops and enhance the share of agricultural exports in the context of emerging trends and change commercial facets of Indian agriculture.

TI Food for all in 2020: Can the world be fed without damaging the
   environment?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB Approximately 780 million people world-wide are chronically undernourished, and past gains in food production have been associated with environmental problems, yet global demand for cereals is projected to increase by 56% and for meat by 74% between 1990 and 2020.
   The international Food Policy Research Institute has developed the view that every person in the world can have access to sufficient food to sustain a healthy and productive life, that malnutrition can be abolished, and that food can originate from efficient, effective, and low-cost food systems that are compatible with sustainable use of natural resources. Moreover, IFPRI has concluded that these conditions can be achieved by the year 2020, if the world commits itself to specified changes in behaviour, priorities, and policies. Pn order for these changes to occur, sustained action is needed in six areas: (1) strengthening the capacity of developing-country governments; (2) investing more in poor people; (3) accelerating agricultural productivity; (4) assuring sound management of natural resources; (5) developing competitive markets; and (6) expanding and realigning international development assistance. We have the knowledge and the capacity to meet the food needs of every person without damaging the environment. What is needed is political will and commitment on the part of all members of society to take the required action.

AB Due to self-perpetuating growth of cities, urban population is increasing by 50 million per year in the developing world alone. Inability of authorities to respond adequately and greater autonomy or dweller control in the production of housing, in almost all developing countries, has resulted in informal settlements with poor physical infrastructure, which is an integral part of any sustainable human settlement. These diverse settlements share some attributes for instance, environments are conceived and constructed by the occupants themselves independently, without any professional advice; second occupation and construction frequently take place simultaneously; and these informal settlements are usually taking place in suburban and urban surroundings. Along with reporting on the research which attempted to provide a partial remedy to this situation, this paper indicates possible interventions to upgrade these informal settlements. It requires progressive improvement of infrastructure, new type of settlement master plans, strong commitment and involvement of the communities to be served in the planning, decision-making, implementation and management processes. Different types of interventions can be applied to transform an illegal and substandard environment into an acceptable and liveable place. International support and collaboration undoubtedly play a significant role in mainstreaming these low-income settlements in the developing world through technical and capital intensive interventions. Informal settlements constitute extremely complex environments, and for an intervention to be successful, it has to be able to deal with this complexity and should be based upon good precedent and strong theoretical foundations.

TI Brazil as a new international cooperation actor in sub-Saharan Africa:
   Biofuels at the crossroads between sustainable development and natural
   resource exploitation
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Over the last decade, emerging economic powers have become increasingly influential actors in the formerly closed circle of donor countries. In the frame of south-south cooperation initiatives, large economies in the global south are working with less advanced developing countries. While a significant literature on China's role regarding mining and oil and gas exploration in Africa has developed, an analysis of the new dynamics of South-South cooperation and its effect on the political economy and sustainability of rural development and energy diversification in African countries is largely absent. As an effort to start filling this gap, we analyze the opportunities and frictions introduced by Brazilian actors in the biofuel sector in a set of sub-Saharan African countries. By assessing the political, technical and economic dimensions present in Brazil's south-south cooperation strategy for this region, we find that the arrival of Brazilian biofuel actors to Africa is leading to deep asymmetries between powerful and less preeminent actors, undermining the overall sustainability of the offered development model.

TI Product Stewardship Strategy: A Study of Indian Firms
SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Product stewardship strategy (PSS) implementation creates differentiation' advantage for a firm. This paper presents a definition and measure of PSS. Based on an empirical analysis of 60 Indian firms known for their corporate citizenship behavior, it presents important features of PSS in a developing country like India. Results show that the firms are focusing on known, salient, and powerful stakeholders to run their existing business and are relatively less proactive in identifying new sets of stakeholders who might be critical in unknown circumstances. Firms are collaborating with upstream and downstream supply chain partners to design eco-efficient products, and promoting their transformation toward sustainability with effective marketing and advertising campaigns. The firms are relatively more responsive than transparent so that they can balance the interests of all stakeholders. However, the firms are lagging in their commitment to go beyond regulatory norms. Further, the paper discusses some important managerial implications. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING
   SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable development and poverty eradication are global challenges that require a systematic, transformative approach for action on the ground, with enhanced environmental impact assessment (EIA) at its core. Traditional EIA has been criticised for being a top-down regulatory method biased in favour of the sponsor of a development action. The purposes of this paper are to describe how to transform EIA into a process that enables sustainable development and poverty eradication, and to stimulate much-needed dialogue among engineers, scientists and policy makers. The paper argues for the synthesis of four components to create a new approach: (a) an adaptive social learning process at the core for multi-stakeholder assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring; (b) a trans-disciplinary, knowledge-partnership, systems-based approach to assessment that identifies priority problems and drivers using risk and vulnerability theory; (c) multi-criteria sustainability assessment of alternative solutions that makes socio-political, cultural, economic and ecological trade-offs transparent; and (d) integrated capacity building to sustain the target solution. Deductive reasoning based on empirical evidence from case studies and a literature review supports the argument.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB Electric vehicle technology is a crucial technology for achieving sustainable energy transformation, which is of great significance to climate change and promotes sustainable development. This paper attempts to study the transnational R&D cooperation of electric vehicles. According to the authorized data of transnational co-patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), a social network analysis method is employed, and a detailed study of transnational co-patent networks in electric vehicles is conducted, including the construction of network, the analysis of nationality distribution of co-patent inventors, the analysis of structural characteristics and important nodes of network in different stages from the perspective of inventors and countries. The research results show that the cooperative groups formed by inventors are independent of each other and have not yet formed a large network; the degree of transnational cooperation in developed countries far exceeds that in developing countries; the US and Germany are the dual-core in the transnational co-patent networks; the breadth and intensity of transnational cooperation are strengthening, and the regional borders are less and less restrictive. As for the existing problems, authoritative inventors could organize large international R&D cooperation institutions to gather dispersed inventors together and connect them into a large inventors' network; developing countries are encouraged to seek partners through the network, actively participate in transnational R&D cooperation, and developed countries are encouraged to hold global technological innovation events.

   overview of the key role played by the SWMCN Subprogramme of the Joint
   FAO/IAEA Division over the last 20 years
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), through the Joint Division with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, assists its Member States in applying nuclear techniques to alleviate challenges in food safety, food security and sustainable agricultural development. The Soil and Water Management & Crop Nutrition (SWMCN) Subprogramme, within the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, has made significant contributions to the development of isotopic techniques for the assessment of soil degradation and the development of efficient soil and land conservation approaches. These techniques include fallout radionuclides such as Cs-137, Pb-210(ex), Be-7, and Pu239+240 as well as C-13 stable isotope and compound-specific stable isotope analyses. These methodologies were developed and/or refined through the work of researchers from developed and developing countries who were selected to work within the frame of IAEA's Coordinated Research Projects (CRPs). Internal research activities implemented in the Joint FAO/IAEA's SWMCN Laboratory in Seibersdorf supported the work accomplished in the CRPs.
   The methodologies thus developed have been subsequently disseminated to developing countries by IAEA's Technical Cooperation Programme to assist Member States to adopt climate-smart agriculture and reduce soil degradation that poses a threat to food security and the environment. This review paper provides an overview of the activities conducted in the frame of CRPs for combating soil erosion over the last 20 years and highlights the major achievements. Examples of the success and the impact obtained in Morocco, Madagascar, and Vietnam in using these isotopic techniques are presented.

Simultaneously, the WHO neglected tropical disease (NTD) roadmap 2021-2030 calls for increased country ownership and domestically financed NTD programmes. Focusing on Liberia and blending primary research from the COUNTDOWN consortium and personal programmatic experience, this commentary reflects on the sustainability and financing of NTD programme delivery within the current context. We explore the successes and challenges of current models of collaboration and opportunities to improve country ownership and sustainability.

SO CLEANER LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
AB The negative impact of mining activities on mining communities has received increased calls for mining firms to engage in management practices that are deemed to be environmentally friendly. Using the ecological modernisation theory, the study sought to examine which of the environmentally accepted supply chain management practices should be encouraged to ensure that mining firms are able to sustain their performance economically, socially and environmentally. The current study, therefore, used the explanatory study design to gather primary data from 200 respondents. Data were analysed by means of PLS-SEM to model the relationship between green supply chain management practices and sustainable performance. The findings of the study indicated that all the four constructs of sustainable supply chain management practices predict the sustainable performance of mining firms. The study, therefore, recommends the adoption of green supply chain management practices by mining firms in order to sustain their performance. Details of the findings are discussed.

AB Tourism is an activity that can have a truly major impact on sustainable development. EU recorded in excess of 440m visitor arrivals in 2005. Tourism, directly and indirectly, accounts for around 10% of European GDP and 20m jobs. Europeans account for over half of all international travel, and visits by Europeans provide an important source of income for many developing countries. In 2005 the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) identified an agenda of 12 aims for sustainable tourism. The EU Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) has three key objectives: Economic prosperity, Social equity and cohesion and Environmental protection. Tourism businesses could function properly under the sustainability model and they have mentioned "environmental education programmes" and "establishment of co-operation and partnerships among local, regional and state stakeholders and authorities" as the most sustainable actions. The standard is and must be applicable to any organization that wishes to (a) Increase the environmental responsibility of tourism enterprises, (b) Increase the capacity of local administration on monitoring sustainable tourism, (c) Create a transactional network of shared planning and management policies for sustainable tourism, (d) Exchange best practices and knowledge in the field of sustainable tourism. This paper briefly describes the general requirements of MESST.

   Findings - Findings range from the importance of an existing and suitable institutional framework, through the reduction of start-up costs and the cash- flow problems of these small companies, to the definition of a sustainable model (fee for service) and the provision of accompanying services (gas, water, telephone, etc.) and capacity building.
   Research limitations/ implications - Further research will be determined following monitoring and evaluation feedback from these local companies.
   Practical implications - Working in countries with suitable institutional frameworks and with grant financing to cover most of initial equipment investment to keep tariffs low. Establishing local business zones with higher power levels to encourage local economic development. Ensuring maximum equipment efficiency (particularly batteries).
   Originality/value - Identification of a sustainable model in rural electrification that is now being replicated on a major scale in Morocco and South Africa.

TI Sustainable waste management in Africa through CDM projects
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Only few Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects (traditionally focussed on landfill gas combustion) have been registered in Africa if compared to similar developing countries. The waste hierarchy adopted by many African countries clearly shows that waste recycling and composting projects are generally the most sustainable. This paper undertakes a sustainability assessment for practical waste treatment and disposal scenarios for Africa and makes recommendations for consideration. The appraisal in this paper demonstrates that mechanical biological treatment of waste becomes more financially attractive if established through the CDM process. Waste will continue to be dumped in Africa with increasing greenhouse gas emissions produced, unless industrialised countries (Annex 1) fund carbon emission reduction schemes through a replacement to the Kyoto Protocol. Such a replacement should calculate all of the direct and indirect carbon emission savings and seek to promote public-private partnerships through a concerted support of the informal sector.

   DEVELOPPEMENT
AB In recent years, partnership in development assistance has received a great deal of attention. This paper evaluates an alternative form of partnership, a business-NGO partnership, that provides rural people with access to telecommunications in Bangladesh. Despite market liberalization, the traditional provision mechanisms may not provide universal access to people living in rural areas of developing countries. Attainment of universal access, therefore, may require alternative institutions. Based on three criteria of universal service provision nondiscriminatory access, uniform pricing, and quality restrictions - this study finds that the business-NGO partnership complies with the first two criteria. In addition, the partnership ensures economic sustainability for both the business and the NGO.

TI Community Participation Strategy for Sustainable Urban Regeneration in
   Xiamen, China
SO LAND
AB Urban regeneration is an important strategic choice in promoting urban development globally. Existing research on urban regeneration mainly focuses on the community's economic benefits. However, less research concentrates on how community participation contributes to the sustainable development of communities. The aim of this study is to explore the community regeneration approach in the context of urban regeneration in a typical village community in China. This study finds that participatory planning, which is mainly characterized by public participation, can be an effective way of communication and cooperation. The collaborative workshops provide a participatory platform for stakeholders and promote sustainable community development. Therefore, traditional planning approaches may need to be changed. The contribution of this article is to develop a collaborative planning approach for sustainable community development, which can serve as a reference for community governance in China and other developing countries.

TI The Shisong Cardiac Center in Cameroon: An Example of a Long-Term
   Collaboration/Cooperation Toward Autonomy
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are present in nearly 1% of live births; according to WHO, there are 1. 5 million newborns affected by CHD per year and more than 4 million children waiting for cardiac surgery treatment worldwide. The majority of these children (similar to 90%) could be treated, saved and subsequently have a good quality of life but unfortunately, in developing countries with a suboptimal care or no access to care, they are destined to die. Cameroon, one of the 40 poorest countries in the world, is a typical example of this dramatic scenario and this is why we started a collaboration project with a local religious partner (Tertiary Sisters of Saint Francis) in 2001 with the aim of establishing the first cardiac surgery center in this country. There are various well-known organizational models to start a cooperation project in pediatric cardiac surgery in a developing country. In our case, the project included a long-term collaboration with a stable local partner, a big financial investment and a long period of development (10 years or more). It is probably the most difficult model but it is the only one with the greatest guarantee of success in terms of sustainability and autonomy. The aim of this study is to analyze the constructive and problematic aspects of the 17-year collaboration in this project, and to assess possible solutions regarding its critical issues. Although much has been done during this 17-year we are aware that there is still a lot that needs to be done.

TI An extended model of school-university partnership for professional
   development: bridging universities' theoretical knowledge and teachers'
   practical knowledge
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR TEACHING
AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education has recently driven more outreach teacher professional development (PD) programmes. While research evidence shows the importance of school-university partnerships for effective PD programmes, this research area remains under-investigated in many developing countries, including Malaysia. This qualitative study investigated the experiences and perspectives of 40 primary school teachers who participated in a three-phase, school-university PD programme. Phase 1 emphasised reflective pedagogy and co-development of teaching interventions. Phase 2 focused on classroom teaching intervention and continuous feedback on teaching methods, whereas Phase 3 consisted of interview sessions. Guided by the 'Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growth', an extended version of the model was developed to include an emerging domain; the Initial Positive Perception Domain. This domain addresses teachers' voluntary involvement and their clear intention to collaborate with the university researchers. Most importantly, this domain facilitates positive interaction between the existing domains in the model by promoting teachers' reflective pedagogical practice and strengthening the collective learning community. This study provides explicit evidence that a teacher's initial positive perception towards school-university partnership serves as a fundamental bridge between theoretical k nowledge and practical knowledge for developing highly effective PD programmes.

We will argue in this paper that it is helpful to conceptualize designing for sustainable IT-based solutions as taking place in a multi-dimensional space. It requires thinking about how a project is framed; the perspectives and commitments of the project partners; the type of innovation that is foregrounded; the motivations and needs of the user group; and the level of sustainability a project or research program may achieve. The paper describes some of the challenges and possible solutions by revisiting a portfolio of projects that developed IT support for elderly people who continue living in their own homes.

TI Provision of extended producer responsibility system for products
   packaging: A case study of Iran
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB A powerful legal tool in evolving solid waste management (SWM) systems is extended producer responsibility (EPR). It is a mechanism that shifts the responsibility of a product to manufacturers/importers at the 'end-of-life' stage. Yet, implementation of the EPR concept has faced difficulties in developing countries. In Iran, as one such country, the principle of EPR system was issued in executive regulation of SWM in 2005, however, so far, it has been limited to a voluntary scheme. The problem merits further investigation. Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the obstacles in the path of developing EPR system for product packaging. The research examines the current SWM systems in four functional classified frameworks: legal, institutional, financial and technical. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the system are elaborated through semi-structured interviews with a senior executive in the Ministry of Interior (MoI). Then, viable methods to increase resource efficiency and sustainable waste treatment are suggested. The change in the financing mechanism in the Budget Law 2020 forces the manufacturers/importers of products containing recyclable components to pay the revenue from one in 1000 products to MoI for developing recycling facilities and incinerators through partnerships with the private sector. This new strategy would promote proper management of product packaging, create more jobs and a market for international cooperation. However, poor source-separation of wet/dry waste, informal sector activities, exclusive focus on the economic aspect of waste management, lack of expertise and public awareness campaigns are the barriers in this regard.

TI Lessons from the World Bank?s solar home system-based rural
   electrification projects (2000-2020): Policy implications for meeting
   Sustainable Development Goal 7 by 2030
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB The main objective of this review paper is to examine the lessons learnt from 16 solar home system (SHS)-based World Bank projects implemented between 2000 and 2020 in the remote rural areas of developing countries. This study emphasises the role of SHS as a technology option in providing electricity to the remaining 10% of the world's population without access to electricity. This study identifies three major internal factors and two external factors that may affect the successful implementation. The internal factors that emerge within the project and arise primarily during its design and implementation include financial barriers (barriers on subsidies and investment support, risk management and commercial viability, credit services and support, and partnerships with the local banking sector and micro-finance institutions), technical barriers (barriers on effective operation, maintenance and after-sales technical service, qualified technical entities and professionals, product quality assurance and monitoring, and the availability and feasibility of other complementary energy technology applications) and project design and implementation barriers (barriers on the monitoring, evaluation and sustainability of the project, the development of local capacity, and clearly defined project objectives). The external factors that have emerged outside the project and are already existing in the societal context include political and institutional barriers (barriers on the institutional framework and its sustainability, and political support and commitment from the community and local political leaders) and social and cultural barriers (barriers on building trust, relationships, confidence and partnerships among stakeholders, the sociocultural perceptions of SHSs, maintaining ongoing dialogues, coordination and cooperation among stakeholders, and adapting to changing international and local conditions). Subsequently, this study considers policy implications that are valuable for the current and upcoming challenges of rural electrification in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 - electricity for all - by 2030.

The Programme is vastly distributed, at least three different countries and hence three different higher academic institutions will be involved in its execution for each student, as well as very open - it has many entry points, namely background areas it admits students from. The need for cross-fertilization between various areas that either affect or are the effects from ICT, and possibility of feedback between developed and developed countries based on cooperation that leads to stable and sustainable civic society, makes this intrepid programme in many ways a unique education endeavour.

AB Lack of action on cross-border environmental problems in developing countries is often ascribed to gaps in local capacity and resources, failure of regional cooperation and lack of financial support from rich countries. Using the case of the Southeast Asian Haze pollution from forest and peat fires in Indonesia, we explore the challenges posed by environmental problems whose causes are closely linked to local development and livelihood strategies, and whose impacts are local, regional (haze) as well as global (carbon emissions). We assess whether there are real opportunities to implement effectively the recent Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. To address the deep determinants behind haze pollution, we propose signatories to the Agreement refocus their efforts to controlling peat fires rather than to strive for a zero-burning regime. We also recommend a new approach to financing sustainable development based on rules and incentives, with a regional pool of funds, contributed by rich countries through the Global Environment Facility and countries in Southeast Asia.

TI Analysis of the potential of small-scale enterprises of artisans and
   sawyers as instruments for sustainable forest management in Puerto Rico
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB Small-scale forest enterprises have been recognized as a potential instrument for sustainable development. In particular, the production of handicrafts is a major form of cultural expression and a significant source of income in several developing countries. In this study, we characterize the local handicraft sector in Puerto Rico to identify essential elements for fostering small-scale forest enterprises. Artisans and sawyers were home-based microenterprises that harvested, processed, and traded a wide variety of local forest products, including 125 types of wood and several non-wood forest products. Nonetheless, severe competition from cheaper imported crafts, low demand, and high product variability hamper the development of the local handicraft sector. Despite globalization, sawyers and artisans in Puerto Rico, as part of the U.S., have access to the largest markets of tropical woods and home accessories in the world. But, to participate in these markets, they must increase competitiveness. Lack of institutional effectiveness is a major constraint for the success of the artisan development program in Puerto Rico. Therefore, cooperation and linkages between all support organizations, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and associations of artisans, need to be enhanced to provide effective technical assistance, marketing, and financial services to artisans.

AB Sustainable transport systems meet all the main principles of sustainable development: protection of public health and environmental quality, respect of the ecosystems, limitation of emissions, sustainable use of renewable resources and minimum use of non-renewable resources. In the framework of this paper, the international trends and policies concerning sustainable transport systems are presented and discussed. The international organisations, which set these policies, are also presented. More specifically, the O.E.C.D. (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) guidelines towards environmentally sustainable transport are considered to be very important. In addition, the European Community moves towards the implementation of a common transport policy facing two basic issues: breaking the link between economic growth and transport growth and achieving equal growth of all transport modes. Moreover, the E.C.M.T. (European Conference of Ministers of Transport) tries to create an integrated transport system through member countries and the rest of the continent by analysing environmental, social and traffic policy issues. Furthermore, the role of World Bank is considered to be very important in obtaining transport social sustainability, as it contributes to the creation of essential transport infrastructure in developing countries. Finally, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (W.B.C.S.D.) started in 2002 the Sustainable Mobility Project, in order to set the goals of a sustainable transport system.

TI Impact of Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy on EKC in SAARC Countries:
   Augmented Mean Group Approach
SO ENERGIES
AB This study looks at the short- and long-term effects of fossil fuels, renewable energy, and nuclear energy on CO2 emissions in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries from 1982 to 2021. We assess the impacts of SAARC's current and anticipated use of nuclear, fossil, and alternative energies by testing the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study applied the second-generation unit root test, cointegration test, and the newly introduced AMG technique to handle the presence of cross-sectional dependence. The results indicate that EKC does not hold in SAARC, and a U-shaped quadratic link exists between GDP and environmental pollution. The findings also reveal that the environmental pollution in the SAARC is caused by fossil fuel, whereas using renewable (REN) and nuclear energy can cut long-term pollution. While renewable energy is critical to minimizing environmental deterioration in SAARC, empirical findings also show that more than rising national wealth is needed to meet environmental demands.

TI International R&D Spillovers and Innovation Efficiency
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The objective of this study is to examine the impact of international research and development (R&D) spillovers on innovation efficiency of specific R&D outcomes, employing the country-level panel data for 44 countries in the 1996-2013 period. Fully considering the heterogeneity of different R&D outputs, scientific papers, PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patents, US patents, and domestic patents are observed separately, which enriches the angles of measuring international R&D spillovers. By applying a stochastic frontier analysis to knowledge production function, we find that foreign R&D capital stock positively contributes to the innovation efficiency of scientific papers, but suppresses the productivity of domestic patents, whereas it does not really matter for PCT or US patents. These results are robust to control for a set of institutional factors and also in sensitivity analyses. Hence, dependence on international R&D spillovers seems neither to be the right way for emerging economies to catch up, nor to be a sustainable model for developing countries to fill the technical gap. Local R&D capital stock, instead, keeps an essential contributor to all four R&D outputs, so raising internal R&D expenditure is actually the key to improving innovation level and sustainable development ability.

TI Reshaping energy policy based on social and human dimensions: an
   analysis of human-building interactions among societies in transition in
   GCC countries
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB Without major structural changes, social sciences can potentially bolster economic diversification and strategic planning efforts in developing countries. This article presents an analysis of a set of human-oriented dimensions to enhance energy policies associated with the building sector in developing countries with similarities to the Gulf Cooperation Council union (GCC). A clear understanding of human dimensions in the GCC union's energy policy is crucial due to social complexities and large numbers of expatriate communities and migrant workers with unknown cultural, behavioral, and financial diversities with respect to local communities. This study evaluates the correlations of demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral dimensions with human-building interactions to identify the main contributors that create discrepancies in human habits, well-being, motivations, responsibilities, and energy use based on a sample of 2200 respondents in Qatar. Moreover, this study is extended to explore human indoor comfort perception dependencies with building features. Behavioral associations with financial drivers, including energy subsidies and demand response programs, are investigated. The patterns in the data are analyzed and attributed to applications in energy policy concerning awareness, social well-being, and interventions. The sample is clustered into various consumer classes, and a feature importance analysis is conducted via machine learning methods to find the key contributors to consumer behavior. The outcomes show profound insight into how human factors influence consumption, consequence awareness, self-responsibility, habits, norms, and comfort perception in residential and work environments. The findings of this study can assist decision-makers in creating targeted strategies to enhance the efficacy of energy policies and improve sustainability performance indicators.

TI Driving force or forced transition? The role of development cooperation
   in promoting energy transitions in the Philippines and Morocco
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper contributes to the understanding of transitions towards low carbon societies in the developing world. While adding extensive empirical insights from the status of energy transitions in two countries faced with major energy challenges, the Philippines and Morocco, our contribution enquires what role external actors like international donors in general, and Germany in particular, can play in such transitions. Based on extensive semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews with energy sector stakeholders in the Philippines and Morocco, this article elucidates the opportunities and barriers of supporting and incentivizing energy transitions in developing countries through development cooperation. Taking transition management as an analytical framework to highlight links between niche level experiments and the electricity regime, this study reveals that donors cannot force an energy transition, but can be a driving force for testing alternative ways for electricity supply through niche level experiments and regime level interventions that are closely connected to the country's primary energy objectives. Multi-stakeholder coordination, a clearer linkage between niche level projects and regime changing effects, and a better understanding of a country's energy transition objectives are promising approaches to increase the likelihood of development cooperation positively affecting a regime level shift in the electricity system.

TI What drives the success of reforestation projects in tropical developing
   countries? The case of the Philippines
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.

TI Coordinated development of green finance and green technology innovation
   in China: from the perspective of network characteristics and prediction
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Under the path of sustainable development, the key to achieving green and low-carbon transformation lies in green technology innovation (GTI), and how to effectively coordinate the relationship between green finance (GF) and GTI is an issue worth studying. This paper constructed an evaluation system of GF and GTI and combined them with the coupled coordination degree model to explore their coordination of Chinese provinces from 2012 to 2019. Then, the core network evolution and spatial structure characteristics of GTI and GF were studied using the modified gravity model. Finally, based on the link prediction, the general future network prediction is made to provide guidance and direction for the future GTI and GF development and construction. The results found that the coordination level between GF and GTI has been continuously improved from 0.356 to 0.436. The core network structure is keeping changing with their connection becoming more complex, and there is still room for optimization. Network centrality characteristics show that the spatial spillover effects are stronger in the more economically developed regions. The overall network possibility prediction shows the potential network connections in different urban agglomerations. This paper provides a certain reference role for China and developing countries to predict the GF and GTI cooperation network development in the future.

TI Improving technology transfer through national systems of innovation:
   climate relevant innovation-system builders (CRIBs)
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB The Technology Executive Committee (TEC) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recently convened a workshop seeking to understand how strengthening national systems of innovation (NSIs) might help to foster the transfer of climate technologies to developing countries. This article reviews insights from the literatures on Innovation Studies and Socio-Technical Transitions to demonstrate why this focus on fostering innovation systems has potential to be more transformative as an international policy mechanism for climate technology transfer than anything the UNFCCC has considered to date. Based on insights from empirical research, the article also articulates how the existing architecture of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism could be usefully extended by supporting the establishment of CRIBs (climate relevant innovation-system builders) in developing countries - key institutions focused on nurturing the climate-relevant innovation systems and building technological capabilities that form the bedrock of transformative, climate-compatible technological change and development.Policy relevanceThis article makes a direct contribution to current work by the TEC of the UNFCCC on enhancing enabling environments for and addressing barriers to technology development and transfer (specifically, it will contribute to Activity 4.3 of the TEC's 2014-15 rolling workplan Further work on enablers and barriers, taking into account the outcomes of the workshop on NSIs'). The article articulates both the conceptual basis that justifies a focus on NSIs in relation to climate technology transfer and makes concrete recommendations as to how this can be implemented under the Convention as a Party-driven extension to the existing architecture of the Technology Mechanism.

AB It's not easy; the current local community really is that climate change and associated disasters are becoming more intense, unpredictable, frequent and costly impacting on rural and urban areas. How can we help communities? Many rural communities, particularly in low income countries and their local governments, residents and small to medium business enterprises (SMEs), find in the context of climate change adaptation that shifting towards Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) difficult. Local governments in rural areas particularly in developing countries and SMEs are often exposed and cannot better protect and prepare themselves. However, there are many resilient rural communities, farmers, businesses and good tools and examples where more public-private sector partnerships can help local government and business shift to DRR.

TI The 2 degrees C scenario - A sustainable world energy perspective
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB A target-oriented scenario of future energy demand and supply is developed in a backcasting process. The main target is to reduce global CO2 emissions to around 10 Gt/a in 2050, thus limiting global average temperature increase to 2 degrees C and preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. A 10-region energy system model is used for simulating global energy supply strategies. A review of sector and region-specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The 2 degrees C scenario shows that renewable energy could provide as much as half of the world's energy needs by 2050. Developing countries can virtually stabilise their CO2 emissions, while at the same time increasing energy consumption through economic growth. OECD countries will be able to reduce their emissions by up to 80%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The State in the governance of sustainable mobility transitions in the
   informal transport sector
SO RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT
AB We aim to contribute to the theorization in the governance of sustainable mobility transition in the informal transport sector with the State as the central actor and meta-governor. Because of the need to accelerate radical transitions in shorter timeframes, the role of the State as an agent is being recently considered. Using the ongoing Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) as a case study, we expound on the governance styles of the State in reforming the various sub-systems that make up the complex informal transport sector of a developing country, the Philippines. The PUVMP is dubbed as the biggest non-infrastructure public transport reform project by the current Philippine government. Our work represents a departure from the dominant focus of extant literature, mainly characterized by studies on State-sanctioned formal transport systems in the Western context. A key insight of the article is that while the State can deploy instruments of governance to accelerate the destabilization of the incumbent transport regime, the speed at which the State can foster the development of new niches that can displace the old regime can still be gradual. We end by discussing limitations and agenda for future work.

TI Zoonoses and poverty - a long road to the alleviation of suffering
SO VETERINARIA ITALIANA
AB Populations living in poverty in the developing world suffer a heavy burden caused by infectious diseases, most of them zoonoses. The poorer populations also tend to be marginalised from the health sector and so are many of the diseases that affect them. The poor in every society, and particularly in developing countries, bear a disproportionately high share of the disease burden. There is a broad range of viral, bacterial, mycotic, chlamydial, rickettsial and parasitic diseases of global and regional importance given their major impact on the health and socio-economic development of many populations. Endemic infectious diseases, including zoonoses, together with emerging and re-emerging diseases, are mostly shouldered by poor and vulnerable populations. Livestock are important in supporting the livelihoods of poor farmers, consumers and traders throughout the developing world. The animals of poor people are particularly vulnerable to disease because of costs, absence or unsuitability of the animal health sector, etc. The impact of endemic animal diseases are mainly felt at the farm level, while a broader economic impact can occur with these diseases through the restriction of trade in livestock and their products. Addressing comprehensive and sustainable solutions to public health problems created by endemic infections cannot be achieved solely by the public health sector alone. Partnerships with other sectors, particularly agriculture, environment, education, local administration, will be necessary to contain and effectively control zoonotic and foodborne diseases that affect mainly the poor. International organisations could support developing countries by coordinating national intersectoral activities, promoting appropriate technology and public health education, community participation and encouraging decision-makers to commit themselves. This is the only perspective for improved quality of life of poor and marginalised populations.

TI Using social network analysis to examine the decision-making process on
   new vaccine introduction in Nigeria
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB The decision-making process to introduce new vaccines into national immunization programmes is often complex, involving many stakeholders who provide technical information, mobilize finance, implement programmes and garner political support. Stakeholders may have different levels of interest, knowledge and motivations to introduce new vaccines. Lack of consensus on the priority, public health value or feasibility of adding a new vaccine can delay policy decisions.
   Efforts to support country-level decision-making have largely focused on establishing global policies and equipping policy makers with the information to support decision-making on new vaccine introduction (NVI). Less attention has been given to understanding the interactions of policy actors and how the distribution of influence affects the policy process and decision-making.
   Social network analysis (SNA) is a social science technique concerned with explaining social phenomena using the structural and relational features of the network of actors involved. This approach can be used to identify how information is exchanged and who is included or excluded from the process.
   For this SNA of vaccine decision-making in Nigeria, we interviewed federal and state-level government officials, officers of bilateral and multilateral partner organizations, and other stakeholders such as health providers and the media. Using data culled from those interviews, we performed an SNA in order to map formal and informal relationships and the distribution of influence among vaccine decision-makers, as well as to explore linkages and pathways to stakeholders who can influence critical decisions in the policy process.
   Our findings indicate a relatively robust engagement of key stakeholders in Nigeria. We hypothesized that economic stakeholders and implementers would be important to ensure sustainable financing and strengthen programme implementation, but some economic and implementation stakeholders did not appear centrally on the map; this may suggest a need to strengthen the decision-making processes by engaging these stakeholders more centrally and earlier.

TI Public Hospital Facilities Development Using Build-Operate-Transfer
   Approach: Policy Consideration for Developing Countries
SO IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Background: Advantages and limitations of build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts in various forms of public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements have not been studied.
   Objectives: This study is the first of its kind to determine the framework, advantages, and limitations of BOT contracts for health care projects in selected countries.
   Methods: A comparative design was employed to identify factors affecting the development of medical facilities through the adoption of PPPs and the implementation of BOT contracts. England, Spain, Australia, Turkey, and Canada were selected, and data were gathered through well-known databases for the relevant studies. Electronic databases were searched using the keyword terms, "build-operate-transfer," "public-private partnerships," "health sector/health system," "health care facilities," "Spain," "Canada," "England or United Kingdom," "Turkey," and "Australia."
   Results: The findings revealed that while there was insufficient information transparency for adoption of the BOT contract model in developing medical facilities and building new hospitals, some similarities were observed in its adoption in public fields. Adoption of the BOT contract model has been proven feasible in the selected countries for the health sector, in particular, for the development of new hospitals. These contracts are usually long-term in nature to provide the private sector with the chance to appropriately exploit the field. Different countries utilize this model to meet public regional and long-term health care needs, where the goal is not just a matter of seeking the private sector's contribution.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that more information transparency is required for these types of contracts. Factors such as the term of the contract, the maintenance of the facilities built and their post-completion ownership status, facilities and credits offered to the private sector during the construction and operation phases, and the provision of financial and non-financial incentives to the private sector require deeper examination and should also be adjusted to the local contexts of the developing country.

TI Testing a Top-Down Strategy for Establishing a Sustainable Telemedicine
   Program in a Developing Country: The Arizona Telemedicine Program-U.S.
   Army-Republic of Panama Initiative
SO TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH
AB Objective:Many developing countries have shown interest in embracing telemedicine and incorporating it into their healthcare systems. In 2000, the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) initiated a program to assist the Republic of Panama in establishing a demonstration Panamanian rural telemedicine program. YPG engaged the Arizona Telemedicine Program (ATP) to participate in the development and implementation of the program.Materials and Methods:The ATP recommended adoption of a top-down strategy for creating the program. Early buy-in of the Panamanian Ministry of Health and academic leaders was regarded as critical to the achievement of long-term success.Results:High-level meetings with the Minister of Health and the Rectors (i.e., Presidents) of the national universities gained early program support. A telemedicine demonstration project was established on a mountainous Indian reservation 230 miles west of Panama City. Today, three rural telemedicine clinics are linked to a regional Ministry of Health hospital for teleconsultations. Real-time bidirectional videoconferencing utilizes videophones connected over Internet protocol networks at a data rate of 768 kilobits per second to the San Felix Hospital. Telepediatrics, tele-obstetrics, telepulmonology, teledermatology, and tele-emergency medicine services became available. Telemedicine services were provided to the three sites for a total of 1,013 cases, with numbers of cases increasing each year. These three demonstration sites remained in operation after discontinuation of the U.S. involvement in September 2009 and serve as a model program for other telemedicine initiatives in Panama.Conclusions:Access to the assets of a partner-nation was invaluable in the establishment of the first model telemedicine demonstration program in Panama. After 3 years, the Panamanian Telemedicine and Telehealth Program (PTTP) became self-sufficient. The successful achievement of sustainability of the PTTP after disengagement by the United States fits the Latifi-Weinstein model for establishing telemedicine programs in developing countries.

AB Open educational resources have been around for fifteen years since the term was adopted for the first time in 2002. To explore its research development progress research focuses, this study reviewed literature on OER from the year of 2002 to 2019 with a bibliometric method based on six indicators including publication year, distribution by country/area, distribution by institution, citation burst detection, top keywords, and highly cited publications. Based on the findings, five recommendations are proposed: (1) enhance international cooperation, (2) pay attention to OER's impact on developing countries, (3) explore sustainable mechanisms of OER projects, (4) improve the quality of OER, and (4) promote teacher training about OER. Hopefully, this essay could present an overview of OER research and provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners for future practice.

TI Spatio-temporal dynamics and livelihoods transformation in Wa, Ghana
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB This paper examines how indigenous peri-urban households in Wa, one of the fastest growing towns in Ghana are adapting to the effects of physical transformation of their environment. By analysing Landsat satellite images and using social research methods, the paper discusses the nature and extent of urban growth, its impact on periurban livelihoods, and the coping strategies of peri-urban households. Findings show that urban land in Wa increased by 5.73 times-from 5.75 km(2) in 1986 to 32.93 km(2) in 2016 with an annual growth rate of 5.9%. This growth led to the conversion of agricultural lands into residential and other uses. As a result, many indigenous peri-urban households are abandoning agriculture in search for urban-based employment as a safety net. The study recommends partnership between local government and landowners to identify and protect high potential agricultural lands in Wa; modernisation of the land governance and management processes in view of the loss of cultural and spiritual values associated with land; prioritisation of physical and spatial planning at the district level; and equipping indigenous peri-urban households with skills to assist them create sustainable livelihoods to compensate for the loss of their agriculture lands.

TI Is corporate environmental disclosure associated with firm value? A
   multicountry study of Gulf Cooperation Council firms
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Several studies have found a relationship between corporate social and environmental disclosure and firm value (FV) or accounting profitability. Where environmental disclosure has been the focus, though, only single-country studies have been published, and most of the previous research concerns the developed world. This study examines the association between corporate environmental disclosure (CED) and FV in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, where CED has been increasing from its previous low base. Findings from a multicountry sample of 500 firm-year observations using a 55-item unweighted environmental disclosure index suggest that CED is significantly and positively related to FV as measured by Tobin's Q (TBQ). The relationship is robust to using a weighted version of the disclosure index, individual countries and environmental disclosure subindices. Some evidence of a positive relationship between CED and return on assets is also found, but even where statistically significant, the relationship is much weaker than in the case of TBQ. For empirical and theoretical reasons, we recommend that future studies pay greater attention to market-based proxies, if possible, when investigating the value relevance of CED in both developed and developing countries. Our results suggest that both managers and policymakers in GCC countries should take a positive view of expanded CED.

TI Fragmentation and Coordination of REDD plus Finance under the Paris
   Agreement Regime
SO FORESTS
AB Under the Kyoto Protocol regime, various forms of financial support have been committed to helping the implementation of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as fostering conservation, the sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) in developing countries. We analyzed the fragmentation of REDD+ finance and suggested methods for its coordination under the Paris Agreement regime. The fragmentation of REDD+ finance was observed, but it was lower than that of general official development assistance (ODA). However, we found that the trend of fragmentation in REDD+ financing is different from that of general ODA, with a few major donors occupying a large portion of the total size of committed REDD+ finance. Thus, it may not be appropriate to consider the fragmentation of REDD+ finance merely as an obstacle that needs to be decreased. Still, the total amount of REDD+ finance should be increased and adjusted for various donor-recipient relationships, in consideration of the REDD+ finance options in the Paris Agreement. Some REDD+ countries have made progress in national REDD+ and accomplished emission reductions. However, REDD+ finance needs to be stratified considering the progress of national REDD+. For such forms of cooperation, an information-sharing and monitoring system that collects information on ongoing REDD+ cooperation, the commitment and expenditure of REDD+ finance, and the support needs of REDD+ countries at a global level should be established. Multilateral organizations need to provide safeguarding functions for developing countries that are isolated from bilateral REDD+ finance.

TI Solar for all: A framework to deliver inclusive and environmentally
   sustainable solar irrigation for smallholder agriculture
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Worldwide, off-grid solar photovoltaic irrigation is currently being developed with the expectation that it will help secure water access to increase food production, reduce fuel-based carbon emissions and energy costs, and increase human resilience to climate change. In developing countries across the Middle East and North Africa, South East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the adoption of solar technology in agriculture to lift groundwater is rapidly expanding, following decreases in pump costs, economic incentives, and development partner initiatives. Solar irrigation potentially provides a cost-effective and sustainable energy source to secure food production and sustain livelihoods in line with multiple Sustainable Development Goals, but achieving such potential requires improved policies and institutions to coordinate across numerous stakeholders, objectives, and approaches. This paper uses cases and observations from across regions to propose a framework to support policy, regulation, and monitoring for environmentally sustainable and socio-economically inclusive solar irrigation investments. While not exhaustive, the components seek to address the intersection of energy, water and food security, as well as social equity. The paper emphasizes the need for an understanding of how solar irrigation can be scaled to be both accessible for smallholder farmers and environmentally sustainable.

TI THE IDEA OF A HUMAN COMMUNITY OF SHARED DESTINY
SO JOURNAL OF DHARMA
AB This paper examines the idea of a Human Community of Shared Destiny and its relationship and contribution in the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The community of shared interest for humanity is a concept that represents China's flagship vision of a more just and secure world. This shared destiny for humankind is a new paradigm that is an inheritance, innovation and development of Marxian philosophy and traditional Chinese wisdom. As the world's largest developing country, China envisages itself as an active initiator and builder of world peace and global development. This vision of a global community covers the aspects of politics, security, economy, culture, ecology, global governance and international order. In this project, China expects to play the role of a global leader by focusing international efforts towards eradicating the global issues of poverty, reduced inequalities and sustainable ecological and economic development as well as promoting partnerships that are beneficial for progress of humankind. On the basis of analysing the characteristics of the thought of a global community of a common future, this paper studies the relationship between China's vision and its potential in realising the various SDGs for the purpose of a common good. It also discusses its realistic significance and value in the contemporary international society.

TI Expanding contraceptive choice in the developing world: Lessons from the
   Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Republic of Zambia
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB Background and objectives Women need different forms of contraception over their lifetime. In the developed world, they have access to some 20 different methods. In developing countries, only a few options are available. This paper focuses on four under-used methods: intrauterine devices, implants, emergency contraception and female condoms. It examines reasons for their low uptake, strategies used for their adoption, and challenges in sustaining these efforts, in two countries: Laos and Zambia.
   Methods In-country documentation and reports from international partners were reviewed; questionnaires were sent and interviews carried out with ministry officials, senior providers, and local representatives of international organisations and international non-governmental organisations.
   Results In Laos, the family planning programme is relatively young; its challenges include ensuring the sustainability of services and supplies, improving the quality of IEC to dispel misconceptions surrounding contraception, and developing novel distribution systems to reach rural populations. Zambia has a much older programme, which lost ground in the face of competing health priorities. Its challenges include strengthening the supply chain management, coordinating the multiple groups of providers and ensuring the sustainability of services in rural areas.
   Conclusions The contrast offered by Laos and Zambia illustrates the importance of regular evaluation to identify priority areas for improving contraceptive delivery.

SO DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB Energy poverty is a complex challenge, particularly in developing countries. Energy access is a prerequisite for economic development, and its absence perpetuates economic, health, and environmental disparities. The United Nations created SDG 7: "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy," to guide efforts toward achieving universal energy access. This article assesses the channels through which microfinance impacts SDG 7, identifying three main channels: funding and infrastructure, financial services, and microenterprise development. Each impact channel is supported by case studies of institutions that have utilised microfinance platforms to achieve energy development goals.

TI The Relevance of Circular Economy Practices to the Sustainable
   Development Goals
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB This paper identifies the extent to which circular economy (CE) practices are relevant for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The results of a literature review and a matching exercise to determine the relationship between CE practices and SDG targets show that CE practices, potentially, can contribute directly to achieving a significant number of SDG targets. The strongest relationships exist between CE practices and the targets of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The paper also explores synergies that can be created through CE practices among several of the SDG targets. Furthermore, it identifies several potential trade-offs between targets for decent work, safe working environments, human health and current CE practices relating to recycling of municipal waste, e-waste and wastewater, and provides suggestions how these can be overcome. The paper concludes that CE practices can be applied as a "toolbox" and specific implementation approaches for achieving a sizeable number of SDG targets. Further empirical research is necessary to determine which specific types of partnerships and means of implementation are required to apply CE practices in the SDG context.

AB This paper presents an ongoing, multi-year, student-run project to provide access to clean water at specific, targeted communities in Haiti. Project Haiti is a yearly student research, design, fabrication, test, installation, and training effort at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) to deliver sustainable water purifiers and originate a companion micro-business to sell excess clean water to the community. Haiti's rebuilding effort after the 2010 earthquake highlighted the need for sustainable development and cooperation among partnering NGOs in localized communities. Poorly managed relief and development efforts were characterized by lack of coordination, lack of local ownership, and resulting hardware and projects that were unsustainable. Lessons learned from the history of US-based aid to developing countries are taken into account each year. Specific criteria were developed for installation partner and community selection. Either a fully or partially solar-powered water purifier was installed in Haiti for operation by trained locals. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) training was also implemented among the local community using a translator. This community development model is a short-term, focused, and specialized approach that brings in the right people to partner with an existing long-term organization. The goals and timeline for this Solution Focused approach are clear and well-defined.

TI Sustainable Development Concept in the WTO Jurisprudence: Contradictions
   and Connivance
SO ESSAYS ON SUSTAINABILITY AND MANAGEMENT: EMERGING PERSPECTIVES
SE India Studies in Business and Economics
AB The Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO (henceforth the WTO Agreement) is primarily a trade agreement, negotiated with the objective of promotion and progressive liberalisation of international trade. The WTO preamble recognises that the relations between member states in the field of trade and economic development should be conducted with a view to "raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services." In this endeavour, it is acknowledged that states should allow for the "optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development." Beyond such an acknowledgement in the Preamble, the WTO and its covered agreements have largely ignored sustainable development as a binding obligation on the member states. It was perceived that such binding commitments were unnecessary as the WTO's focus is trade governance. Besides, the developing countries were genuinely concerned that any substantive obligation on sustainable development, specifically in the context of environment and labour standards, shall have an adverse impact on their competitiveness vis-a-vis developed countries goods and services. More importantly, the prospective sustainable development measures may have a strong likelihood of being misused as a protectionist tool for trade gains by advanced economies that have already attained higher standard production and process methods and livelihood standards. These concerns and oppositions have left the "sustainability" objective in the WTO much to be desired. This chapter is an attempt to understand the interlinkages and conflicts in the context of the legal foundation of "sustainable development" in the WTO architecture, an organisation created to administer trade rules. The chapter shall look specifically at the approach taken by the WTO panel and the Appellate Body in interpreting and developing the concept. Special attention shall be given to the concerns of developing countries that have all along opposed inclusion of the sustainability concept without elaborate negotiation and consensus.

AB A novel approach to providing primary care, the Doorstep Health model, is described for use in low-resource communities in developing countries. The model is still under development through a unique, collaborative process among social enterprises and other partners operating in different parts of both south Asia and sub Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, there has been enough experience with the model to demonstrate its clinical potential and to understand how it addresses simultaneously a number of key challenges posed by the explosion of non-communicable chronic disease - challenges which the traditional, institution-based healthcare model is ill-suited to meet. The model leverages the power of modern ICT tools, including mobile telecommunication networks, smart mobile devices, and mobile diagnostic tools. The model appears to have extremely low operational costs, and to be both potentially sustainable and rapidly scalable.

TI SMEs in sustainable development: Their role in poverty reduction and
   employment generation in sub-Saharan Africa
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Poverty alleviation has been positioned high on the international development agenda following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. African countries initiated various missions to establish sustained economic growth by increasing productivity with an ultimate goal of poverty reduction. The significance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in poverty reduction and employment generation is widely acknowledged. Despite the high failure rate amongst SMEs, particularly in the African context, some are striving with excellent results and are demonstrating signs of growth, innovation and sustainability. This paper explores the development of SMEs as a strategic measure for job creation in sub-Saharan Africa. It examines the role of SMEs in achieving sustainable employment in Africa. This study will benefit governments in Africa, getting them to focus on the development of the SMEs, and guiding them on how best to integrate SME development to achieve poverty alleviation. The recommendations proposed in this study may be helpful in policy formulation, business operation and regulatory practice for sustainable growth and development in the sub-Saharan African context.

TI Introduction: the provision of animal health services in a changing
   world
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB In the future, animal health services in developing countries will need to operate in a continuously changing policy, institutional and commercial environment. Firstly, the changing policies and priorities of national policy-makers regarding public and private sector roles, reinforced in Africa by the donors, have reduced funding and support for the large number of tasks that animal health services have traditionally performed, and there is continuing pressure from policy-makers to focus on what the public sector can do best. Secondly, poverty reduction has become one of the main criteria guiding the allocation of official development assistance, which has major implications for the main target clientele of veterinary services. Thirdly, population growth, increasing income and urbanisation are causing a marked increase in demand for livestock products in the developing world. As a result, the entire livestock commodity chain is undergoing major structural changes, which has significant implications for the definition and control of food safety standards. Fourthly, globalisation, and increasing trade and travel have greatly increased the risk of disease transmission between different countries and continents.
   Veterinary institutions in the developing world need to adapt to these challenges. They will have to be able to focus on the essential public sector roles. At the same time they must deliver those essential services to the poor, and provide the policy framework to ensure that the inevitable structural changes in the commodity chain take place in an equitable and sustainable fashion, with an acceptable level of health risk for the consumer. According to the weight given to these different objectives, changes in the institutional set-up need to be considered. This issue of the Scientific and Technical Review addresses these challenges. It begins by reviewing the basic economic characteristics underlying the provision of animal health services, and then examines the alternative delivery systems that are emerging in the developing world and their strengths and weaknesses. The implications for food safety and trade are specifically highlighted. Also included are the practical experiences of countries, from all along the development continuum, that have introduced alternative systems. This paper deals with implications for the future, and while the growing importance of veterinary care for companion animals is acknowledged, the focus is on veterinary services for food animals.

AB This study is focused on the issue of agritourism in developing countries, which is a growing phenomenon and an understudied topic by the academic literature. By developing an investigation on coffee tourism based on multiple stakeholder perspectives around the subject, we contribute to further the debate over potentialities and benefits of coffee tourism development. We applied grounded theory methodology and through an iterated process involving literature review, a case study on Costa Rica, interviews with coffee experts, and a survey with European tourists, we designed a theoretical framework of the benefits that coffee tourism can have on both local farmers, who are vulnerable and low-power stakeholders within the coffee supply chain, and on actual and potential coffee tourists. Our research pointed out that empowerment and cooperation, business diversification, sustainability, and creation of a destination image are the four main benefits for the local communities of farmers and their families and are also perceived to be creating favorable and attracting conditions for tourists.

AB Sustainable development is an important dimension for business incubators to improve tenant-businesses in the coffee value chain. This study focuses on business incubators addressing social and economic dimensions of sustainability in developing countries. Business incubators are perceived as important mechanisms for sustainable development as they involve relevant stakeholders and activities to interact each other. Prior research highlights the gap of theoretical explanation to understand business incubators linked to sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to provide a conceptual approach based on resource dependence theory to better understand strategies in interdependencies to address power imbalance issues of business incubators in developing countries. Strategies such as integration and coordination should be implemented in the incubator management to increase mutual dependencies and improve relationships to secure resources, thereby, providing quality services for tenants. Relationships with relevant partner organizations such as universities, business centers, and public research organizations represent opportunities for business incubators in boosting sustainable business development.

TI How REDD plus and FLEGT-VPA processes are contributing towards SFM in
   Indonesia - the specialists' viewpoint
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB In an effort to reverse the trend of deforestation and forest degradation, several international initiatives have been attempted. Though promoted in different political arenas, Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) - Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA), and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) share overlapping objectives of conservation of tropical forests. We explore specialists' viewpoint on FLEGT-VPA and REDD+ processes in Indonesia with reference to their contribution towards Sustainable Forest Management (SFM). The study shows that FLEGT-VPA and REDD+ regimes contribute towards SFM. While FLEGT-VPA improves enabling condition for SFM through governance reform, improved harvesting practices, and timber legality assurance system, REDD+ supports SFM through institutional strengthening, reforming policies and frameworks, mobilizing new and additional financial resources and increasing social and ecological resilience. We identified opportunities to achieve synergies between REDD+ and FLEGT-VPA by harmonizing their processes, tools, methodologies, technical assistance, capacity-building and funding mechanisms.

SO DISTANCE EDUCATION
AB Christian Medical College (CMC), India, and Tufts University School of Medicine, USA, have developed an 'institutional hub and spokes' model (campus-based e-learning supporting m-learning in the field) to facilitate clinical education and training at remote secondary hospital sites across India. Iterative research, design, development, and testing merged three key elements for effective mobile learning: an underlying learning management system to organize data; mobile access to a knowledge repository using commonly owned phones; and mobile applications that match the learner, learning theory, and mode of learning based on student-articulated needs. CMC is institutionalizing academic and technical support for e-learning and m-learning, ensuring future sustainability. Assessing and sharing best practices for mobile-supported training and resources will leverage strengths and build capacity across the CMC-secondary hospital mobile/e-learning network. This model can advance interdisciplinary health training initiatives in developing countries, improving clinical services and health for underserved populations across the world.

TI Challenges and Opportunities of Industrial Ecology Development in Iran
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB In developing countries such as Iran it was after economic crises and the increase in price of energy carriers and primary resources that industrial ecology was taken into consideration as a method in industrial states. 941 industrial states in Iran have a high potential in creating material and energy flow networks with the industrial ecology approach to prevent massive energy loss and valuable waste and enable optimization. The aim of this research is to study the challenges and opportunities of industrial ecology development in Iran by reviewing the experiences in Iran and other countries. Industrial states are in two groups in terms of clustering, concentrated and non-concentrated on a certain industry for each of which two examples including Charmshar and Salariyeh state and Semnan state are mentioned and analyzed, respectively. Many challenges were discovered in developing industrial ecology, two of which were more important than the others. The first challenge, an unsuitable clustering of industry in Iran with the industrial ecology approach thus disabling the adequate cooperation between complementary industries of material and energy flow networks and the lack of use of the potential by them. The second challenge, lack of a suitable information database to design and execute material and energy flow networks between industries, and without the necessary information, providing the basic needs for proceedings in relation to industrial ecology will be very difficult.

TI Exploring PPPs in Support of Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration: A Case
   Study from Cote d'Ivoire
SO LAND
AB Public-private partnerships (PPPs) may facilitate the implementation of fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA); however, the approach can be compromised when funding for land registration is insufficient or donor projects end. This paper aims to introduce a new form of PPP to the literature on FFPLA, further extending the discourse and options available on PPPs for FFPLA. A background review finds that whilst PPPs have had long standing application in land administration, there is room to explore approaches that seek increased involvement of non-conventional land sector actors. A case study methodology is applied to analyse recent developments of FFPLA in Cote d'Ivoire that includes a partnership between the government and a consortium of private sector companies. Results describe the novelty, challenges, opportunities, and success factors for the approach, when compared to existing forms of PPPs. It is found that the innovative partnership approach may create novel avenues for financing FFPLA in developing countries and for more active forms of participation of the private sector in improved land tenure governance. The model potentially creates sustainable buy-in from private sector corporations, who whilst not conventionally closely undertaking land administration efforts, rely intrinsically on it to achieve corporate social responsibility objectives.

TI Sustainability and impact of community water supply and sanitation
   programmes in Nigeria: An overview
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB One of the common features in Nigeria and indeed in many developing countries is that the impacts of community water and sanitation programmes are limited, because many of them are ill-conceived and are abandoned prematurely due to numerous attitudinal, institutional and economic factors. Thus, there is lack of sustainability in the sense of service delivery and upkeep of services. This paper proposes a set of pragmatic strategy that would involve all stakeholders, by ensuring effective partnership with a view to raising the sustainability level of community water and sanitation programmes. The paper believes that the key to sustainability is that all stakeholders involved in the consumption/use, maintenance, cost recovery and continuing support, perceive it in their best interest to deliver good and high quality services.

TI The Initial Training of Science Teachers in African Countries: A
   Systematic Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the initial training of science teachers in Africa based on selected research articles, in the period 2000-2020, that emphasize the importance of surveying knowledge that goes beyond those that historically have a longer path in the building of scientific knowledge, such as that of European or North American countries. The analysis included a total of 31 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. The findings indicate a lack of knowledge, or at least visibility, considering the initial training of African teachers, particularly in developing countries. South Africa leads the number of publications. Within the five African countries implied in the SLR the following outputs were identified: (i) a division between teacher education research that is 'place-based' and one that uses (only) 'universal theories' (such as Vygotsky and Bandura); (ii) a tension between the application of student-centered learning and teaching models and more traditional classroom practices. Finally, the majority of articles highlight the importance of investing in further research around teacher education. Based on these outputs the importance of international cooperation in teacher education research articulating theory and practice to ensure a global and local perspective towards sustainable development is reinforced.

TI Water management capacity building to support rapidly developing mining
   economies
SO WATER POLICY
AB Many developing countries are experiencing rapid expansion in mining with associated water impacts. In most cases mining expansion is outpacing the building of national capacity to ensure that sustainable water management practices are implemented. Since 2011, Australia's International Mining for Development Centre (IM4DC) has funded capacity building in such countries including a program of water projects. Five projects in particular (principally covering experiences from Peru, Colombia, Ghana, Zambia, Indonesia, Philippines and Mongolia) have provided insight into water capacity building priorities and opportunities. This paper reviews the challenges faced by water stakeholders, and proposes the associated capacity needs. The paper uses the evidence derived from the IM4DC projects to develop a set of specific capacity-building recommendations. Recommendations include: the incorporation of mine water management in engineering and environmental undergraduate courses; secondments of staff to suitable partner organisations; training to allow site staff to effectively monitor water including community impacts; leadership training to support a water stewardship culture; training of officials to support implementation of catchment management approaches; and the empowerment of communities to recognise and negotiate solutions to mine-related risks. New initiatives to fund the transfer of multi-disciplinary knowledge from nations with well-developed water management practices are called for.

TI Humanitarianism in surgery
SO HERNIA
AB Humanitarianism is by definition a moral of kindness, benevolence and sympathy extended to all human beings. In our view as surgeons working in underserved countries, humanitarianism means performing the best operation in the best possible circumstances with high income country (HIC) results and training in-country surgeons to do the same. Hernia Repair for the Underserved (HRFU), a not for profit organization, is developing a long term public health initiative for hernia surgery in Western Hemisphere countries. We report the progress of HRFUs methods to render humanitarian care.
   In a collaborative effort, Creighton University and the Institute for Latin American Concern developed an outpatient surgery site for hernia surgery in Santiago, Dominican Republic. Based on this experience, we developed a sustainable care model by recruiting American and European Hernia Society expert surgeons, staff members they recommended, building relationships with local and industry partners, and selecting local surgeons to be trained in mesh hernioplasty. HRFU then extended the care model to other Western Hemisphere countries.
   Between 2004 and 2015, the HRFU elective hernia morbidity and mortality rates for 2052 hernia operations were 0.7 and 0%, respectively. This is consistent with outcomes from HICs and confirms the feasibility of a public health initiative based on the principles of the Preferential Option for the Poor.
   HRFU has recorded HIC morbidity and mortality rates for hernia surgery in low and middle income countries and has initiated a new surgical training model for sustainability of effect.

TI Foreign inflows, commercial law, and dutch disease: Evidence from
   developing economies
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB It is commonly believed that developing markets require inflows of foreign capital to achieve their growth targets; however, recent research has shown that these inflows are either ineffective or even harmful to the economy. A surge in foreign inflows, such as foreign aid, remittances, and foreign direct investment, into developing markets, particularly, have been connected to the Dutch disease hypothesis. A sharp rise in such inflows will stimulate real exchange rate in receiving nations due to the uptick in the non-tradable sector and the downturn in the tradable sector. The purpose of this research is to investigate, using quantitative approaches, the variations of real exchange rate adjustments that occur in response to official development assistance, foreign direct investments, and international remittances flowing into developing markets. To investigate the onset of Dutch Disease over the period 2001-2020, this analysis makes use of panel data estimation techniques in the form of fixed and random effect models The findings of a substantial amount of econometric investigation revealed that Dutch Disease is present in developing countries. The scope of the study has been broadened to include an investigation of the expansion of both tradable and non-tradable industries. According to the findings of this study, larger inflows of foreign capital slow growth in the tradable sector (the industrial sector), while simultaneously boosting growth in the non-tradable sector (Service sector).

AB External crises such as the Bird Flu epidemic, as well as severe environmental problems, are changing overall attitudes towards research in human health and the environment. At present, the EU is putting pressure on developing countries in Asia and elsewhere to increase their environmental capacities and put forward methods of environmental management that support innovation and competitiveness. They are also being encouraged to participate in the Kyoto protocol and Bali processes on climate change. This paper aims to address the current issues faced by the EU in promoting environmentally friendly technologies in Southeast Asia, as well as to examine the opportunities for technological cooperation between Europe and Asia. It will use Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam-some of the EU's chosen recipients of official development assistance in the region-as case studies, in order to examine how these countries implement policies that incorporate environmental technology strategies designed to promote sustainable development. It will also attempt to identify the type of actions that are being pursued by their respective governments, with the support of the EU and its member states. Finally, the paper will suggest which types of environmentally friendly technologies and best practice could be transferred from Europe to Southeast Asia, and to the wider Asian region.

AB Experience in promoting suitable technologies and improving operational performance is drawn on to enable developing countries to make more effective use of local resources in the construction and maintenance of low-volume roads. Training and technology transfer projects require multidisciplinary consulting and advisory support, which may include courses and on-the-job training but may also require "twinning" and other linkages between institutions for a more substantial transfer of skills over a longer period. The process is illustrated by case studies from a range of national and international technical cooperation projects, including the global Management of Appropriate Road Technology research initiative and the World Road Association's World interchange Network. The cases are set within a framework of basic models of ways in which training and technology transfer can contribute to international construction industry development, which suggests an inverse relationship between project predictability and recipient autonomy. The analysis offers several general lessons for engineers involved in international technology transfer, including (a) the importance of assessing local administrative, social, cultural, and regulatory environments at the project design stage; (b) the need for an open-minded approach to the choice of technology; (c) the scope for working with and through the local private sector; (d) deciding on an appropriate mix of technical and management training; and (e) applying the principle of sustainability through recognition of recipient autonomy and maintained contact between provider and recipient institutions to build confidence through collaboration.

TI The effect of financial development on renewable energy demand: The case
   of developing countries
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The global economic costs of environmental pollution increase the importance of renewable energy sources. This paper analyzes the impact of financial development on renewable energy consumption in 34 upper middle income developing countries from 1994 to 2015. The long-term relationship between variables is estimated by applying Panel Pedroni cointegration and Kao cointegration tests. The long run effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption is investigated by using Fully-Modified OLS (FMOLS) approach. The empirical results indicate the presence of long run relationship between renewable energy consumption and financial development. Moreover, financial development increases the demand for renewable energy. Economic growth has a negative effect on renewable energy consumption, but consumer prices have a statistically insignificant impact on renewable energy con-sumption. The empirical evidence reveals that financial development triggers in increasing demand for environmentally friendly energy sources, i.e., renewable energy. Renewable energy consumption reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in nature as opposed to fossil energy consumption. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development goals, governments should implement incentives and tax policies that increase the demand of enterprises for renewable energy resources. In addition, investment opportunities in renewable energy resources to be created by public-private cooperation via financial arrangements should be increased. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Overcoming problems in Turkey's renewable energy policy: How can EU
   contribute?
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Fossil fuels cover most of the energy demand in the world, and this creates significant social, economic and environmental problems. Many countries have taken measures to increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES), especially in electricity generation, and the review of literature shows that the success of a country in RES diffusion depends on a comprehensive renewable energy policy which combines political commitment with stable and long-term support measures that stimulate technological innovation. As the largest economy in the world, EU has also taken steps to increase RES usage in electricity generation in member states. Similar to other developing countries, Turkey is learning lessons from EU experiences regarding RES policies, and Turkey is also reforming its legal framework in line with acquis communautaire as a candidate country. As a result, EU has a multiway impact on Turkey's renewable energy policy. An overview of Turkey's renewable energy policy showed that EU has significantly contributed to Turkey in shaping its renewable energy policy, and Turkey should increase cooperation with EU in order to utilize its renewable energy potential.

AB Dynamic development of the financial system has an increasing impact on the state and development of both national economies and the world economy. This problem is especially acute in developing countries and is predetermined by their economic, social and political development. It also requires constant evaluation and control over the level of their economic development in terms of financialization. Within the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy, the EU cooperates with the countries of the region to deepen and strengthen the relations and helps to increase the stability and sustainability of its Eastern neighbors. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia today are currently Associated Eastern Partnership members. Using the panel data for these countries over the period of 2007-2017, the relationship between economic growth and indicators of financialization of the economies was determined. To this end, a fixed-effect regression model, the statistical adequacy of which was confirmed by many indicators (significance levels, R-squared coefficients, the Breusch-Pagan test), is also used. It was determined that employment, exports of goods and services, added value created in the industrial sector, the ratio of bank capital and reserves to total assets, the share of.1 monetary aggregate in GDP, deposit rate, and Gini index had a positive influence on economic growth of the countries in question.

TI Para-social work to address most vulnerable children in sub-Sahara
   Africa: A case example in Tanzania
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable children is a universal challenge, particularly in developing countries lacking infrastructure of social welfare services, adequately trained workforce and educational programs. This article describes training and utilization of para-social workers to the social service needs of children and families. These supervised para-professional community based staff and volunteers can fill gaps in serving the needs of children and families, particularly where social welfare systems are undeveloped or severely stretched. We present the development of one such program as a case study, the Social Work Partnership for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Tanzania. A competency-based training model includes an introductory workshop, a six month-long supervised field component and subsequent training and technical assistance. The curriculum teaches practical skills to assist vulnerable children, especially those HIV affected, including assessing needs, implementing case management resource linkages, counseling, family support, and ongoing service coordination. Over 500 participants have begun the para-social work program in districts throughout the country. Participants report high satisfaction with the training, and knowledge scores consistently and significantly improve throughout the training. This partnership aims to create a sustainable para-professional workforce to address gaps of most vulnerable children in Tanzania and can serve as a model to apply social work principles and techniques in settings where professional and structural resources are highly limited.

TI Oil Politics and Indigenous Resistance in the Peruvian Amazon: The
   Rhetoric of Modernity Against the Reality of Coloniality
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB In June of 2009, indigenous protest over the Peruvian government's natural resource policies erupted, tragically, in a violent confrontation where 33 Peruvians lost their lives. Conflicts over natural resources are bound to increase, especially in developing countries, as governments development ambitions collide with indigenous peoples' territorial claims. This article, within the context of Peru's natural resource development agenda, examines the government's hydrocarbon development policies against indigenous resistance and protest. Turning to an alternative theoretical framework, modernity/coloniality, I argue that the government's development logic misrepresents indigenous perspectives on development, undermines indigenous territorial rights, and suppresses indigenous participation in Peru's natural resource agenda. A more complex reading of indigenous perspectives reveals a more sustainable approach to development, one that does not reject modern development, but does challenge the Eurocentric predilections of development.

TI Green supply chain management for a more sustainable manufacturing
   industry in China: a critical review
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an integrated environmental management tool for green transformation of the manufacturing industry and has remarkable potential to support China's target of carbon neutrality by 2060. To understand the development path of GSCM and the subsequent impacts in China, the systematic literature review, analysis and comparison method is applied. The management institution involves eight governmental departments. The policy system includes 7 National Laws, 2 Regulations of the State Council, and 100 Documents of the State Council, Ministries, and Commissions. The review compares the relevant policies of China, the USA, the EU, and Japan, which reveals that management system of multi-departmental collaboration leads to the avoidance and transfer of responsibility. We also find that the existing relevant legal system need to be improved, especially in terms of tax subsidy, incentive mechanism, environmental information disclosure and the range of industries involved. Corresponding suggestions are put forward in response to these identified problems. The overall picture of GSCM in China could serve as a useful reference for other developing countries.

AB A number of principles on environmental policy were agreed to at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. One of these is the importance of sustainable development so that we manage our environment not only for the health and economic benefit of today, but also for future generations. The second is adherence to a precautionary approach for environmental protection. Fundamental to our efforts to protect the environment is the establishment of appropriate regulatory mechanisms and the use of the best available science to make decisions, In and of themselves, however, regulations do not ensure safe applications of biotechnologies. We must often make decisions with imperfect knowledge. The precautionary approach suggests that when our knowledge is less than perfect, we will be protective of the environment and human health. Consequently, considerable thought must be given not only to the principles of biosafety, but also the practicalities of what constitutes a functioning programme, what the value of having such a programme is and whether that value balances the cost of establishing and maintaining a programme.
   The global biosafety regulatory landscape is quickly developing and evolving. The potential of biotechnologies to address national needs and economically attractive possibilities are well known. For practical and philosophical reasons, before countries can take advantage of these technologies, national biosafety mechanisms may be required. Consistent with international acceptance of a moral obligation to protect the environment, the value of having a biosafety programme seems quite high in terms of political capital. This is quite clear in the treatment of biosafety in Agenda 21 and the Convention on Biological Diversity. For the foreseeable future, technology transfer will necessitate concomitant regulatory oversight.
   While many developing countries are forming regulatory frameworks by adapting regulatory guidance already implemented elsewhere, cost sharing still carries a financial burden. The variety and disparity of potential frameworks necessitates normalization of both information/data requirements and relative stringency of regulatory oversight. Other costs include those for biosafety training, data collection and storage, and monitoring programmes, International guidelines and/or a binding protocol under the Convention on Biological Diversity, may help to assist the harmonization process while providing an overall umbrella for biosafety regulation thus reducing the costs of having to establish biosafety regulatory programmes de novo, Programmed training approaches that create networks of trained individuals on regional and subregional levels may facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of biosafety expertise at reduced costs. Providing useful, relevant information is a non-trivial task and can be expensive. With unique issues to address, developing countries may find limited use for existing assessments done elsewhere. Acquiring new knowledge may carry a high cost in both time and money.
   There are significant benefits to be derived from having biosafety mechanisms in place, but costs associated with the adoption and implementation of regulations may be substantial. Each country will have to weigh the benefits and costs for themselves to determine the best mechanism to achieve national goals for environmental protection and technology development. International cooperation and assistance can be helpful in this regard and, in many instances, will be necessary if all countries are to have national biosafety regulations.

TI The role of security sector reform in sustainable development: donor
   policy trends and challenges
SO CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper attempts to account for the gap between donor policies in support of SSR in developing countries, in particular in post-conflict African states, and their record of implementation. It explores the inadequacies of the present development cooperation regime and argues that a substantial part of this gap can be explained by the tension that exists between the prevalence of a state-centric policy framework on the one hand, and the increasing role played by non-state actors, such as armed militia, private security and military companies, vigilante groups, and multinational corporations on the other hand, in the security sector. This paper, which acknowledges the growing importance of regional actors and questions the state-centric nature of SSR, recommends a paradigmatic shift in the current approaches to development cooperation. The external origin and orientation of SSR needs to be supplemented by more local ownership at the various levels of SSR conceptualisation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation in order to enhance synergy between donor priorities and interests on the one hand, and local needs and priorities on the other hand.

TI Public-Private Partnerships and Sustainable Agricultural Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agriculture in Africa is not sustainable because average yields have been stagnating for decades due to underinvestment, especially in the development of agricultural markets, crop improvement and the sustainable management of agricultural systems. Low public sector funding for agricultural research and lack of incentives for the private sector to operate in areas where there is no market largely explain the yield gap in many food-importing developing countries. Yet, there are effective ways in which the public and the private sector could work together and jointly improve agricultural sustainability in poor countries. The public sector provides a favorable institutional environment for the development of agricultural markets and investment in rural infrastructure, facilitates local business development and funds research with local relevance. The private sector, in return, brings its considerable expertise in product development and deployment. This article illustrates how new forms of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for agricultural development can work in challenging environments. It discusses three promising examples of PPPs in which the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA) is actively involved, and shows that an experimental approach can sometimes be more effective than social planning in efforts to achieve sustainable agriculture.

TI The role of the G20 in governing the climate change regime
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB A wide array of institutions governing climate change has proliferated over the past years, influencing the rule-makings of the regime. One of them is the G20. When G20 leaders around the world convened in London to restore global economies, they stressed the importance of a 'resilient, sustainable, and green recovery' and reaffirmed their commitments to address climate change. This was followed by their agreement on phasing out inefficient fossil fuel energy subsidies over the medium term in Pittsburgh. The 'coexistence of narrow regimes in the same issue-area' could be described as 'regime complexes', which enable countries to adapt more readily, particularly when adaptation requires complex changes in norms and behavior. Given that responses to climate change would require changes in the domestic politics of different countries at different levels, loosely integrated institutions of regime complexes could be more advantageous for countries to adapt and in engaging with developing countries. This paper demonstrates that the G20's highly informal institutional setup as well as its flexible cooperation tools could enable its members to customize their policies and better engage with third-party countries. In addition, the G20 group could collectively influence other key countries to reach an agreement on some of the key climate change-related issues, thereby facilitating the United Nations process of climate change.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB China has emphasized the importance of implementing the concept of green development into the process of the Belt and Road initiative. Therefore, in the process of promoting the initiative, it is necessary to clarify its impact on the green development of the participating countries. Based on such consideration, this paper establishes Green Development Capability (GDC) index tomeasure the green development level, and uses the Spatial DurbinModel for empirical testing basing on relevant data on different cooperative patterns between China and participating countries. The results show: (i) Economic Development Cooperation, Environmental Governance Cooperation and Sustainable Cooperation are conducive to enhancing the GDC, while the cooperation of Resource Utilization based on fossil energy trading has adversely affected on GDC. (ii) The current cooperation approaches have spillover effects, but not yet broken the Spatial Club imbalance. (iii) Economic Development Cooperation, Environmental Governance Cooperation and Sustainable Cooperation contribute to the promotion of developing countries' GDC, but over-reliance on mineral exploitation has caused these countries to fall into Resource Curses and hinder them from playing Backward Advantage.

TI Who Neglects Neglected Tropical Diseases? - Korean Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of tropical infectious diseases of poorest people. Of 17 NTDs managed by WHO, two, guinea worm disease (by 2015) and yaws (by 2020) are targeted for eradication, and four (blinding trachoma, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, and lymphatic filariasis) for elimination by 2020. The goals look promising but 11 others are still highly prevalent. Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are one NTD which prevail over the world including temperate zones. They had been highly prevalent in Korea but are mostly disappearing at present through systematic and sustainable control activity. The successful experience of STH control enables Korean experts to develop many programs of NTD control in developing countries. Several programs of both official development aid and non-governmental organizations are now targeting NTDs. Most NTDs are low in health priority compared to their health threats because they are chronic, insidious, and of low mortality. No one, including the victims, raised priority of NTD control with a loud voice in the endemic field of the diseases. After the millennium development goals declared disease control over the world, NTDs are becoming less neglected globally. Even with limited resources, beginning a sustainable national program is the key for the control and elimination of NTDs. No more neglect, especially no more self-neglect, can eliminate diseases and upgrade quality of life of the neglected people.

SO JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB COVID-19 and the economic response have amplified and changed the nature of development challenges in fundamental ways. Global development cooperation should adapt accordingly. This paper lays out the urgency for new methods of development cooperation that can deliver resource transfers at scale, oriented to addressing climate change and with transparency and better governance. It looks at what is actually happening to major donor countries' development cooperation programs and where the principal gaps lie, and offers some thoughts on how to move forward, notwithstanding the clear geopolitical rivalries that are evident.
   The most immediate challenge is to provide a level of liquidity support to countries ravaged by the global economic downturn. Many developing countries will see double-digit declines in GDP, with some recording downturns not seen in peacetime. Alongside the short-term challenge of recovery, COVID-19 has laid bare longer-term trends that have pointed for some time to the lack of sustainability-environmental, social, and governance-in the way economic development was occurring in many places, including in advanced economies. This new landscape has significant implications for development cooperation in terms of scale, development/climate co-benefits, and transparency and accountability.

TI Smallholder dairy cattle feeding technologies and practices in Tanzania:
   failures, successes, challenges and prospects for sustainability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB In Tanzania, milk production under smallholder farming systems is season sensitive, fluctuations of feeds in both quantity and quality being the major driver. A dry season decline in milk production of over 40% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?. We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers' cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
AB The aim of the European Union Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade Action Plan and its Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) is to tackle illegal logging and trade in illegal timber, improve forest governance, and foster economic growth in the forest sector. This study employs a Q methodology to assess areas of consensus and disagreement among forest sector stakeholders in Ghana on good forest governance practices as applied to the VPA process. The consensus among these stakeholders is that the VPA process has improved the participation of civil society in decision making and the establishment of a robust verification system to promote transparency and accountability, which are critical for sustainable forest management. However, while the shared perspectives among stakeholders highlight the crucial role of the VPAs in promoting improved forest governance in Ghana, there are still areas of disagreement or tension regarding the issue of accountability, tree tenure rights, and the participation of local communities in the VPA process. The paper concludes by considering the practical implications of the findings for effective forest governance practices in developing countries.

TI Farmer's Adaptive Strategies on Land Competition between Societal
   Outcomes and Agroecosystem Conservation in the Purple-soiled Hilly

SO JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB The worldwide extension and intensification of farming during the last century has led to ecosystem degradation and caused a series of environmental problems. Conservation of ecosystem services in agricultural regions has been implemented by top-down government actions or initiated by resilience scientists in the developed countries, but little attention was paid in the developing countries, especially in some remote mountainous regions. The present paper presents a case study showing how local farmers obtained both maximal societal outcomes and agroecosystem conservation interests in the absence of distinct boundaries between agricultural and protected ecological areas in the densely populated purple-soiled hilly region of southwestern China. The local community (Yanting County) has developed a mosaic agricultural-forestry-fishery-stock breeding system with spatially targeted land uses, diverse agricultural productions and multiple ecological partnerships. It indicates that the local farmers have hereditarily perceived sound strategies on maximizing sustainable societal outcomes and optimizing trade-offs among macro-market, state policy, new technological facility and ecological reinforcement.

TI Economic Considerations in the Provision of Treatments for Rare Diseases
SO RARE DISEASES EPIDEMIOLOGY
SE Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology
AB Orphan Drug legislation in the USA, Europe and elsewhere has been incredibly successful in promoting the development of new treatments for rare diseases. Historically, payers have constructed special schemes that have facilitated patient access given the small total budget impact of these treatments. However, whilst each disease is rare, the number of licensed orphan drugs is growing rapidly. This, in conjunction with the high prices claimed for these treatments, has increased the total budget impact of orphan drugs. In the medium term, the feasibility of omitting orphan drugs from value for money type assessments is doubtful. The arguments for a special status for orphan drugs in reimbursement processes are reviewed in this article, and it is concluded that these arguments do not generally stand up to critical assessment. A new paradigm for the development and purchase of orphan drugs may be required. Given the strong parallels between the challenges of neglected diseases in developing countries and orphan diseases in developed countries, policy tools developed for neglected diseases; such as Public Private Partnerships and Advance Market Commitments, might be fruitfully applied in the orphan drug arena.

TI Political commitment to tuberculosis control in Ghana
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB As part of expanding and sustaining tuberculosis (TB) control, the Stop TB Partnership of the World Health Organization initiative has called for strong political commitment to TB control, particularly in developing countries. Framing political commitment within the theoretical imperatives of the political economy of health, this study explores the existing and the expected dimensions of political commitment to TB control in Ghana. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 purposively selected staff members of the Ghana Health Service and some political officeholders. In addition, the study analysed laws, policies and regulations relevant to TB control. Four dimensions of political commitment emerged from the interviews: provision of adequate resources (financial, human and infrastructural); political authorities' participation in advocacy for TB; laws and policies' promulgation and social protection interventions. Particularly in respect to financial resources, donors such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria presently give more than 60% of the working budget of the programme. The documentary review showed that laws, policies and regulations existed that were relevant to TB control, albeit they were not clearly linked.

TI A REAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT? SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS TREATY
   OBJECTIVE IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS AND BEYOND
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The European Community (EC) is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with several groups of developing countries. An element which the EC Commission likes to highlight is the objective of sustainable development. This article analyses the potential of this 'presiding principle' of sustainable development as a treaty objective in the EPAs and other treaties in international economic law. Defining parameters are the international law background on sustainable development and the role of treaty objectives in the process of interpretation. The main findings are that a sustainable development treaty objective is one (of many) legal tools to achieve an integration of economic, environmental and social interests. Its specific value lies in its substantive ambiguity which translates into domestic policy space in the implementation of international treaty obligations. This discretion is limited by any specific integration performed in the treaty negotiating process and expressed in individual treaty provisions. It is further qualified by the customary rules of treaty interpretation in international law where object and purpose is only one of several elements feeding into a holistic interpretation exercise. Its main weakness may be that it depends on domestic institutions to make effective use of the policy space to integrate and on international judicial bodies to exercise deference accordingly.

TI Assessing the Relationship Between Human Well-being and Ecosystem
   Services: A Review of Frameworks
SO CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
AB Focusing on the most impoverished populations, we critically review and synthesise key themes from dominant frameworks for assessing the relationship between well-being and ecosystem services in developing countries. This requires a differentiated approach to conceptualising well-being that appropriately reflects the perspectives of the poorest-those most directly dependent on ecosystem services, and their vulnerability to external and policy-driven environmental change. The frameworks analysed draw upon environmental sciences, economics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology, and were selected on the basis of their demonstrated or potential ability to illustrate the relationship between environmental change and human well-being, as well as their prevalence in real world applications. Thus, the synthesis offered here is informed by the various theoretical, methodological, and hermeneutical contributions from each field to the notion of well-being. The review highlights several key dimensions that should be considered by those interested in understanding and assessing the impact of environmental change on the well-being of the worlds poorest people: the importance of interdisciplinary consideration of well-being, the need for frameworks that integrate subjective and objective aspects of well-being, and the central importance of context and relational aspects of well-being. The review is of particular interest to those engaged in the post-2015 development agenda.

TI African Ubuntu and Sustainable Development Goals: seeking human mutual
   relations and service in development
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB It is generally assumed that 'development' is a universal concept, understood the same way in every culture. In Africa, progress is understood differently; human relations - including ancestors and future generations tied to the land - take precedence over development. The African concept of well-being is Ubuntu (I am a person through other persons), implemented in South Africa though truth and reconciliation, Ubuntu diplomacy, jurisprudence and People First (Batho Pele) policies. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are multilaterally negotiated and claim universality but are underpinned by European modernism (individuality, growth, separation of nature and humans, etc.). To be truly inclusive of Africa, they can do more justice to Ubuntu. However, official African positions on the SDGs emphasised industry and infrastructure, and overlooked restorative justice. Ubuntu prioritises the first five social goals, equality (SDG10), inclusivity (SDG16) and partnership (SDG17). Ubuntu would change the leading SDG theme into: 'life is mutual aid' (horizontal Ubuntu relationship) rather than the hierarchical 'leave no-one behind' (developed versus developing countries). Ubuntu would replace sustainability with the 'community of life' and individuality with 'collective agency'; and knowing through measuring with 'knowing through feeling engagement with others'. It prioritises process (strategies/now) over goals (abstract future).

TI Barriers to Clinical Research in Latin America
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Enhancing health research capacity in developing countries is a global health priority. Understanding the orthopedic burden of disease in Latin America will require close partnership between more-developed and less-developed countries. To this end, the Osteosynthesis and Trauma Care Foundation assembled a research consortium of Latin-American orthopedic leaders. Prior to the meeting, we surveyed attendees on perceived barriers to conducting research at their institutions. During the event, working groups discussed these barriers, developed strategies for addressing them, and planned future steps for collaboration. The participants established the need for global relationships that allow colleagues from Latin America to access to training and established investigational infrastructure of North American centers to address research questions relevant to their communities. As a result of the discussion, the International Orthopaedic Multicenter Study (INORMUS) in Fracture Care was initiated. Since then, an expanded international working group, Associacion de Cirujanos Traumatologicos en las Americas (ACTUAR), has been created with the purpose of promoting increased global partnership for research capacity development.

AB Energy Crisis and Environment Balance have been occupying a leading position internationally in both, the sociopolitical arena and technological developments. A developing country like India is under dual pressure to provide economic prosperity to its burgeoning population while maintaining the energy-environment balance. Current challenging situation is a good opportunity to develop products and systems which not only provide customer satisfaction at competitive prices but also does it in a sustainable, resource-friendly way. This paper outlines a proposal to set up a Research Park in an academic institute with the theme of Sustainability in HVAC field. The idea is to collaborate with the industry and association partners so that the students and faculty together can work on joint R & D projects which ultimately will result into innovative energysaving and environment-friendly technological products and systems. The metric on which the Research Park will base its output target is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through a multi-pronged approach. In this paper, a baseline of annual energy consumption by the HVAC sector in India has been drawn which works out to 137,026 GWh translating into 123.32 Million Metric Tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions.

AB The present paper is a longitudinal study which aims to develop and deliver cancer nursing education conferences in Honduras using volunteer nurse educators. This program intends to (1) perform site assessments of work environments and resources for cancer care in Honduras, (2) develop cancer nursing education programs, (3) survey conference participants continuing education needs, (4) deliver cancer nursing education conferences, and (5) share data with local and global partners for future cancer programs. The study draws on a longitudinal program development with site assessments, data collection, and educational conferences at two time points. Assessments and surveys were used for conference development and delivery by volunteer nurse educators. Site assessments and conferences were delivered twice. Data were collected regarding assessments and surveys to inform program development. Survey data revealed that < 4 % had formal training in cancer care and > 65 % had internet access. Participants desired more information about handling of chemotherapy, symptom management, and palliative care. Volunteer nurse educators perform site assessments and develop educational programming for cancer nurses. Local and global partners should explore internet-based programs between site visits to create sustainable education programs.

TI User-centered cotourism development
SO WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
AB The transfer of knowledge in an ecotourism project is never a one-way affair. An approach connected to bottom-up development is the submersion into another culture, while creating a new organizational structure. For co-creation, patterns that are often latent, such as leadership roles, the association with business, or even the color of education can be revealed by carefully facilitated brainstorms or workshops. Especially in countries with a different hierarchical structure, such as Indonesia compared to Holland, a careful analysis is needed before starting cooperation. Although a case is only a temporary view on a situation and not a guarantee for a truly sustainable system, the bottom-up approach tested has interesting starting points for an ecotourism system. Two cases were conducted in Bali, Indonesia, which resulted in guidelines on how to approach user-centered ecotourism development.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB PurposeThis study analyzes the role of cooperative behavior in facing the risk of encouraging innovative agricultural production projects by small-scale farmers in the context of farmers in developing countries.Design/methodology/approachA within-subjects field experiment was conducted with small-scale Colombian panela cane farmers. The authors used the collected data to run the regression analyses.FindingsThe results suggest that when small farmers can follow cooperative behavior by joining a group and pooling resources to face risk, they are more willing to invest in a novel and profitable alternative, albeit riskier. However, the possibility of cooperating with a group to invest in a novel production project depends on its expected risk level.Research limitations/implicationsThese results will help develop agricultural policies for sustainable development. Establishing informal networks for small-scale farmers to deal with unpredictable risks may aid in developing innovative systems.Social implicationsAgriculture is highly vulnerable to climatic impacts, which, combined with the inherent risk of innovation, may reduce small farmers' willingness to adopt innovation. Cooperation appears to be a mechanism for pooling resources and facing risk.Originality/valueResearch has focused on experimentally testing the effect of cooperative behavior when facing risk. The authors contribute to the literature by demonstrating the impact of the ability of small-scale farmers in rural areas to collectively manage risk on investment in innovative projects.

   Comparison Study between European and Asian Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Policymakers around the world are confronted with the challenge of balancing between economic development and environmental friendliness, which entails a robust set of measures in energy efficiency and environmental protection. The increasing complexity of these issues has imposed pressure on the Asian countries that have been acting as global factories. This paper proposes a meta-frontier slacks-based measure (SBM) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, with the hope that policymakers clarify the relationship between labor force, energy consumption, government expenditures, GDP, and CO2 emissions. Clarification of the causal relationship can serve as a template for policy decisions and ease concerns regarding the potential adverse effects of carbon reduction and energy efficiency on the economy. The results show: (1) Developing countries should establish their own climate change governance and policy frameworks; (2) Developed economies should seek to lower carbon emissions; (3) Energy policies play a pivotal role in energy efficiency improvement; (4) Top-down efforts are critical for the success of carbon reduction policies; (5) Learning from the success of developed countries helps to improve the effectiveness of energy policies; (6) Environmental policies should be formulated, and new production technologies, pollution prevention measures, and treatment methods should be introduced; (7) Governments are suggested to build long-term independent management institutions to promote energy cooperation and exchange.

AB Today's development model promotes the exploitation of natural resources regardless of the consequences for the environment or the impact that the quality of the environment has on people's lives and livelihoods. Without a shift in current consumption and production patterns, a sustainable model of development is out of reach. The 1992 Earth Summit acknowledged the need to marry growth and environmental sustainability, but more than 20 years later the world still lacks concrete goals, commitments, benchmarks of progress and frameworks to secure benefits across social, economic and environmental dimensions. The global South is emerging as a green growth laboratory, with innovation and creativity to tackle these concerns. This article analyses these efforts in the context of public policy, and shows that both positive and negative patterns in practice and policy are emerging, which should be considered as broader global green growth efforts are further consolidated and the post-2015 development agenda is being defined.

SO JOURNAL OF HUMANITARIAN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Number of disastrous events are rising globally, and it is important to manage the humanitarian supply chain management process to assist the disaster affected individuals in terms of relief operations. Effective relief operations can help to recover the materialistic loss due to any disaster. But there is a paucity of studies regarding this issue for developing countries. This study, hence, inspected the factors that affect the disaster supply chain management (DSCM) processes for relief operations in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the factors affecting relief operations through a qualitative analysis. This study used thematic analysis. Interviews were conducted with related supply chain individuals who were triangulated by data from related publications and blogs. Findings The study showed that sustainable DSCM for relief operations in Bangladesh require addressing few factors as organizational capabilities, warehousing locations and inventory management, infrastructure facility, coordination among partners, government and local authority support to create a transparent, efficient, effective and sustainable DSCM process for relief operations in Bangladesh. The system loopholes can be identified and rectified on the base of these factors. Research limitations/implications The number of interview respondents was limited to twenty who were selected randomly from four organizations. To create a sustainable disaster supply chain management (SCM) for relief operations few factors were considered as predominant factors in Bangladesh context to generalize the developing country contexts and other factors were not considered. Therefore, for farther humanitarian research, the model of this study can be used for quantitative research and the hypotheses can be tested empirically to get more acute findings. Practical implications As this study identifies the factors which can help to create a sustainable DSCM system for relief operations, hence practically, Bangladesh humanitarian SCM agencies will be beneficial from this study. They can easily recognize the factors need to be considered to create a sustainable DSCM process for relief operations. Originality/value This is a unique study carried out to examine the factors affecting DSCM process for relief operations in Bangladesh.

SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB The increased attention to environmentalism in western societies has been accompanied by a rise in ecotourism, i.e. ecologically sensitive travel to remote areas to learn about ecosystems, as well as in cultural tourism, focusing on the people who are a part of ecosystems. Increasingly, the internet has partnered with ecotourism companies to provide information about destinations and facilitate travel arrangements. This study reviews the literature linking ecotourism and sustainable development, as well as prior research showing that cultures have been historically commodified in tourism advertising for developing countries destinations. We examine seven websites advertising ecotourism and cultural tourism and conclude that: (1) advertisements for natural and cultural spaces are not always consistent with the discourse of sustainabihty; and (2) earlier critiques of the commodification of culture in print advertising extend to internet advertising also.

AB Covid-19 has exposed and deepened global inequalities: rich countries spent aggressively to sustain their economies and secured early vaccine access while most of the developing world continues to endure a growing disease burden. It also underlined the extent of inter-dependence and weaknesses in some of our international institutions and rules, many of which were established in the now discredited era of neoliberalism. There is a rich, complex, and difficult agenda going forward for international cooperation. This includes aiding developing countries in restructuring their debt obligations, and guaranteeing that multinational corporations pay their fair share with a robust international tax regime, better trade and intellectual property regimes, and better global regulatory frameworks for competition and social media. The failures of the past rules have led to political opposition to globalization.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB With increasing population, excessive use of electrical and electronic products and extreme demand of resources have compelled the linear economy to transform into Circular Economy (CE). In the current scenario, e-waste management has become the top priority of all the developed and developing nations especially those in the transition phase. The generation of e-waste has increased proportionally across the world and created an intense pressure on the firms to implement sustainable practices to redesign and recycle the products. The current status of the developing countries like India confronts number of challenges to manage e-waste produced, and the only possible solution is to minimize the waste generation and practicing recycling processes. For transforming into CEs, there is a need to identify the most influencing key enablers through which an effective and robust e-waste management (e-WM) system can be developed. An extensive literature review and expert judgments are expended to identify the most influencing key enablers of e-WM in circular economies, and, being the highest producer of e-waste, Mumbai (Maharashtra) has been chosen as the case location. To explore the strength of causal and effect enablers, the DEMATEL method is applied. This study has shown that 'Environmental management system' (EMS) is the most significant and important driving enabler to influence all the other existing enablers. This study has also highlighted that e-WM can be efficient if it focuses on producing eco-friendly products, developing strict legislations, building green image and supporting the producers to implement CE practices. This study helps stakeholders and policy makers to reduce the burden from the environment and focus on developing an efficient e-WM system on the basis of identified key enablers like EMS and collaboration with environmental partners to contribute towards CE transition.

TI Reconciling global aspirations and local realities: Challenges facing
   the Sustainable Development Goals for water and sanitation
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ambitious and inclusive, but how well are these global aspirations likely to result in implementable policy change for water and sanitation? This article assesses governance challenges at the local level associated with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which pledges to ensure sustainable water and sanitation for all. The majority of developing countries manage services at the subnational level, making the quality of local governance the key ingredient for improvements in the sector. This article first reviews prior shortcomings in global monitoring efforts and how SDG 6 was formulated to address them. The analysis then examines local governance challenges facing SDG 6 and potential barriers to implementation. These barriers manifest as both contradictions within SDG 6 itself as well as contradictions between SDG 6 and the Sustainable Development Agenda more broadly. As SDG monitoring rubrics undergo further reformulations, it may be necessary to prioritize between goals and targets, or otherwise stagger the timing of their promotion and implementation.

SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Partnerships between developed and developing country institutions are increasingly becoming important in addressing contemporary global health challenges faced by health systems. Inter-university health collaboration such as the Nottingham Trent University (UK) and Makerere University School of Public Health (Uganda) partnership provide opportunities for working together in training, research and service delivery while strengthening health systems. This paper shares the experiences, achievements and opportunities of this partnership in co-learning and supporting the health system in Uganda. This includes a project being implemented to strengthen the training, supervision and motivation of community health workers in rural Uganda. Training and research are a key focus of the partnership and have involved both staff and students of both institutions including guest lectures, seminars and conference presentations. The partnership's collaboration with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health (Uganda) and local health authorities has ensured participation necessary in supporting implementation of sustainable interventions. The partnership uses several channels such as email, telephone, Skype, Dropbox and WhatsApp which have been useful in maintaining constant and effective communication. The challenges faced by the partnership include lack of funding to support student mobility, and varying academic schedules of the two institutions. The experiences and prospects of this growing partnership can inform other collaborations in similar settings.

TI WTO after Seattle. Ideological powerhouse in need of political
   sustainability
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB The breakdown of negotiations on a 'Millennium round' in the WTO has left the world trade organisation on a sidetrack. The breakdown, which did not come unexpectedly, was caused by a combination of political, institutional and cognitive-ideational factors. While WTO's purpose remains to enhance market liberalisation under a non-discrimination regime (efficacy goal), it is in need of renewed legitimacy and also greater organisational efficacy. A contradiction has emerged between the formal (consensus, one nation-one vote) and informal (great power dominance) structures that undermines its legitimacy in the eyes of in particular many developing countries and civil society. While the WTO will have to live with such a dualistic decision-making system, a new balance between the two structures will have to be struck. Also the tendency to force new items on to its agenda and speed up liberalisation has turned out to be counterproductive. At the same time, the capacity of the organisation to handle the agenda is far from sufficient. One solution which may reduce this problem and at the same time could offer greater legitimacy is to 'out-source' several pre-negotiation tasks to other institutions, mainly UNCTAD, UNEP and other UN bodies, and consider seriously to leave work on social clauses to the ILO.

   development partners
SO AFRICAN SECURITY REVIEW
AB To achieve development in a state of insecurity is a mirage. Africa is caught in this web, as every sub-region faces security challenges. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were developed as frameworks to fast track development in developing countries and sustain it in developed countries through global partnerships. This study is an advocacy to reinvent the role development partners can play to prevent and contain insecurity in the continent. It examines insecurity and development scenarios of countries in Africa, relying on the analysis of secondary data. Based on the triangulation of the Development Partnership Approach and Structural-Functional Approach as the framework for the study analysis, the findings suggest that development partners need to do more to prevent and contain insecurity in the region. The study proposes ways the development partners can achieve these.

TI Relationship between population growth, price level, poverty incidence,
   and carbon emissions in a panel of 98 countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The objective of the study is to examine the dynamic linkages between population growth, price level, poverty headcount ratio, and carbon emissions under investigation of different plausible hypothesis, including "population-induced poverty trap," "welfare-reducing effects," "environmental Kuznets curve," and "pollution haven" hypotheses in the cross-sectional setting of 98 developed and developing countries for the period of 2011. The study used cross-sectional regression and switching regression regime for empirical analysis. The result shows a positive relationship between changes in price level and carbon emissions that verify "welfare-reducing effects," while there is a negative relationship between population growth and poverty at varying poverty threshold to support the "Gary Becker human capital theory." Further, there is a positive relationship between poverty rates and carbon emissions across countries. The results verified the "pollution haven" hypothesis in account of increase in pollution through financial liberalization policies. A U-shaped relationship is found between economic growth and carbon emissions in a given time period. The study concludes that globalized world should have to be careful when devising environmental sustainability policies, as it is important to provide social safety nets to the lower income strata group; hence, it would be helpful to achieve global green development agenda.

AB This year the World Leaders considered and adopted the new ambitious Sustainable Development Agenda "Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" to end poverty and universally promote shared economic prosperity, social development and environmental protection by 2030. This article explores new realities of the Sustainable Development agenda in the light of the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is clear today that the global development strategy requires a system renovation and new approaches, corresponding with the reality and challenges of the 21st century. Kazakhstan, being one of the 50 countries participating in the national consultations process on the post-2015 Agenda, brought its own contribution to "The Future We Want" programme. The fruitful cooperation with the European Union adds more perspectives for Kazakhstan as one of the most dynamic developing countries in the Central Asian region. The authors emphasized the importance of the United Nations Organization (UN) leadership in the global strategic planning and controlling long-term strategies, including cooperation between states and civilizations, and inclusion of all points of view, especially that of the youth. This article is intended for specialists as well as a wider audience (e.g. students), who are interested in international relations and organizations, international cooperation, sustainable development, and foreign policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

TI Development and Implementation of a Pediatric Care Program in a
   Developing Country
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Palliative care is recognized as an important component of care for children with cancer and other life-limiting conditions. In resource limited settings, palliative care is a key component of care for children with cancer and other life-limiting conditions. Globally, 98% of children who need palliative care live in low-or middle-income countries, where there are very few palliative care services available. There is limited evidence describing the practical considerations for the development and implementation of sustainable and cost-effective palliative care services in developing countries.
   Objectives: Our aim is to describe the key considerations and initiatives that were successful in planning and implementing a hospital-based pediatric palliative care service specifically designed for a resource-limited setting.
   Setting: Bangabandu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) is a tertiary referral hospital in Bangladesh. Local palliative care services are very limited and focused on adult patients. In partnership with World Child Cancer, a project establishing a pediatric palliative care service was developed for children with cancer at BSMMU.
   Results: We describe four key elements which were crucial for the success of this program: (1) raising awareness and sensitizing hospital administrators and clinical staff about pediatric palliative care; (2) providing education and training on pediatric palliative care for clinical staff; (3) forming a pediatric palliative care team; and (4) collecting data to characterize the need for pediatric palliative care.
   Conclusion: This model of a hospital-based pediatric palliative care service can be replicated in other resource-limited settings and can be expanded to include children with other life-limiting conditions. The development of pilot programs can generate interest among local physicians to become trained in pediatric palliative care and can be used to advocate for the palliative care needs of children.

TI A global perspective on avian influenza
SO ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB Global public health security is both a collective aspiration and a mutual responsibility that demands cooperative action at all levels. The expansion of the current H5N1 avian influenza enzootic and its incursion into human health presents a real and significant threat of an influenza pandemic. The world has for the first time an unprecedented opportunity for pandemic preparation. Current global efforts to tackle the H5N1 pandemic threat are centred around the framework of the International Health Regulations (2005) that requires countries to openly share disease intelligence including clinical samples, viruses and epidemiological information. Present international initiatives also seek to establish more equitable allocation and sharing mechanisms for developing countries, of therapeutic resources, public health interventions and other broad-based support in the event of a pandemic. To be sustainable, country preparatory efforts need to be integrated within wider national emergency preparedness frameworks and emphasise the strengthening of basic capacities in disease surveillance, outbreak response and health systems that can respond to a range of public health emergencies. Such capacity building represents permanent investments in health that will have enduring benefits beyond a pandemic. Preparations must also go beyond the health sector; greater promotion of intersectoral cooperation and an adoption of a whole-of-society approach to preparation is recommended. Broad collaboration is vital in addressing the complex challenge posed by influenza to our collective security.

TI Situation and measures of China's CO2 emission mitigation after the
   Paris Agreement
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY
AB Global response to climate change has entered the phase of full implementation of the Paris Agreement. To control the global temperature rise below 2 degrees C, all countries must make more efforts to reduce emission. China has combined its goal of emission reduction for combating climate change with its domestic sustainable development strategy to promote energy revolution and the transition of economic development to low-carbon patterns. Through reinforcing the commitment and action before 2020, the CO2 intensity of GDP can decrease by more than 50% by 2020 compared with that of 2005, and the external commitment target of a 40%-45% decrease can be over fulfilled. Currently, under the new economic normal, China further strengthens the policy measure, vigorously saves energy, enhances energy use efficiency and the economic output benefit, and simultaneously develops new and renewable energy and accelerates energy structural decarbonization, so that the annual decrease rate of the CO2 intensity of GDP keeps a high level of more than 4% and remains increasing. Thus, the decrease rate of the CO2 intensity of GDP will exceed the GDP growth rate, and then CO2 emission will peak around 2030. This will promote the fundamental turning of economic development mode, and lay a foundation for the establishment of a sustainable energy system with near-zero emissions and with new and renewable energy as the main body in the second half of this century. China implements the concept of green low-carbon development and accelerates the low carbon transition of energy and economy to achieve win-win results in economic growth and CO2 emission mitigation, and these policies and actions will also provide experiences for many other developing countries. On the other hand, China will continue to play a positive and constructive leading role in the implementation of the Paris Agreement internationally, and promote the construction of new mechanisms of win-win cooperation, fairness and justice and common development for global climate governance. Moreover, China will make an effort to build a community of common destiny for mankind, promote pragmatic cooperation among countries, especially among developing countries, and take combating climate change as a new development opportunity for jointly moving toward climate-friendly low-carbon economic development path.

TI A Registry of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions: Goals,

SO AMBIO
AB This article examines key issues in operationalizing a registry of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) undertaken by developing countries party to the United Nations framework convention on climate change. It analyzes goals, outcomes, and institutional prerequisites underlying various proposals to determine how a NAMA mechanism could work in international climate cooperation. The different proposals for how NAMA shall be designed relate to three basic effort-sharing arrangements in a future climate regime: binding commitments for all Parties, purely voluntary commitments for all, and legally binding commitments for Annex I countries but voluntary ones for others. We conclude that a NAMA registry could be designed so as initially to suit all three types of effort-sharing regimes. The article identifies three areas of potential common ground in a registry irrespective of effort-sharing type: the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the sustainable development objectives of the Convention, and the need for a systemic transition toward low-carbon energy technologies.

TI ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN GLOBAL TRADE AND MULTILATERAL
   NEGOTIATIONS
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY: ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB World exports and imports are quickly recovering after the 2008-09 sharp decline in merchandise trade, as illustrated by global trade performances in the first and second quarters of 2010. In spite of this impressive recovery, domestic concerns in OECD countries about employment, competitiveness and China's exchange rate policy have created a difficult political environment for further liberalisation under the Doha Round. Interestingly, developing countries, which were reluctant to engage in a new round of trade negotiations back in 2001, are now in the vanguard of those that wish for a swift conclusion of the talks, even if consensus on the ambitious 'development package' envisaged in Doha remains elusive. At the same time trade has been the subject of unprecedented attention and scrutiny in the climate change talks. In a world where multilateral cooperation is in crisis there is a dire need for the international community to generate new types of arrangements and innovative responses to the imperatives of development and the global transition to a low-carbon economy.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The approach to the assessment and management of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) has been the subject of a series of seminal symposia convened at the annual meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Since 1995, a five module approach to ecosystem -based management (EBM) of LMEs has been the focus of 110 economically developing countries around the globe engaged in 22 LMEs. A sum of $3.1 billion in financial assistance from the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank has been provided to support this global movement towards recovery and sustainability of LME goods and services in partnership with several OECD countries, five UN agencies, and two NG0s. LME stressors of prime concern are nutrient over enrichment and climate warming stress from projected levels of reduced primary productivity in LMEs located between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S. Successful mitigation actions for reducing nutrient over enrichment in LMEs, and adaptive precautionary actions for protecting fish and fisheries in LMEs in the high -risk circumglobal belt are addressed. The paper concludes with comments on the unity of approach in the linking of science and policy in advancing toward sustainability of the world's LMEs in accordance with Rio + 20 goals.

CY DEC 01-04, 1999
CL Nairobi, KENYA
SP Govt Netherlands, Govt Ireland, Govt Kenya
AB Official development assistance (ODA) has played an important role in the development process and poverty alleviation in Africa since the end of World War II. The rationale for ODA was encapsulated in several theories notably the donor-oriented theory or international relations theory and supplemental theories of foreign aid. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, it was emphasized that the implementation of Agenda 21 would entail large resources that could, in the short run, be out of the teach of many developing countries. Thus, in the spirit of international cooperation for development, the international community acquiesced on the need for increased ODA flows to developing countries, most of which are in Africa.
   However, while the need for ODA has increased, the flow has declined and is characteristically unpredictable. The decline has had far-reaching adverse consequences for the promotion of realistic sustainable development in developing countries, including those in Africa. Hence, the fundamental questions are what went wrong and what must be done to arrest and reverse the decline in foreign aid flows, particularly to Africa?
   Thus far, although the level of implementation varies from one country to another in the continent, some common areas of implementation of Agenda 21 may be identified. At the national level, these include the integration of Agenda 21 measures into national economic policies, strengthening of environmental laws and creating them where they do not exist. There have been actions in the consolidation or creation of environment institutions. Other actions relate to environment impact assessments and capacity building. In regional actions, intergovernmental organizations have begun to take a leading role in the co-ordination of regional environment programmes. On the substantive issues, the questions relating to natural resources management, poverty, population, human settlements, health and waste and hazardous materials are currently receiving attention. At the international level, co-operation between the United Nations' organizations and the World Bank has increased for the implementation of, freshwater and food security measures in developing countries. The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) as made. some contributions in the financing of projects in biodiversity, climate change, international waters and the prevention of ozone layer depletion. And more importantly, the United Nations Development Programme's Capacity 21 Programme is intended to promote capacity building in developing countries.
   Progress in sustainable development in Africa has not been substantial because of enormous difficulties encountered at all levels of implementation. The forces emanating from the weak socio-economic structures of African countries and the international economic environment have acted as impediments to progress. At the national level, progress in sustainable development is hindered by the shortage of skilled staff, paucity of training facilities, lack of integration and co-operation among institutions, inadequate information, incomplete integration of all stakeholders into sustainable development programmes and counter-productive government programmes. At the regional level, sustainable development has experienced difficulties as a result of duplication of efforts and waste of scarce resources. There is lack of commitment by countries to full participation in regional initiatives. Also, the lack of financial resources poses serious difficulties to the implementation of programmes. At the international level, the major difficulties include inadequate and unpredictable funding of programmes in African countries. Also, the disadvantages of African countries in the international economy have massively militated against sustainable development in Africa.
   The decline in bilateral and multilateral ODA flows to Africa was due to the unfavourable circumstances emanating from the world economy, the developed countries and African countries. The collapse,of the former Soviet Union and the emergence of new states increased demand for ODA from the developed countries and shifted attention away from Africa. In the 1990s, most developed countries were confronted with the need to reduce budgetary. deficits at home. Along with this, the European Union countries were concerned with the agreement to reduce fiscal deficits as a condition to attain monetary integration during the decade. The 1990s were particularly a period of aid fatigue in the developed countries owing to perceived poor results in the utilization of aid in the continent. Aid utility has suffered from poor aid co-ordination and management. Furthermore, the political instability in some countries in the continent represented a serious setback to the advancement of sustainable development.
   As it is today, African countries run the risk of losing the gains made in sustain-able development because of the stated difficulties. ODA is critical to the implementation of sustainable development in Africa. It is important that new and more innovative methods are found to ensure increased flows to priority areas in sustainable development. In addressing these, actions need to be taken at all levels of implementation. At the national level, new methods of policy co-ordination are desirable to harmonies the interests of bilateral and multilateral donors. There is a need for more stringent laws and regulations to deter corruption and mismanagement of aid. The administrative, political and economic bottlenecks to full disbursement of allocated ODA should be identified and removed. African countries should get more involved in the creation of appropriate aid constituencies in the developed countries to lobby lawmakers to ensure increases in aid disbursements to Africa. Additionally, African countries should endeavour to improve their internal taxation systems to raise additional funds for sustainable development, especially for the creation of sustainable development institutions. At the regional level, regional development banks and intergovernmental organizations should assist in the generation of additional ODA to African countries..
   However, the more enduring efforts would come from the international community. At this level, the way forward includes stronger political will in developed countries to commit more aid for sustainable development, the need to disburse aid on a timely basis, the reduction of aid tying and the channelling of aid to priority areas of sustainable development as identified by African countries. Above all, the international community should take appropriate steps to remove the obstacles to the external trade of African countries in order to enhance their autonomous base for the long term financing of sustainable development. The multilateral agencies, especially those of the United Nations,are currently engaged in restructuring for greater effectiveness because, of changing global circumstances. The international community should effectively fund these agencies to enhance their capacity to effectively deliver on sustainable development issue's in Africa.

TI Sustainable development and climate change: lessons from country studies
SO CLIMATE POLICY
CT Workshop on Development and Climate
CY SEP, 2006
CL Paris, FRANCE
AB Sustainable development has been suggested as a framework for integrating development and climate change policies in developing countries. Mainstreaming climate change into sustainable development policies would allow these countries to achieve their development goals while addressing climate change. A number of research programmes have investigated how potential synergies could be achieved at national level and what kind of trade-offs between the various aspects of sustainable development have to be faced. An overview of these studies is provided, focusing on national case studies. The energy and transportation sectors are covered in many studies, but some attention is also given to the infrastructure sector and water supply. Most existing development policies will not lead to a sustainable development pattern, since they insufficiently address climate change. However, good opportunities exist for integrated policies to achieve development goals while engaging with climate change. The energy and transportation sector studies identified many alternative national low-cost policies with much lower GHG emissions than the business-as-usual policy. Opportunities are identified for alternative national development policies for infrastructure and water supply that provide resilience against climate variability and climate change.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB This paper focuses on the relationship between the principle of "Common but Differentiated Responsibilities" (CBDR) and the implementation of post-2015 agenda. Based on analysis of the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's report "The Road to Dignity by 2030" and the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the studies of the evolution of the principle of "CBDR" and its impact on the implementation of the coming SDGs, the paper sums up that following the principle of "CBDR" will lead developed and developing countries, i.e. North and South, to more successfully implementing post-2015 sustainable goals and targets, both at home and in international development cooperation in the future.

Following this logic, the Biotrade Initiative was set up as an international framework to create new 'bio-partnerships' This programme carries opportunities for developing countries to sustainably use and commercialize biodiversity. However, its use as an engine for economic growth in these countries might be limited by institutional and macro-economic constraints.

TI Conceptualising education quality in Zambia: a comparative analysis
   across the local, national and global discourses
SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
AB Building on the Education for All movement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development re-emphasises quality education as a discrete goal. Contextualising the discussion surrounding this goal in Zambia, this study examines how education quality is conceptualised by educational stakeholders at local, national, and global levels. Triangulating teacher survey and interview data with policy documents from the government of Zambia and UNESCO, we found simultaneous convergence and divergence regarding the concepts of education quality espoused at each level. Convergence was shown in the critical influence of the economic tradition within education and the perceived role of schools in fostering resilient individuals and communities. Divergence was observed through the varying meanings assigned to similar concepts and the dissimilar influences of the humanistic and organisational management traditions at different levels. We discuss the implications of our findings for fostering collective efforts among key partners toward the achievement of quality education in Zambia.

SO NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI
AB The Doha Ministerial Declaration, adopted at the WTO Ministerial Conference in 2001, agreed to start negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving discipline on fisheries subsidies, taking into account the importance of this sector to developing countries. The Negotiation Group on Rules has regularly met in Geneva to fulfill the mandate. So far, there was broad agreement that the Group should strengthen discipline through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and over-fishing. However, several unresolved issues can be still identified. One is an issue on sustainable development. Specifically, the question "to what extent the WTO should incorporate the element of fishery resource conservation into its new discipline of fisheries subsidies" remains unresolved. This paper reviews current developments on the issue of fisheries subsidies discussed at the WTO, OECD, and other relevant international organizations.

TI Impact of FinTech, governance and environmental taxes on energy
   transition: Pre-post COVID-19 analysis of belt and road initiative
   countries
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB This study investigated the FinTech, governance and environmental tax factors affecting energy transition in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries, in the context of COVID-19. A balanced panel representing 148 BRI partner countries, comprising 78 members from high-and upper-middle income developed countries and 72 members from low-and lower-middle income developing countries, with reference to the 2013-2021 period, was used for this study. This study employed a two-step system generalised method of moments (GMM) model, which was validated through the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. The findings indicate that FinTech, globalization, and environmental taxes contributed significantly and positively to the energy transition in the entire BRI sample. However, inflation and COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the energy transition, whereas urbanisation negatively and insignificantly impacted the energy transition. In developed countries, all variables except urbanisation, inflation, and COVID-19 had a significantly positive effect upon the energy transition. On the other hand, in developing countries, while FinTech, environmental taxes, and high-level governance had a significant positive impact, other factors negatively impacted the energy transition. Additionally, this study suggested a balanced policy implication and future work areas that would be helpful to policymakers, governments, and academia for boosting and exploring energy transition and related aspects.

TI Progress towards early detection services for infants with hearing loss
   in developing countries
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
CT International Conference on Newborn Hearing Screening
CY MAY 31-JUN 03, 2006
CL Lake Como, ITALY
AB Background: Early detection of infants with permanent hearing loss through infant hearing screening is recognised and routinely offered as a vital component of early childhood care in developed countries. This article investigates the initiatives and progress towards early detection of infants with hearing loss in developing countries against the backdrop of the dearth of epidemiological data from this region.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study based on responses to a structured questionnaire eliciting information on the nature and scope of early hearing detection services; strategies for financing services; parental and professional attitudes towards screening; and the performance of screening programmes. Responses were complemented with relevant data from the internet and PubMed/Medline.
   Results: Pilot projects using objective screening tests are on-going in a growing number of countries. Screening services are provided at public/private hospitals and/or community health centres and at no charge only in a few countries. Attitudes amongst parents and health care workers are typically positive towards such programmes. Screening efficiency, as measured by referral rate at discharge, was generally found to be lower than desired but several programmes achieved other international benchmarks. Coverage is generally above 90% but poor follow-up rates remain a challenge in some countries. The mean age of diagnosis is usually less than six months, even for community-based programmes.
   Conclusion: Lack of adequate resources by many governments may limit rapid nationwide introduction of services for early hearing detection and intervention, but may not deter such services altogether. Parents may be required to pay for services in some settings in line with the existing practice where healthcare services are predominantly financed by out-of-pocket spending rather than public funding. However, governments and their international development partners need to complement current voluntary initiatives through systematic scaling-up of public awareness and requisite manpower development towards sustainable service capacities at all levels of healthcare delivery.

AB This documental, non-experimental and descriptive research has been developed for academic purposes in order to identify the main characteristics that promote the inclusive and sustainable development taking into account the relevance of the role of women in the economy.
   Until today the international community has not invested enough in matters of gender equality and this lack of financing has been a barrier to achieve the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals before 2015, and will be a barrier in order to achieve the Sustainable Developments goals from today to 2030. According to United Nations, only about 10% of official development assistance was allocated to investment in the advancement of women, but United Nations is not able to invest more without the assistance of the international community, especially the Group of 20 or the most important developed and developing countries.
   There are some guides in order to foster this financing, for example in countries as Costa Rica and Sri Lanka it has been reduced the military spending and security to assign those resources to social programs, including gender equality. This is why in this document is highlighted the relevance to promote sustainable development but it requires to give priority to investments that benefit women and ensure equal wages and access to opportunities among both genders.
   The objective of this research is to analyze the concept of inclusive and sustainable development, and according to the theoretical framework analyzed propose a strategy in order to promote inclusive growth, equity gender and sustainable development.

TI Stakeholder collaboration as a major factor for sustainable ecotourism
   development in developing countries
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB Ecotourism has been widely championed by academics and practitioners as a potential contributor of conservation and development. However, others have questioned whether sustainability goals can be achieved through this form of tourism. Of the various factors reported in the literature as hindering the success of ecotourism, the lack of effective stakeholder collaboration features prominently. This study draws upon stakeholder and collaboration theories and on triple-bottom-line principles, to investigate the contributions of stakeholder collaborations to sustainable ecotourism. The researchers adopted an exploratory research design and conducted stakeholder in-depth interviews and focus group discussions between 2016 and 2018. The findings revealed poor interactions and collaborations amongst ecotourism stakeholders. Consequently, ecotourism in Southern Ethiopia accelerates the degradation of natural resources, neglecting communities while benefiting other ecotourism stakeholders. Therefore, in poorly resourced and remote destinations, failure to empower and participate communities undermines ecotourism and jeopardizes the long-term survival of ecosystems and communities themselves.

TI Analysis of Islamic moral principles for sustainable economic
   development in developing society
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND
   MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose
   Economic development is one of the primary goals of all countries. In this context, countries aim to determine effective and correct policies to achieve this goal. This situation is especially important for developing countries. These countries aim to grow their economies to reach the level of developed countries. This study aims to identify significant Islamic moral principles for sustainable economic growth of emerging seven (E7) countries.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this framework, eight different criteria are defined to improve the welfare in the society for these countries. Additionally, fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach is taken into consideration in the analysis process.
   Findings
   It is identified that Islamic moral values in economic activities, fair income distribution and taxation and prohibition of interest and securing business partnership are the most significant criteria. On the other side, it is found that preventing poverty and avoiding wastage are the influenced factors.
   Practical implications
   The findings show that righteousness in commercial activities decreases uncertainty in the market so that trade volume can be increased which contributes sustainable economic improvement. For this purpose, public awareness about the issue should be improved in the media and necessary trainings should be given to the people in their educations related to the business ethics. Furthermore, legal system in these countries should be improved to have fair income distribution and taxation. Additionally, social responsibility activities should be encouraged, so people with good income will help poor people. Moreover, business partnership system should be improved in which companies can obtain capital from the public and make necessary payments to these people according to the profit amount. This issue positively affects sustainability in economic improvement and welfare society for developing countries.
   Originality/value
   There are limited studies on sustainable economic development based on Islamic moral-based factors.

TI A Game Analysis of Farmland Expropriation Conflict in China under
   Multi-Dimensional Preference: Cooperation or Resistance?
SO LAND
AB The process of urbanization in China has been accompanied by the conflict of land expropriation, which is not conducive to social stability. Different from the previous angles and methods of studying the conflict of agricultural land expropriation, this study puts forward a new behavioral perspective on the basis of game theory, and constructs an evolutionary game model of the conflict of agricultural land expropriation in China from the perspective of multi-dimensional preference. It also discusses the impact of different preference combinations on the conflict input, net income and utility of various stakeholders in agricultural land expropriation. The results show that under the influence of complete self-interest preference, the degree of protection of farmers' land rights and interests affects the probability of conflicts in compensation for agricultural land expropriation. However, under the influence of multi-dimensional preference combination, agricultural land expropriation can be carried out smoothly only when the reciprocal altruism preference of local government and farmers is strong and the loss aversion preference is weak. These insights have implications for the sustainable development of land, including government involvement and farmers participation, particularly in the context of developing countries.

SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB SWINGS was a cooperation project between the European Union and India, aiming at implementing state of the art low-cost technologies for the treatment and reuse of domestic wastewater in rural areas of India. The largest wastewater treatment plant consists of a high-rate anaerobic system, followed by vertical and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a treatment area of around 1,900 m(2) and a final step consisting of solar-driven anodic oxidation (AO) and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection units allowing direct reuse of the treated water. The implementation and operation of two pilot plants in north (Aligarh Muslim University, AMU) and central India (Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, IGNTU) are shown in this study. The overall performance of AMU pilot plant during the first 7 months of operation showed organic matter removal efficiencies of 87% total suspended solids, 95% 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and 90% chemical oxygen demand, while Kjeldahl nitrogen removal reached 89%. The UV disinfection unit produces water for irrigation and toilet flushing with pathogenic indicator bacteria well below WHO guidelines. On the other hand, the AO disinfection unit implemented at IGNTU and operated for almost a year has been shown to produce an effluent of sufficient quality to be reused by the local population for agriculture and irrigation.

SP Int Dairy Federat, Netherlands Natl Comm
AB An intervention study was undertaken for controlling mastitis in four different study groups: 1) selective dry cow therapy and improved hygiene, 2) improved hygiene and post milking teat dipping, 3) formation of 3 training groups of farmers in rural, peri-urban and urban herds in a modified Farmer Field School approach, and 4) a longitudinal study. Focus was made on effect of different control options on the occurrence of the disease, the economic benefits of the control options, and empowerment of the farmers. The purpose was to identify and recommend to farmers strategies to control mastitis, which are cost effective and easily adopted. The intervention study was carded out on 65 smallholder dairy farms with 153 lactating cows through qualitative, quantitative and microbiological methods for a period of 12 months. A participatory impact assessment (PIA) was carried out 12 months after intervention to determine the qualitative impact of the intervention project as perceived by the farmers. Overall the farmers ranked the benefits at household level as improved hygiene on the farms, reduced mastitis cases, increased cooperation with veterinarians, better access to mastitis control inputs, improved record keeping and increased milk production. The farmers perception after having used the strategies for a period of time was absolutely necessary in estimating and recommending strategies to the goat that they must be 'easily adopted and used by the small holder dairy farmers sustainably'.

TI Fulfilling Need for Neurosurgical Services in Sub-Saharan Africa:
   Initial Angola-Brazil Training Experience
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Although Africa accounts for 15% of the global volume of neurosurgical disease, African hospitals and health care networks have access to <1% of the neurosurgeon community. Health care and neurosurgical care are particularly scarce in sub-Saharan Africa due to long periods of imperialism, civil war, poverty, and famines that have plagued the area.
   METHODS: We provide a historical perspective and initial experience of the development of neurosurgery in Angola.
   RESULTS: The Republic of Angola has the seventh largest territory in Africa and a population of approximately 29 million people; however, it has a severe deficit of neurosurgery specialists. Between 1975 and 2012, only 5 neurosurgeons practiced in the country. We report the initial experience of the first Angolan physician who completed a full neurosurgical residency in Brazil through the Hospital das Clinicas-University of Sao Paulo Medical School international medical training program. The challenges of fulfilling the need for neurosurgical services and the future perspectives of building a sustainable program in Angola are discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partnerships between developing countries and sub-Saharan African countries may be the starting point in supplying neurosurgical specialists to the countries in need.

TI A multilevel evolutionary framework for sustainability analysis
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Sustainability theory can help achieve desirable social-ecological states by generalizing lessons across contexts and improving the design of sustainability interventions. To accomplish these goals, we argue that theory in sustainability science must (1) explain the emergence and persistence of social-ecological states, (2) account for endogenous cultural change, (3) incorporate cooperation dynamics, and (4) address the complexities of multilevel social-ecological interactions. We suggest that cultural evolutionary theory broadly, and cultural multilevel selection in particular, can improve on these fronts. We outline a multilevel evolutionary framework for describing social-ecological change and detail how multilevel cooperative dynamics can determine outcomes in environmental dilemmas. We show how this framework complements existing sustainability frameworks with a description of the emergence and persistence of sustainable institutions and behavior, a means to generalize causal patterns across social-ecological contexts, and a heuristic for designing and evaluating effective sustainability interventions. We support these assertions with case examples from developed and developing countries in which we track cooperative change at multiple levels of social organization as they impact social-ecological outcomes. Finally, we make suggestions for further theoretical development, empirical testing, and application.

TI Health research in the developing world: A gastroenterological view from
   Bangladesh
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
AB Ill health is a serious impediment to progress in must pour countries, yet health is not a high priority on foreign aid agendas. Health research, which provides the essential base for sustainable progressive health programs, is barely visible in developing countries. For example, in Bangladesh, one finds unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rates among infants and children, health programs that are struggling and a rudimentary health research establishment; for the huge foreign donor community in that country, health programs and research do not appear to warrant major investments, Diarrheal diseases are at the toy, of the list of killers in many poor nations including Bangladesh. Recent advances in our understanding of diarrhea suggest that while prevention may not he possible soon, improved active treatment can evolve from an aggressive research effort centred in a developing country and linked to appropriate international partners. Global agencies such as the World Health Organization have demonstrated a declining interest in health research, as reflected in the policies of their Diarrhoeal Disease Control Programme. Major donors ro the developing world, the Canadian International Development Agency for example, have had a relatively minor involvement in health and little commitment to health research. University links with the west, private enterprises and specially targeted programs are involved in developing world health. research but they have not been able to foster and leave behind sustainable, high quality research programs. The problem should be attacked directly by supporting focused, relevant health research centres in regions of the world where the burden of disease continues to impede progress and where the environment is conducive to high quality research that is well integrated with care delivery programs. An instructive model of this approach is the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

TI Mainstreaming and sector-wide approaches to sustainable energy access in
   Ethiopia
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB Access to modern and sustainable energy services is a real challenge for countries where the majority of rural population is living in austere poverty. The importance of sustainable energy access is recognized in many developing countries, and there is growing international development assistance in the sector. However the achievements are still meager particularly in Sub Saharan African countries. Most countries often fail to prioritize sustainable energy services at the local level as a means to achieve economic growth at the national level as well as the Millennium Development Goals. This study is focused on Ethiopia and investigates the existing challenges and future prospects of mainstreaming sustainable energy access into the development planning process of the country, and the implications this may have for international donor agencies, national policy makers, private actors and local energy planners. The paper analyzes the institutional framework, sector policy and financial mechanisms in the country. It also discusses operational modalities of state and non-state actors in the process, and extracts policy recommendations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Energy efficiency and thermal insulation code violations for residential
   buildings in Jordan and the role of social advocacy campaigns
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Compared to developed countries, developing countries' building codes are less enforceable for energy efficiency and minimum acceptable thermal insulation levels for building envelopes particularly. What leads to stronger compliance with such requirements is advancing not just policies, regulations, and enabling markets but also supportive non-governmental advocacy campaigns. The aim of such advocacies is raising awareness of overlooked energy-saving options in buildings and highlighting to policy-makers potential energy-efficiency and thermal-insulation codes' violations. This study presents a model research-based, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)-led advocacy supported by human rights defense-oriented tactics. It advocated for the overlooked right of the residents of Jordan in thermally-insulated housing and mitigating longtime walls' moisture, mold, thermal discomfort, and high energy bills. It is structured on a thoughtful, occupants-centered survey of 500 apartment buildings in the capital city, Amman. Aided by a ground-truthing Infrared thermography, we estimated the true percentage of the thermally-insulated units, which surprisingly amounted only 5.8 %, and documented evidence of high level of thermal-insulation code violation. Consequently, an investigative survey of roles and responsibilities of involved building sector's stakeholders, to identify root causes of code-enforcement failures, was systematically conducted. Based on findings of the two surveys, the social advocacy was launched to raise awareness and campaign for this violated "technical right", targeting regulatory entities to enact the legal and procedural rectifications needed. Consequently, this science-based, SCOs-led advocacy induced legal changes in the building-codes enforcement framework, which promotes involvement of SCOs in the national energy efficiency and sustainable development agenda.

TI Evaluation of the global implementation of the UNIDO-UNEP National
   Cleaner Production Centres (NCPC) Programme
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Since 1994 UNIDO and UNEP cooperate in a Programme to establish National Cleaner Production Centres (NCPCs) in developing and transition countries. An evaluation was conducted in 2007 when the Programme covered 37 countries. The programme evaluation was based on three information sources: a review of Programme strategy and management; self-evaluation by NCPC directors; and independent reviews of 18 NCPCs. It was found that NCPCs had been successful in putting Cleaner Production (CP) on the agenda of business and government, training of professional staff, implementation of low and intermediate technology options in assisted companies and policy change in some countries. An overall assessment was made on six assessment criteria: relevance; effectiveness; efficiency; sustainability; capacity development; and ownership. Limitations in articulation and implementation of the Programme strategy, the complexity of inter-agency cooperation and diversity among Programme countries globally, had a somewhat negative impact on the programme assessment, which was regardless on average satisfactory. It was concluded that the Programme had great potential, as relevance of CP was rising, due to worsening industrial pollution, resource scarcity, globalisation and resulting market pressure. The challenge remained to adapt to the changing interests and diversifying demands from governments and private sector globally.

AB e-Government Readiness Assessment is a vital step in developing effective e-Government strategies which provides important knowledge for policy- and decision-makers. Particularly for developing countries, it is imperative to analyse the conditions, opportunities and challenges of an existing environment to ensure that the resulting e-Government strategy is realistic and workable, whilst enabling public administration reform in support of a sustainable development agenda. While there are different approaches to e-Government Readiness Assessment, the review of existing literature reveals a general lack of focus on methodology and survey design for e-Government Readiness Assessment applicable to developing countries. In this paper, we present the key elements of a holistic e-Government Readiness Assessment methodology, considering national- and agency-level survey model and instrument design. In addition, we discuss implementation issues and present recommendations for future research including the validation of the proposed methodology.

SO DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB To achieve a top-to-bottom growth of the "green economy", incentives and enablers need to be identified for those micro enterprises working at the grassroots level. A three-year study of 1,300 social and environmental enterprises in developing countries reveals how they are developing new products and services for their communities, using new business models. But their scale-up is hampered by lack of access to research and technology support and gender barriers, as well as challenges with complex partnerships, progress monitoring, and financial viability. A large pool of innovative ideas remains untapped and an opportunity to build a sustainable economy is being missed.

TI Differential Treatment and Inequalities under the Sustainable
   Development Goals: Beyond Preferential Market Access
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Reducing inequality in its multiple dimensions is key to sustainability. Under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, one way to meet the goal of narrowing gaps between and within countries is by implementing the special and differential treatment (SDT) principle. The most concrete and well-established implementation of this principle within international trade law is through the Enabling Clause, which authorizes wealthy States to grant, under specified conditions, preferential market access to select developing countries. Yet commentators, consisting primarily of economists and developing-country representatives, argue that tariff preferences are often inadequate to grow the economies of many in the Global South, much less to reduce inequalities. A legal perspective that could bolster this argument remains sparse. This article fills said gap by explaining that while international trade law operationalizes the SDT principle with a heavy emphasis on tariff preferences, the principle is additionally expressed in several other provisions under the other World Trade Organization (WTO) covered agreements: Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade; Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; Agreement on Trade Facilitation. These under-studied provisions demonstrate crucial but overlooked aspects of the SDT principle, namely, capacity-building and international assistance and cooperation. Therefore, critically analyzing these provisions is important to ascertain whether and how implementation of the SDT principle can reduce inequalities and support sustainable development. This legal analysis contributes in two ways to the broader inquiry about the role of international trade law in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First, on a practical level, the article suggests legal bases or sources for additional indicators needed to better measure and monitor progress in reaching the target. Second, the analysis reveals a necessity to revisit and further scrutinize assumptions underlying the legal mechanisms within the trade regime that States and other relevant actors are using to pursue valuable global objectives.

TI American College of Clinical Pharmacy Global Health Practice and
   Research Network's opinion paper: Pillars for global health engagement
   and key engagement strategies for pharmacists
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
AB The scope of pharmacy practice in global health has expanded over the past decade creating additional education and training opportunities for students, residents and pharmacists. There has also been a shift from short-term educational and clinical experiences to more sustainable bidirectional partnerships between high-income countries (HICs) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). As more institutional and individual partnerships between HICs and LMICs begin to form, it is clear that there is a lack of guidance for pharmacists on how to build meaningful, sustainable, and mutually beneficial programs. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance for pharmacists in HICs to make informed decisions on global health partnerships and identify opportunities for engagement in LMICs that yield mutually beneficial collaborations. This paper uses the foundations of global health principles to identify five pillars of global health engagement when developing partnerships: (a) sustainability, (b) shared leadership, (c) mutually beneficial partnerships, (d) local needs-based care and (e) host-driven experiential and didactic education. Finally, this paper highlights ways pharmacists can use the pillars as a framework to engage and support health care systems, collaborate with academic institutions, conduct research, and interface with governments to improve health policy.

TI Toward a global space exploration program: A stepping stone approach
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB In response to the growing importance of space exploration in future planning, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Panel on Exploration (PEX) was chartered to provide independent scientific advice to support the development of exploration programs and to safeguard the potential scientific assets of solar system objects. In this report, PEX elaborates a stepwise approach to achieve a new level of space cooperation that can help develop world-wide capabilities in space science and exploration and support a transition that will lead to a global space exploration program. The proposed stepping stones are intended to transcend cross-cultural barriers, leading to the development of technical interfaces and shared legal frameworks and fostering coordination and cooperation on a broad front. Input for this report was drawn from expertise provided by COSPAR Associates within the international community and via the contacts they maintain in various scientific entities. The report provides a summary and synthesis of science roadmaps and recommendations for planetary exploration produced by many national and international working groups, aiming to encourage and exploit synergies among similar programs. While science and technology represent the core and, often, the drivers for space exploration, several other disciplines and their stakeholders (Earth science, space law, and others) should be more robustly interlinked and involved than they have been to date. The report argues that a shared vision is crucial to this linkage, and to providing a direction that enables new countries and stakeholders to join and engage in the overall space exploration effort. Building a basic space technology capacity within a wider range of countries, ensuring new actors in space act responsibly, and increasing public awareness and engagement are concrete steps that can provide a broader interest in space exploration, worldwide, and build a solid basis for program sustainability. By engaging developing countries and emerging space nations in an international space exploration program, it will be possible to create a critical bottom-up support structure to support program continuity in the development and execution of future global space exploration frameworks. With a focus on stepping stones, COSPAR can support a global space exploration program that stimulates scientists in current and emerging spacefaring nations, and that will invite those in developing countries to participate-pursuing research aimed at answering outstanding questions about the origins and evolution of our solar system and life on Earth (and possibly elsewhere). COSPAR, in cooperation with national and international science foundations and space-related organizations, will advocate this stepping stone approach to enhance future cooperative space exploration efforts.

TI Measuring policy coherence on global access to clean energy between

SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB Amongst the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring energy access in developing countries while reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases is critical. To achieve such goals, international cooperation combined with investments in research, technology, infrastructures and capacity building are paramount. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on access to affordable and clean energy, includes both targets at the domestic and international stages of energy policy. However, trade-offs are emerging in the monitoring phase of SDG7 and its targets, signalling the need for stronger coherence at all stages. Here, we assess to what extent policy coherence exists, and is or is not maintained, considering internal and external energy policy in Europe. We find that a higher level of coherence exists in internal than external energy policy. This result questions the overall positive contribution and commitment of European countries when it comes to facilitating energy access in developing countries. The results also highlight the positive effect of common policy frameworks and the need to rely more extensively on new means for governing and improving international policy coherence. We identify key trade-offs and co-benefits to be addressed for achieving improved policy coherence and call for a common framework that unifies internal and external energy policy in Europe for accelerating progress towards global access to clean energy.

TI The effectiveness of fisheries subsidies as a trade policy tool to
   achieving sustainable development goals at the WTO
SO MARINE POLICY
AB At the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Argentina, despite being steadfast in achieving an outcome on fisheries subsidies disciplines, member countries were unable to reach consensus on the matter. While members of the WTO have been advocating for sustainable management of fisheries resources and advocating the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6, some developing countries were concerned about its impact on low income and poorly resourced fishers, who are surviving because of the subsidies under the discipline. This study provides possible implications of the fisheries subsidies as a trade policy tool for market access and its effectiveness in achieving the overall sustainable development goals. To examine the effectiveness of subsidies in fisheries negotiations, the study focuses on the global supply and demand side of the fisheries resources from the perspective of the fish resource holders and the fishing resource capacity. The analysis considers budgetary support in fisheries, the vessel capacity (tonnage), the fish development technologies and the total marine catch processing, to indicate the demand for extraction of the fish resources. The supply of the fish resources is determined by the regions with major fishing areas and the licenses issued for fishing. Using both the market demand and supply for fisheries resource extraction, the study examines the effectiveness of subsidies as a trade policy tool to attain the overall sustainable development goals. Based on the analysis, certain policy strategies follows, which are Important for countries to consider before the elimination of fisheries subsidies at the WTO.

AB In response to the global effort to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, a partnership was created between the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to establish the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (Global Network) in 2000. The Global Network was developed with a goal of building local maternal and child health research capacity in resource-poor settings. The objective of the network was to conduct research focused on several high-need areas, such as preventing life-threatening obstetric complications, improving birth weight and infant growth, and improving childbirth practices in order to reduce mortality. Scientists from developing countries, together with peers in the USA, lead research teams that identify and address population needs through randomized clinical trials and other research studies. Global Network projects develop and test cost-effective, sustainable interventions for pregnant women and newborns and provide guidance for national policy and for the practice of evidence-based medicine. This article reviews the results of the Global Network's research, the impact on policy and practice, and highlights the capacity-building efforts and collaborations developed since its inception.

TI Categorizing the telehealth policy response of countries and their
   implications for complementarity of telehealth policy
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH
AB Developing countries are exploring the role of telehealth to overcome the challenges of providing adequate health care services. However, this process faces disparities, and no complementarity in telehealth policy development. Telehealth has the potential to transcend geopolitical boundaries, yet telehealth policy developed in one jurisdiction may hamper applications in another. Understanding such policy complexities is essential for telehealth to realize its full global potential. This study investigated 12 East Asian countries that may represent a microcosm of the world, to determine if the telehealth policy response of countries could be categorized, and whether any implications could be identified for the development of complementary telehealth policy. The countries were Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Three categories of country response were identified in regard to national policy support and development. The first category was "None" (Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam) where international partners, driven by humanitarian concerns, lead telehealth activity. The second category was "Proactive" (China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) where national policies were designed with the view that telehealth initiatives are a component of larger development objectives. The third was "Reactive" (Hong Kong and Japan), where policies were only proffered after telehealth activities were sustainable. It is concluded that although complementarity of telehealth policy development is not occurring, increased interjurisdictional telehealth activity, regional clusters, and concerted and coordinated effort amongst researchers, practitioners, and policy makers may alter this trend.

TI Public-private partnerships as investment models for water
   infrastructure in South Africa
SO INFRASTRUCTURE ASSET MANAGEMENT
AB Developing countries, such as South Africa, have no choice but to look at innovative and/or alternative approaches, such as public-private partnerships (PPP) as investment models, to ensure that they eliminate their water infrastructure backlogs. The primary objectives for the research were: (i) to develop a PPP framework; (ii) the identification of PPP investment models for water infrastructure; and (iii) to determine key categories, criteria, and characteristics for cost-effective PPP investment models to ensure the sustainability of the water infrastructure value chain in South Africa. The framework for PPPs identified five broad categories of investment models for water infrastructure value chain in South Africa. The research results highlight the aspects of PPP in addressing i) water infrastructure needs; ii) implementation strategy for water infrastructure projects; iii) investment policies; and iv) for the eradication of water infrastructure backlogs. The total investment estimates in the past 20-year period (1998/1999 - 2019/20) have been ca. US$48.36 billion with the public sector contributed ca. US$44.32 billion (91.64%) and the private sector only US$4.04 billion (8.36%). Furthermore, the analysis exemplified that ca. US$2.75 billion/annum is available based on the current financial arrangements leaving a finance gap of US$2.83 billion/annum in the water infrastructure value chain.

TI Research, development and scaling-up the adoption of fodder shrub
   innovations in East Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Smallholder farmers in developing countries face numerous limitations that hinder them from embracing improved agricultural practices and innovations with great potential for meaningful transformations of livelihoods. Consequently, farmers continue living in vicious cycles of poverty despite decades of government and donor expenditures on poverty alleviation. In the last two decades, research and development organizations collaborated in testing and validating selected fodder shrub species as reliable sources of less expensive and easily available protein feeds. With minimal interventions, the research findings have great potential to improve productivity for many smallholder farmers. Tested species include Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena spp., Chamaecytisus palmensis, Sesbania sesban, Morus alba and Gliricidia sepium. Dissemination and adoption surveys estimated that 205,000 smallholder farmers (40-50 per cent being women) had planted fodder shrubs by 2005. Currently, fodder shrubs contribute US$3.8 million annually to farmers' incomes and estimated potential annual income is US$81 million. Factors associated with success in fodder scaling-up include deliberate involvement of fodder technology champions, collective action in community mobilization and project implementation, pluralistic extension approaches, sustainable germplasm supply systems, broader partnerships and civil society campaigns. Constraints and challenges include: ineffective delivery of extension and research services, inhibitive policies, political interferences, frequent droughts and inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems.

TI Social Responsibility Initiatives for Public-Private Partnership
   Projects: A Comparative Study between China and Ghana
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainability is a global issue and its enhancement through modern forms of procurements, such as public-private partnership (PPP), has become topical considering the huge impact of PPP activities on society, the economy, and the environment. However, one way of promoting sustainability thorough PPPs is the adoption of social responsibility (SR) initiatives/factors. This paper aims to empirically investigate the SR factors in PPPs through a comparative study between China and Ghana. An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted in both China and Ghana. Further, the mean score ranking, Kendall's coefficient of concordance, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis. Results show that SR factors related to the economic efficiency of PPP projects and climate change adaptation are critical in China, whereas in Ghana, SR factors directly related to job creation and environmental protection are critical. The outputs of this study inform investors of the critical SR initiatives to consider when engaging in PPPs in Asia and Africa. In addition, they provide a solid knowledge base for the continuous international debate on how sustainability could be enhanced through PPP policy.

AB Participatory methods are a key element in the approach to agricultural development known as Farming Systems Research (FSR). The approach has evolved in developing countries over 20 years, but until recently, FSR has received only token support in developed countries. Recent interest in FSR in Australia has focused mainly on technology adoption, whilst participatory approaches have also been embraced by the "Landcare" movement. In neither case has there been any consistent emphasis on research to advance scientific understanding or develop new technology.
   This paper describes a new approach to FSR in Australia, prompted by the need to develop and employ farming practices which are demonstrably sustainable.
   Farming systems research is conceived of as a learning or innovation system, in which researchers, farmers and farm advisers, collaborate in the continuous improvement of farming systems to achieve twin goals of profitability and sustainability.
   Farmers in the northern grain-growing region of Australia, and the Australian Government, have each committed over $4 million to an FSR program based on the principles outlined here. The paper describes the theoretical basis for the program and its operational management, as well as outlining the difficulties encountered in implementing the plan.

AB This paper explores the intermediary roles that public policies can play in order to stimulate government agencies, businesses, and civil societies to engage effectively in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda in a non-western context. The framework of public policy roles in promoting CSR by Fox et al. [1], consisting of four attributes (mandating, facilitating, partnering, and endorsing) is referred to in this paper. Although the role of empowerment is not one of the four roles identified by Fox et al. [1], the literature places emphasis on the importance of empowering different actors in implementing the CSR agenda. Thus, a fifth role, the role of empowerment, is introduced along with the other four. The outcome of this research can help policymakers construct a clearer image of the present status of CSR public policies and expand the scope for creating an environment that enables CSR. Having said that, the enabling environment for CSR in a non-western context is in need of deeper understanding and investigation. The role of the public policies to foster more sustainable and effective engagement in the CSR planning and implementation processes in developing countries constitutes a scope for future exploration.

TI Broadening the Global Development Framework Post 2015: Embracing Policy
   Coherence and Global Public Goods
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB With the 21 targets of the Millennium Development Goals and the 0.7 per cent of gross national income target for Official Development Assistance coming to an end, 2015 represents an opportunity to update and broaden the global development reporting framework to strengthen the global effort to reduce poverty in developing countries. This article proposes a three-pillar approach to monitor the post-2015 progress based on traditional development outcomes, policy coherence for development indicators and global public goods. Through an analytical framework, the desirability, feasibility and political acceptability of the approach are assessed. The article finds that any perceived technical challenges could be overcome but that the willingness of more affluent countries to have their contributions monitored is likely to be the key stumbling block.

TI Adopters and Non-Adopters of Low-Cost Household Latrines: A Study of
   Corbelled Pit Latrines in 15 Districts of Malawi
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Sustainable Development Goals will challenge low-and middle-income settings to look at new approaches for rural sanitation. In 2013, Mzuzu University, in partnership with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Malawi, started a low-cost latrine program in rural areas using the corbelled latrine design supported by locally owned sustainable businesses. The objective of this work was to trace customers (early household adopters) and non-customers through field observations and interviews in 15 districts of Malawi. The research team spent 193 personnel work days in data collection and found 21 households as adopters in 7 districts. Most respondents had a preference with regard to the design of the sanitation facility they would like to use. Although sharing of sanitation facilities was common, the corbelled latrine is promoted as a single household pit latrine design. Unfortunately, 8% (23/ 304) of non-adopters responded they practiced open defecation. Households were satisfied with the corbelled latrine design, and no latrine was found to have collapsed during field visits. To promote the corbelled latrine in Malawi, the following are recommended: (1) education of frontline government extension workers towards non-subsidized household latrines; (2) identification of rural low-income households as the best target for potential adopters; and (3) linkage of low-cost sanitation technologies to community mobilization campaigns led by the government, such as Community Led Total Sanitation.

TI Challenges facing sustainable water supply, sanitation and hygiene

SO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Better water supply, sanitation and hygiene systems are among the sustainable development goals which need to be achieved by 2030. However, it is challenging for developing countries especially sub-Saharan Africa to achieve sustainable sanitation and hygiene. Thus, a systematic review has been conducted to provide a deep discussion of the current and previous works on challenges facing sanitation and hygiene sector in SSA countries. The results indicate that lack of financial resources, rapid population increase, socioeconomic disparities among the urban inhabitants, topography, lack of skilled, and experienced personnel, inadequate policies and strategies, and people's behaviours and attitudes were identified as the main constraints to sustainable sanitation and hygiene in SSA. Moreover, it recommended that SSA countries can achieve sustainable sanitation and hygiene if there are political commitments, an increase of education and awareness on sanitation to the community, and cooperation among the government, non-government organisations, civil societies, and communities in addressing the issues of sanitation. These efforts will lead to enhanced and improved sanitation and hygiene services in the SSA region.

TI Inclusive municipal solid waste management policy in Nigeria: engaging
   the informal economy in post-2015 development agenda
SO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The problem of municipal solid waste has remained intractable in Nigeria despite the state's central role in municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Policy and reforms of the MSWM system have invariably excluded the informal economy, with this exclusion frequently reinforced by uncritical implementation of neo-liberal development policies. Yet, the informal economy fortuitously remains active in solid waste collection, recycling, and disposal. This article is the aggregate outcome of an 8-year multi-stakeholder engagement in MSWM in Nigerian cities. It draws on insights from first-hand qualitative engagement with informal waste workers, interviews with key stakeholders, policy documents, and relevant literature to situate the Nigerian informal waste economy within current international development discourse. While highlighting the implications of social acceptance and inclusion of the waste economy in post-2015 MSWM and development policy, the study notes the lack of an articulate policy on MSWM in Nigeria and canvasses a specific policy to integrate the ubiquitous informal waste economy in MSWM. The paper suggests that inclusion per se is central to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and argues that an inclusive MSWM policy in Nigeria is desirable as it maps onto the SDGs which aim to improve lives in the post-2015 development era.

TI FACTORS INFLUENCING THE USE OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION IN TANZANIAN LOCAL
   GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES (LGAS): AN INSTITUTIONAL THEORY APPROACH
SO PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING, ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITING IN EMERGING
   ECONOMIES
SE Research in Accounting in Emerging Economies
AB Purpose - This paper seeks to establish the influence of several types of factors on the use of accounting information in the public sector within a developing country context. Institutional theory with its branches NIS and OIE underlies the theoretical framework for explaining the factors influencing the use of accounting information. The analysis was based on structural equation modelling to test nine hypotheses. The data were collected by administering 208 questionnaires to the Tanzanian Local Government Authorities' political and administrative actors.
   Findings - At large, the findings of this study comprehend the role of institutionalised social and legal rule with professionalism in shaping actors to use accounting information instrumentally and symbolically in budget decision-making processes. Furthermore, the findings establish the importance of education and experiences on accounting and financial aspects of the actors who are involved in the public sector budget decision-making process. The findings also provide an understanding of the differences between political actors and administrative actors in terms of the factors influencing the symbolic use of accounting information in LGA's decision-making processes.
   Practical implication - Our findings challenge development partners (i.e. donors), reformers such as Central Government and National Accounting professional board such NBAA in Tanzania to coerce pressure by adoption of implementation of NPM techniques, which can lead to positive change in LGAs to influence instrumental rather than symbolic use of accounting information in the budgetary decision-making processes. For example, adoption of accrual basis accounting should also concur with the improvement of accounting information systems, legal and regulatory frameworks together with creation of trainings that increase skill and knowledge of using accounting information by the actors. This might ensure financial sustainability to LGAs that can increase provision of service with relevant quality to citizens. Moreover, the findings need the political parties to take responsibility of building capacity of their candidates. It might ensure that their representatives in the council are capable of making appropriate use of the accounting information at their disposal to improve the quality of budget decision making and their representation of the population for the benefit of their organisation and eventually of their political parties. The citizens are needed to be sources of professional behaviours to both councillors and administrators by making closer follow up and demands of quality services from their LGAs through budgeting processes.
   Research limitations - The generalisation of this study's findings can be limited because they were obtained only from LGAs operating in Tanzania
   Original/value - This is the first paper that establishes the factors influencing the instrumental-conceptual use and the symbolic use of accounting information in LGAs' budgetary decision-making processes in developing country context, in particular, in Tanzania.

TI RESHAPING AN ASYMMETRICAL PARTNERSHIP: ACP-EU RELATIONS FROM AN ACP
   PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and the European Union (EU) have engaged in what is known as a special privileged', legally binding contractual agreement on trade cooperation, development assistance and political dialogue since 1975. Currently expressed in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement for a 20-year period from 2000, the agreement faces its final 5-year review in 2015, which is proving conducive for an extensive debate between development practitioners on what future can be envisaged for ACP-EU relations in a world drastically different from the neocolonial era of the 1970s and offering new opportunities as well as challenges to trade, commerce and development assistance. From the perspective of a diplomatic representative of an ACP member state, a critique is offered of issues and instances in which the contested interests of the asymmetrical relationship can be interpreted in relation to the overarching objective of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty' as stated in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. The author argues that the ACP Group, as the unique, transcontinental coalition of developing countries can be a significant partner with the EU and new actors', through south-south and triangular cooperations to challenge traditional thinking and practice on development assistance by a thoroughly refashioned paradigm, in which equality, sustainability, inclusive growth and structural transformation of ACP economies must be pre-eminent.

TI Drivers of rural-urban migration and impact on food security in rural
   Tanzania
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB This paper contributes to (1) the Valletta action plan by identifying root causes of migration in Africa, and (2) the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda reflecting the close links between migration and development. Our objectives are to identify drivers of rural-urban migration in Tanzania and to examine its impact on food security. The analyses are based on survey data of 900 rural households in the Dodoma and Morogoro districts of Tanzania from 2013. The logistic regression revealed that several household characteristics such as age of the household head, household size, and dependency ratio, but also employment and welfare status determine whether any household member migrates from the rural area to an urban area. Households from the more remote and food insecure Dodoma district were more likely to have migrants looking for jobs than households from Morogoro district. The Propensity Score Matching approach revealed that migration significantly worsens the food security status of rural migrant households in terms of access, availability and stability. This outcome is explained by the loss in labor input, leading to lower agricultural productivity of rural households, which cannot be compensated by the transfer of remittances from their respective migrants. Thus, migration does not always function as a pathway out of food insecurity in developing countries.

CY SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008
CL Wilmington, DE
AB The neglected tropical diseases or 'NTDs' represent the most common infections of the world's one billion poorest people. Unlike the better known acute or emerging infections, the NTDs are generally chronic and disabling (and often disfiguring) conditions. The long-term disability they cause has been revealed as a major reason why poor people in developing countries cannot escape the poverty trap. Because NTDs are associated with poverty, vaccines against these conditions are sometimes referred to as antipoverty vaccines. However, despite their global public health and economic importance, such vaccines have largely been ignored by industry and today are predominantly being produced through the activities of non-profit product development partnerships (PDPs). The Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative based at the Sabin Vaccine Institute is one such PDP developing two antipoverty vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis, respectively. It has been proposed to combine these vaccines in order to target polyparasitic co-infections leading to severe anemia. Ultimately, to ensure global access of a multivalent anthelminthic vaccine, it may be linked to deworming programs through vaccine-linked chemotherapy. This would be an important step towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals for sustainable poverty reduction by 2015. (C) 2009 The International Association for Biologicals.

TI Common but Differentiated Commitments China's Engagement with the 2030
   Agenda Global Partnership
SO CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES
AB Since the basic framework of the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals (SDGs) was created, the focal point of relevant discussions has been shifted to global partnership and implementation. As a key component of this development initiative, global partnership has the potential to determine the means of implementation and follow-up implementation of the 2030 agenda, to which China is expected to make greater contributions. China's participation in global partnership will definitely generate benefits and incur costs. On one hand, the continuing rise of China could lead to future shrinkage of physical gains, leaving enormous potential for augmenting non-physical gains. On the other hand, the rest of the world expects China to contribute more global public goods in physical terms but not necessarily intellectual ones. With regard to cost-benefit balance, the costs of China's involvement in global partnership will be greater than the benefits it generates, while its non-physical gains will be hard to assess due to many uncertainties. For China, as a developing country, to contribute further to global partnership for the 2030 agenda, it should make clear strategic commitments on multilateral platforms, promise concrete material assistance at bilateral (collective) forums, and deepen its comprehensive domestic reforms.

TI The impact of internal and external green supply chain management
   activities on performance improvement: evidence from the automobile
   industry
SO HELIYON
AB Although the significance of green supply chain management activities on corporation sustainable development has been highlighted in the literature, the potential inter-dependencies between these activities and corporation performance have not been investigated by considering cooperation moderation. The purpose of this research is to examine internal and external Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) activity on automobile performance: Environmental performance, operational performance, positive economic performance, and negative economic performance. Using survey data from foreign-owned company A with 117 manufacturing firms and domestic company B with 94 manufacturing firms, a significant relationship between GSCM and corporation performance has been found. For foreign-owned automobile companies, internal organizational activity has the greatest in-fluence on operational performance, and promotes corporate value and corporation with outside. However, for domestic automobile companies with the advanced green concept, Eco-design exerts the biggest effect on envi-ronmental performance, and also brought a negative economic impact on corporate performance. Moreover, although both corporate social responsibility (CSR) and creating shared value (CSV) promotion could influence the corporation with consumers and suppliers, CSV promotion has a more positive influence on cooperation with consumers than that CSR. These findings have important implications for designing GSCM strategic plans for the automotive industry in developing countries.

TI Nationwide policymaking strategies to prevent future electricity crises
   in developing countries using data-driven forecasting and fuzzy-SWOT
   analyses
SO ENERGY
AB Over the past decades, forecasting electricity demand has been crucial in energy planning and power distribution management to establish sustainable strategies in undeveloped countries. This work proposes an integrated approach to evaluate Pakistan's energy sector and holistically investigate electricity-load strategies to prioritize them and prevent future electricity crises. This paper proposes a renewable energy technologies-based system design to eliminate energy shortfalls. Deep learning models can predict fluctuating variation in energy con-sumption, crucial for designing renewable energy systems. The strengths - weaknesses - opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis identified relevant factors and sub-factors, while the fuzzy-TOPSIS methodology prioritized alternative strategies. The results show that driving the nation to the functionality of an energy hub by sufficiently using its geostrategic location within the regional cooperation framework is the critical dominant factor. Besides, improving the country's investment environment was the least favored priority. Baluchistan was found to have the highest potential for wind energy, with an ability to generate 3270 MWh/year through wind power.

TI Trade and sustainability: Three decades of change across Africa
SO AFRICA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB Macro-level sustainability indicators have declined for African countries over the last three decades both in absolute terms and relative to non-African countries. Over these same years, trade relations for African exporters have changed significantly in terms of products exported as well as trade partners involved. In this paper, we explore several indicators that may link these changes in trade to the decline in sustainable development across Africa. We create a novel longitudinal dataset that combines specific configurations of products exported to different types of trade partners with country-level sustainability outcomes. We use time series models to identify which of these indicators are significantly associated with sustainability for African countries and compare those to the predominant viewpoints of African development such as the natural resource curse and the call for greater African self-reliance. We find an interesting set of non-results that contradict several common viewpoints, but we find a significant negative association between intra-African supply chain development and lower sustainability. Our results support firm-state development planning by identifying sector-partner configurations linked to sustainability outcomes across Africa as well as future firm-level work to consider how firms headquartered outside of developing countries may address sustainability.

AB As computing education grows rapidly across the globe, there is an increasing need to broaden participation and engage all students in computing, particularly those from underrepresented groups and developing countries. A programming workshop that uses various interventions to broaden participation was set up to empower African university students with computer programming skills to address this need. Out of 487 applications, 172 participants from 11 African countries were selected to participate in the workshop. This paper aims to explore the participants' experiences, including their motivation for attending the workshop, their programming skills confidence, what they found most useful for their learning, and the challenges they faced. Employing a mixed-methods design, our quantitative and qualitative results indicate that participants' motivations were more intrinsic. Furthermore, the results indicate that participants' confidence increased after the workshop. They found the hands-on sessions with the tutors to be most beneficial to their learning. We also observed that many participants struggled with access to basic ICT resources during the workshop, even though they were provided with the internet. Our findings highlight that participants are interested in learning programming; therefore, to support them, sustainable collaborative partnerships are necessary to provide relevant teaching interventions and resources.

TI Government subsidy strategy for public-private-partnership retrofit
   buildings in China
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB To reduce energy consumption, governments have introduced public-private partnerships in energy efficient retrofits (PPP-EER) of existing public buildings. However, this initiative has received a mixed response from private investors. Government investment subsidies effectively attract private investors, but the current literature does not specify how to choose an appropriate subsidy strategy. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a new and reasonable subsidy strategy for promoting immediate investment and sustainable implementation of PPP-EER projects from a government perspective. Real option theory was adopted to simulate and evaluate the subsidy strategy in PPP-EER projects. The results of the simulation show that the deferred option has a significant impact on the project value and helps attract immediate private investment. Subsidies should be implemented according to certain retrofit measures. This research is the first attempt to calculate the project deferred option value in a subsidised PPP-EER project and improves knowledge of government subsidy strategies. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the European Union's
   development assistance
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of mainstreaming efforts regarding climate change adaptation (CCA) in EU development cooperation. By constructing and operationalising an analytical framework capable of tracing the level of mainstreaming throughout different phases of the policy cycle, we provide an answer to the question 'what works and what doesn't' in the integration of climate change in development cooperation. We combine a document analysis with semi-structured expert interviews, encompassing both HQ level in Brussels as well as EU aid activities in nine different developing countries. Our findings indicate that the Commission envisions a harmonisation approach towards CCA mainstreaming, targeting aid activities related to sustainable agriculture, food security and rural development. Although the toolbox for mainstreaming allows for a prioritisation of CCA, the procedural approach is currently ineffective due to limited staff and mainstreaming fatigue. In contrast, the growing political salience of CCA mainstreaming can be considered the main driver of mainstreaming efforts in the Commission.

TI International HIV and AIDS prevention: Japan United States collaboration
SO JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES AND HUMAN RETROVIROLOGY
AB As the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS pandemic shifts from Africa to Asia, Japan is becoming ever more aware of the importance of containing and preventing spread of the virus. International collaboration, particularly with the United States, is a logical approach because it allows utilization of expertise from countries in other stages of the pandemic, can prevent duplication of efforts, and complements efforts of the other countries. Further, both Japan and the United States can use their combined influence and prestige to encourage cooperation among all nations. In 1994, Japan established the Global Issues Initiative to extend cooperation to developing countries in the areas of population and AIDS control. It has disbursed more than $460 million (U.S.$) to promote active cooperation and stimulate international attention to the importance of addressing these health issues. Japan has established four main programs for international collaboration for control of HIV and AIDS, three operated by ministries and one by a Japanese nongovernmental organization. Japanese/United States collaboration is developing through the United States/Japan Cooperative Medical Sciences Program, the Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective, the Paris Summit, and the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS. It is critical that Japan and the United States, as the two largest donors to international development, demonstrate, through their collaboration, ways to maximize the use of limited resources, reduce duplication, and promote sustainable development programs in which HIV prevention and AIDS care programs are systemically integrated.

TI Exploring constraining factors for use of private sector finance in
   delivery of public sector infrastructure in Tanzania: A qualitative
   study
SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB While governments remain accountable for the delivery of infrastructure services, given the paucity of public resources, studies have recommended the use of private sector finance (PSF) as an alternative approach to delivering sustainable infrastructure both in developed and developing economies. Despite the recommendation, there has been very little use of PSF in delivering public projects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study explores the constraining factors for the use of PSF in the delivery of public infrastructure in Tanzania and proposes recommendations. A total of 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with different stakeholders delivering public infrastructure services. Interviewees were purposefully selected. Data were analyzed through conceptual content analysis. The findings reveal that the top five constraining factors were inadequate knowledge and skills, lack of policy to support or suffice PSF, bureaucracy or delays of approvals, lack of proper models for PSF, and lack of skilled people or existence of a big national skill gap. Thus, the identified constraints provided useful insights and were used as a road map for suggesting appropriate solutions to enhance the use of PSF. Furthermore, this is the first study to empirically explore the constraining factors for PSF in delivering infrastructure projects in the Tanzanian context.

TI Public-Private Sector Involvement in Providing Efficient Solid Waste
   Management Services in Nigeria
SO RECYCLING
AB This paper reviews the partnership between the public and the private sectors in providing efficient solid waste management (SWM) services. While the responsibility of providing SWM services lies with the public sector, the sector has not been able to meet the demand for efficient service delivery, especially in developing countries. In a bid to increase efficiency and lower costs incurred in rendering these services, the involvement of the private sector has been sought. With a focus on major Nigerian cities, partnerships between the local government and private operators in SWM have been analysed based on the level to which the partnership has improved the SWM services. This paper provides an understanding that the success of any public-private partnership relies on the extent to which all stakeholders perform their duties. If the public sector is slack in monitoring and supervising the activities of the private operators, the latter may focus on profit generation while neglecting efficient service delivery. Also, legislation is an important part of SWM. Without the right legislation and enforcement, waste generators will not be mandated to dispose their waste properly. The public sector as a facilitator is responsible for creating an environment for private operators to function, particularly through legislation, enforcement and public sensitization.

TI United States of America Department of Health and Human Services support
   for advancing influenza vaccine manufacturing in the developing world
SO VACCINE
AB Since 2005, the Government of the United States of America has provided more than US$ 50 million to advance influenza vaccine development in low-resourced countries. This programme has provided a unique opportunity for the US Government to develop a comprehensive view of, and to understand better the challenges and future needs for influenza vaccines in the developing world. The funding for this programme has been primarily through a cooperative agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) to support directly its capacity-building grants to government-owned or -supported vaccine manufacturers in developing countries. A second cooperative agreement with the Program for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH) was initiated to accelerate the completion of a current Good Manufacturing Practice cGMP production facility, along with supporting facilities to obtain a reliable source of eggs, and to conduct clinical trials of influenza vaccine manufactured in Vietnam. This mechanism of utilizing cooperative agreements to support capacity-building for vaccine development in low-resourced settings has been novel and unique and has yielded fruitful returns on minimal investment.
   The information derived from this programme helps to clarify not only the development challenges for influenza vaccines and how the United States may assist in meeting those challenges, but also other vaccine development issues common to manufacturers in developing countries. While building the initial capacity to produce influenza vaccines can be a straightforward exercise, the sustainability of the enterprise and expansion of subsequent markets will be the key to future usefulness. There is hope for expansion of the global influenza vaccine market. Ongoing burden of disease studies are elucidating the impact of influenza infections, particularly in children, and more countries will take note and respond accordingly, since respiratory diseases are now the number one killer of children under five years of age.
   In addition to achievements described in this issue of Vaccine, the programme has been successful from the US perspective because the working relationships established between the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and its partners have assisted in advancing influenza vaccine development at many different levels. A few examples of BARDA's support include: establishment of egg-based influenza vaccine production from "scratch", enhancement of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) production techniques and infrastructure, completion of fill/finish operations for imported bulk vaccine, and training in advanced bio-manufacturing techniques.
   These HHS-supported programmes have been well-received internationally, and we and our partners hope the successes will stimulate even more interest within the international community in maximizing global production levels for influenza vaccines. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN AFRICA
AB The extractive industry gets huge international consideration because of the way they discharge their ecological and social obligations. Despite the fact that mining sector ventures have numerous points of interest, wrong mining operations have prompted emotional environment and resources exhaustion. To accomplish a parity of such operations, sustainable programs are an absolute necessity and ought to be trailed by the business. Of the different feasible practices, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) has picked up conspicuousness as of late. The developed nations, CSR is at a propelled level, yet in emerging economies particularly in Africa, CSR is in a preparatory stage, because of both known and obscure reasons. This study researches drivers for CSR usage in the mining business in Ghana, a developing country in Africa. A few studies concentrated on CSR issues however were constrained to industrial points of view without considering multi-partners. This paper endeavors to bridge the gap by dissecting CSR drivers from the viewpoints of numerous stakeholders, including media, government and social organizations. The researchers propose a model system, showed with a contextual investigation from a Ghana Investments Promotion Center (GIPC). In light of these findings, businesses can build their chances of honing quality CSR in modern business behaviors. This research augments the extent of this issue through changing multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) apparatuses and distinctive situations, for example, dim, fluffy, and different methodologies. The extra drivers can likewise be accepted with statistical interpretations.

TI Training Program for Vitreoretinal Surgery in Nairobi, Kenya from
   2000-2005
SO KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB Background: After the U.S. Embassy bombing in 1998 in Nairobi, Kenya, a relief operation was immediately initiated by the Department of Ophthalmology of the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) Munich, Germany. Surgical devices and material (such as a vitrectomy unit, silicon oil, perfluordecalin, intraocular lenses, sutures) were supplied to operate on 42 ocular-injured victims of this bombing attack. Apart from these specific operations in Kenya, there is a big need for vitreoretinal surgery in East Africa, as in all other developing countries. Therefore, a vitreoretinal training program was started in 2000 in Nairobi, Kenya. We report about the first 7 years of collaboration between the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Germany and the University of Nairobi in cooperation with the Kenyatta National Hospital, Kenya.
   Material and Methods: The training program was based on an annual project week in which the author (CLS) carried out vitreoretinal surgery himself and assisted and supervised surgery done by the local Kenyan colleagues at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Within the observation period of the present work (2000-2006) the following data were collected: number and kind of surgery, indications, surgeons, grading of eye pathology and the surgical procedure, time to prepare for surgery and duration of surgery.
   Results: In total, 293 vitreoretinal surgeries were performed during the observation period. Surgeries carried out by the local Kenyan colleagues independently, without intervention of the author, increased from 29.4% (2000) to 78.6% (2006). Due to a constant development in the learning process during the project week more severe cases were treated and preparation time for surgery from the nursing side has shortened.
   Conclusions: By initiating a project week with high frequency surgery, supported by a highly experienced visiting surgeon, vitreoretinal surgery can be successfully set up in an ophthalmic clinic of a developing country. This approach has some advantages when compared to long-period projects, especially for the purposes of sustainability. However, to be successful it requires systematic planning which is described in this article.

In the area of global health, veterinarians can aid USAID's work to improve the quality, availability, and use of essential health services that specifically target maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, family planning and reproductive health, infectious diseases, environmental health, nutrition, and other life-saving areas. The challenge of making the agricultural sector in a developing country more productive is a critical one for USAID and a clear area for input from the veterinary profession. Animal agriculture is the largest single sector of agricultural economies in most developing countries, and livestock remains a critical component of poverty alleviation. There are educational requirements that benefit anyone working at USAID and can be met prior to admittance to a DVM program, as part of a DVM curriculum, or in post-graduate training/employment, such as proficiency in a foreign language; environmental sciences background; familiarity with accounting and management techniques; expertise in foreign animal diseases, zoonotic diseases, epidemiology, food safety, and nutrition, as well as the application to human health of those areas; an advanced degree such as an MPH; and management experience. Appropriately trained veterinarians can make enormous contributions to USAID's global efforts to improve the health and agriculture sectors of developing nations.

TI Urban informalities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): A solution for or
   barrier against sustainable city development
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The roles of urban informalities in the advancement of the sustainable city agenda are contested in conventional literature. However, the contestation does not take account of the entire dimensions of sustainable cities. To present a holistic argument, the present study examines the roles of informalities in advancing the sustainable city agenda in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by using the sustainable development prism as the analytical framework. A Boolean search methodology was adopted to obtain relevant literature written in the English language from repositories such as Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. The results of a synthesis of the literature suggest that informalities play double-pronged roles in the pursuit of the sustainable city development agenda in SSA. Overall, the emergence of informality is as a result of the failure of the formal systems. They provide employment, secure household income and savings, support national income, provide household basic needs (water access and waste management), and enhance civic engagement. However, informalities contribute to social and gender inequality, insecurity, congestion, and pollution. Based on their positive roles in the advancement of sustainable cities, we recommend a rejection of the prohibitive policies and attitudes towards informalities and call for regularisation as an approach to address the associated ills.

TI Decoupling transport from economic growth: Extending the debate to
   include environmental and social externalities
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB The concept of decoupling embraces both immaterialisation and dematerialisation, by referring to the general delinking of environmental harm from economic production. This paper extends the theoretical debate and methodology on decoupling in transport to cover environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) issues as well as the economic dimensions (e.g. income growth and transport activities). The typology developed here details the concepts of absolute and relative decoupling in a strong and weak version. This typology is then applied to explore the potential and the reality of transport decoupling in 15 major countries over the period since 1990, when concerns over the global environment and social issues have become a central part of the sustainable development agenda, through the measurement of changes in all three of the elements of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social). Two key transport externalities, carbon dioxide emissions and traffic fatalities, are studied, as these represent examples of environmental and social costs associated with increased levels of mobility. These 15 key countries included both developed and developing countries, and they together account for the majority of the global economy, carbon emissions and a substantial proportion of transport fatalities. The results show that decarbonisation of the transport sector has proved more difficult to achieve in the 15 countries over the 22 years than the reduction in the levels of transport-related fatalities. Nevertheless, there is progress beiug made. Decoupling has taken place in both developed and developing countries, though the experiences vary in terms of timing (earlier vs more recent), consistency (stable vs variable), form (absolute vs relative) and magnitude (strong vs weak). Recoupling effects are limited. Transport has proved to be the most difficult sector to make more sustainable, as it is growing so fast and as it is necessary to support economies and lifestyles. Yet through combining measures of economic (e.g. income), environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) wellbeing, it has been possible to identify positive trends in decoupling transport at the national level, as measured through relative decoupling. The much harder objective of an absolute decoupling is only just beginning to take place, but this must be seen as the primary objective in moving towards sustainability in the transport sector.

TI Social and environmental sustainability in the clothing industry: a case
   study of a fair trade retailer
SO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the issues currently involved in social and environmental sustainability in the clothing industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a case study approach to investigate a business that operates successfully in this challenging market.
   Findings - As a consequence of increasing demand for ethical clothing, it has become standard practice for UK clothing retailers to develop CSR policies which impact upon their methods of garment sourcing and partnerships with suppliers. There is also a significant trend for retailers to offer ethical clothing ranges made fromorganic cotton or produced by Fair Trade manufacturers. The paper includes a case study on People Tree, which sells Fair Trade clothing sourced from developing countries. People Tree is rare amongst clothing companies in that it provides customers with a transparent view of its production sources via the internet. The company provides an example of how socially responsible and environmentally sustainable global sourcing can be applied in practice.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on aspects of sustainability in an individual retailer. This could be extended to other ethical retailers in different countries, and a longitudinal study of such companies could be conducted.
   Originality/value - Literature on ethical fashion companies and their use of socially responsible strategies is sparse, and there is a lack of research that covers both social and environmental sustainability in this market. This paper fills some of the gaps.

TI A hybrid game theory and system dynamics model to determine optimal
   electricity generation mix
SO COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB One criteria for the success in achieving sustainable development is to supply electricity by considering the diversity of generation technology. Also, the consumption of fossil fuels is considered as a major challenge for sustainable development. Relying heavily on fossil resources for electricity generation and the growing trend in emissions is one of the serious problems of developing countries. In this research, the sustainable growth of Iran's electricity industry in the short and long term time horizons is investigated using three game theory models in a system dynamic model. The competition, cooperation and profits of electricity suppliers as well as the government's role are modeled. Carbon dioxide emissions, water and natural gas consumption are also calculated. The results show the amount of carbon dioxide emissions, water and gas consumption in the Stackelberg and cooperation model decrease by 19.3%, 18.4% and 16.5%, respectively, compared to the continuation of the current trend.

TI UNIVERSITY COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT IN MAKENI (SIERRA LEONE)
SO KULTUR-REVISTA INTERDISCIPLINARIA SOBRE LA CULTURA DE LA CIUTAT
AB Medium-sized african cities, with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants are the main urban challenge of the moment. In the coming decades, urban development will involve a significant increase in urban land in developing countries.
   The lack of resources, an appropriate regulatory framework, professionals in urban planning and habitability in urban environments of these cities, are realities that show the urgency for to articulate a major collective effort.
   Conventional urban and regional planning is not able to respond to these challenges in time and scale. On the one hand because of the speed of the progressive increase of illegal settlements and the constant population growth. On the other hand on account of the difficulty for people to take proposals forward planning in contexts where there is no culture in planning.
   Between Madrid (Spain) and Makeni (Sierra Leone) starts an experience in which the University and Development Cooperation emerge as critical elements of institutional and educational strengthening and training. Collaboration between universities (uspceu-unimak) is the beginning of a process of urban reflection involving the City Council and local stakeholders.

TI Integrated analysis for supporting solid waste management development
   projects in low to middle income countries: The NAVA-CE approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Developments in solid waste management (SWM) are challenging in low to middle-income countries. The cooperation among local and international actors can support the introduction of small-scale solutions in order to sustain the implementation of waste recycling systems. The objective of this paper is to present the steps forward in the submission of development projects focused on the execution of circular economy principles. The study was conducted in La Paz, Bolivia, where SWM indicators, interviews with local stakeholders and citizens, the analysis of the environmental impacts through life cycle assessment, and the implementation of small-scale selective collection systems were implemented for assessing local opportunities in recycling. The technical methods, the cooperation network, and the analysis conducted during four years of research are summarized and presented, introducing a case study novel in the scientific literature. Results reported that the cooperation among local and international stakeholders, together with the implementation of technical studies, allows drafting and submitting development projects for obtaining international funding that can be used for starting SWM pilot actions. The approach employed, here called NAVA-CE - Net Added Value Assessment of a Circular Economy - can be of interest to international actors involved in SWM and development cooperation for supporting a sustainable future.

TI Moving the G20's investment agenda forward
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB This article argues that it is of paramount importance that the G20 pays attention to the mounting challenges faced by the international investment regime. This is all the more important because international investment is crucial to advance sustainable development, especially in developing countries. For both immediate and long-term reasons, investment policies should therefore be a core item on the agenda of the G20 and the Trade and Investment Working Group in particular. The present article makes two sets of recommendations: first, the G20 should continue its work on international investment policy reform and initiate steps to operationalise the Guiding Principles for Global Investment Policymaking; second, the G20 should support ongoing WTO discussions on investment facilitation suggesting that they should aim not only at facilitating more foreign direct investment (FDI), but sustainable FDI. The policy recommendations provide an input for the Japanese G20 presidency in 2019.

AB OBJECTIVE: Rwanda's Ministry of Health, coordinating with Partner's in Health and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, implemented the Human Resources for Health Scale-Up Plan. The purpose of this program is to train and retain high quality health care professionals in order to improve and sustain health in Rwanda.
   DESIGN: In May 2011, an oral health team of faculty from Rwanda and USA proposed to Rwanda's Ministry of Health that oral health be included in the HRH program. The proposal outlined a diagonal approach to curriculum design that supports the principles of global health through interconnected training for both treatment and collaborative prevention, rather than discipline-based fragmented training focused on isolated risk factors. It combined "vertical" direct patient care training, "horizontal" interdisciplinary training to address common underlying risk factors and associations for disease through primary care, and program retention and sustainability.
   RESULTS: The proposal was accepted by the Ministry of Health and was approved for funding by the US Government and The Global Fund. Rwanda's first Bachelor of Dental Surgery program is currently under development.
   CONCLUSIONS: Globalization has affected the health of the world's developing countries in complex ways. Addressing the impacts of globalization on these regions requires an interdisciplinary "diagonal" approach to improving and sustaining health in an interconnected world.

TI Hydroelectricity production and forest conservation in watersheds
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Globally, particularly in developing countries, hydroelectricity production and economic growth occur together with ecosystem/biodiversity conservation in watersheds. There is a relationship between hydroelectricity production and ecosystem/biodiversity conservation in watersheds, centering on the supply and demand for ecosystem services of river water flow regulation and sediment retention. Here we show that, in the upper reach of the Yangtze River, hydroelectricity production of Three Gorges Hydroelectric Power Plant can form a beneficial relationship with forest conservation through the paid use (compensating residents for their cooperation in the conservation) of ecosystem services launched by the National Natural Forest Protection Project. This interaction can provide additional incentives to encourage local communities' long-term cooperation in conserving and protecting the restored forest ecosystems. Hydroelectricity plants also obtain benefits from this interaction. The industrialization of ecosystem services supply provides an operational framework for this beneficial interaction. Sustainable forest ecosystem conservation will require developing new institutions and policies and must involve local communities in the conservation and protection of their local forests.

TI External Financing for Inclusive Growth in Lower - Middle Income West
   African Countries: Foreign Direct Investment versus Official Development
   Assistance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB Most developing countries are plagued with harsh economic realities, which motivate them to seek sustainable economic growth and development in line with goal eight of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. To this end, this paper investigated the source of external financing that is most helpful for achieving inclusive growth in lower-middle-income West African countries. The study is a panel analysis of annual data extending from 2000 to 2019. The study employed the Emirmahmutoglu and Kose Bootstrap Granger Causality Test, Westerlund Cointegration Test, Common Correlated Mean Group estimation technique, and Augmented Mean Group estimation technique for econometric analyses. The long-run empirical results from the study showed that both foreign direct investment and foreign aid have positive and significant effects on inclusive growth, although the impact of foreign direct investment is greater than that of foreign aid. A bi-directional causality was also found to exist between inclusive growth and foreign direct investment, while no causal relationship was detected between inclusive growth and foreign aid. Given the study's empirical outcomes, it is recommended that West African countries prioritize macroeconomic policy reforms that provide enabling conditions for foreign direct investment to thrive rather than pursue foreign aid that more often than not are misdirected.

TI Multinational and large national corporations and climate adaptation:
   are we asking the right questions? A review of current knowledge and a
   new research perspective
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Adapting to climate change requires the engagement of all actors in society. Until recently, the predominant research focus has been on governments, communities, and the third sector as key actors in the adaptation process. Yet, there is a growing emphasis internationally on understanding the role of and the need to engage businesses in adaptation given their potential to finance projects, develop technologies and innovative solutions, and enhance the scale and cost-effectiveness of certain adaptation measures. Large national and multinational corporations are among the key actors in this respect. Already, many of these corporations are purportedly taking steps to adapt their operations to climate change. Some stated reasons for their engagement include minimizing potential impacts on value chains, improving resource efficiency, enhancing production of sustainable raw materials, and supporting customers', suppliers', and communities' climate change adaptation efforts. However, there is a paucity of work analysing adaptation actions by these corporations, their motivations and contribution to broader adaptation and climate-resilient development efforts, as well as possible instances of maladaptation. We apply a three-tier framework on drivers, responses, and outcomes to examine the state of knowledge according to recent literature on private sector and corporate adaptation to climate change. Our review highlights that the literature on the impact and outcomes of corporate adaptation actions is sparse and we consider the implications for future research. Our analysis concludes with a reflection on the relevance of corporate-led adaptationfor the companies themselves, policymakers at all scales, as well as society at large.

TI Alternative approaches for better municipal solid waste management in
   Mumbai, India
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Waste is an unavoidable by product of human activities. Economic development, urbanization and improving living standards in cities, have led to an increase in the quantity and complexity of generated waste. Rapid growth of population and industrialization degrades the urban environment and places serious stress on natural resources, which undermines equitable and sustainable development. Inefficient management and disposal of solid waste is an obvious cause of degradation of the environment in most cities of the developing world. Municipal corporations of the developing countries are not able to handle increasing quantities of waste, which results in uncollected waste on roads and in other public places. There is a need to work towards a sustainable waste management system, which requires environmental, institutional, financial, economic and social sustainability.
   This study explores alternative approaches to municipal solid waste (MSW) management and estimates the cost of waste management in Mumbai, India. Two alternatives considered in the paper are community participation and public private partnership in waste management. Data for the present study are from various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and from the private sector involved in waste management in Mumbai. Mathematical models are used to estimate the cost per ton of waste management for both of the alternatives, which are compared with the cost of waste management by Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). It is found that the cost per ton of waste management is Rs. 1518 (US$35) with community participation; Rs. 1797 (US$41) with public private partnership (PPP); and Rs. 1908 (US$44) when only MCGM handles the waste. Hence, community participation in waste management is the least cost option and there is a strong case for comprehensively involving community participation in waste management.

TI Renewable energy utilization to promote sustainability in GCC countries:
   policies, drivers, and barriers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB There is a growing focus on the role of renewable energy (RE) policies such as feed-in tariffs (FITs), renewable portfolio standards (RPSs), subsidies, incentives, and research and development in the global energy policy mix and in promoting environmental sustainability. Although most developed countries have well-formulated RE policies, in developing countries, such policies face many barriers. This study analyzes the policies, drivers, and barriers to RE deployment for fostering environmental sustainability in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. In the GCC region, the need for economic diversification to reduce dependency on single resource, diminishing hydrocarbon reserve, loss of oil export revenue, climate change mitigation pledges, and abundant solar energy resource are the key drivers for diversifying energy sources to include RE. However, the apparent lack of consolidated policy framework for wide-scale RE utilization calls for a well-articulated policy to advance RE development in each member state. Although FIT and RPS approaches could be effective for initial deployment of small-scale RE projects, a competitive tendering and auctioning mechanisms are more suitable for large-scale projects. Whereas, developing effective energy codes could successfully promote RE deployment, the increased share of RE in energy supply would have synergistic impacts on the region. The GHG emissions avoidance expected to be achieved by the GCC countries will vary between 5 and 247 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. The fulfillment of inspirational RE targets for 2030 would contribute in fulfilling climate change mitigation pledges, environmental sustainability, economic growth, and generating new jobs.

TI Introduction: Real Time Monitoring for the Most Vulnerable - Investing
   in Common Guidance for Equity and Quality
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Growth in the use of real-time digital information for monitoring has been rapid in developing countries across all the social sectors, and in the health sector has been remarkable. Commonly these Real Time Monitoring (RTM) initiatives involve partnerships between the state, civil society, donors and the private sector. There are differences between partners in understanding objectives, and further divergence often occurs due to adoption of specific technology-driven approaches and because profit-making is a part of the equation for some partners. With the swarming, especially of pilot mHealth initiatives, in many countries there is risk of chaotic disconnects, of confrontation between rights and profits, and of overall failure to encourage appropriate alliances to build sustainable and effective national RTM systems. What is needed is a country-led process for strengthening the quality and equity sensitivity of real-time monitoring initiatives. This article proposes the development of an effective learning and action agenda centred on the adoption of common guidance.

TI Success factors and the city-to-city partnership management process -
   from strategy to alliance capability
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
CT Expert Seminar on Transnational City-to-City Cooperation - Issues
   Arising fromTheory and Practice
CY APR, 2008
CL Utrecht, NETHERLANDS
AB International city-to-city (C2C) partnerships, also known as twinning or sister cities, have evolved from their beginnings as a facilitating instrument of international friendship and cultural exchange at the local level, to a powerful tool for capacity building, learning, and economic and social development in developing countries. In recent years research findings from both academic and practitioner studies have provided much-needed insights into the failure rate and factors that contribute to the sustainability and success of such relationships. But to apply these principles, cities need guidelines and a formal policy and process framework to conclude sustainable relationships and manage them successfully. This paper draws on recent studies in South Africa and the United States of America, and frames a C2C partnership as a strategic alliance entered into between two or more cities. It applies principles from the management literature on strategic alliances to the field of C2C cooperation and proposes a management and planning model which municipalities involved in international C2C partnerships can use to ensure the success of individual relationships. This model consists of six steps: strategy formulation, identification of potential partners, evaluation and selection of potential partners, negotiation of the alliance and agreement, implementation, and the embedding of knowledge which leads to alliance capability and continued alliance success. The paper suggests that C2C cooperation can make a major development contribution and that application of this model can effectively increase relationship success at the local level.

TI China's belt & road initiative energy cooperation: International
   assessment of the power projects
SO ENERGY
AB Despite growing concerns over China's Belt & Road Initiative (BRI)'s electricity generation projects, studies analyzing the suitability of such projects to importing countries are rare. Filling this gap, this article assesses the opportunities and challenges of the BRI coal, hydro, wind, and solar power projects. To exploit the full benefits of both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which enables quantitative analysis of the qualitative methods of the interviews and of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis elaborated via consultation of experts. While the BRI power cooperation is a real chance to offer cleaner and more efficient electricity generation especially in developing countries, more emphasis on sustainable development can better guide the BRI power projects.

TI Education in ear and hearing care in remote or resource-constrained
   environments
SO JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY
AB Background At the heart of surgical care needs to be the education and training of staff, particularly in the low-income and/or resource-poor setting. This is the primary means by which self-sufficiency and sustainability will ultimately be achieved. As such, training and education should be integrated into any surgical programme that is undertaken. Numerous resources are available to help provide such a goal, and an open approach to novel, inexpensive training methods is likely to be helpful in this type of setting. The need for appropriately trained audiologists in low-income countries is well recognised and clearly goes beyond providing support for ear surgery. However, where ear surgery is being undertaken, it is vital to have audiology services established in order to correctly assess patients requiring surgery, and to be able to assess and manage outcomes of surgery. The training requirements of the two specialties are therefore intimately linked. Objective This article highlights various methods, resources and considerations, for both otolaryngology and audiology training, which should prove a useful resource to those undertaking and organising such education, and to those staff members receiving it.

TI COVID-19 and International Trade: The Role of the WTO in Fighting the
   Pandemic and Building Back Better
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has presented one of the most significant global challenges in recent times. Movement restrictions to contain the spread of the virus led to supply-chain disruptions and shortage of essential products and services in many parts of the world. Many countries responded with trade restrictive measures to safeguard supply of essential goods for their population. However, this was also accompanied with a growing realization that global challenges require global solutions. The WTO provided a forum for international cooperation, allowing Members to coordinate their trade policies, and discuss further steps needed to fight against the pandemic. Now, with several vaccine candidates having been approved for use, the most pressing challenge is to ensure equitable and speedy access to vaccines. The WTO has an important role in this, from ensuring that trade actions are not used to pose a barrier to affordable and good-quality vaccines, to increasing vaccine production capacities in developing countries, and strengthening vaccine supply chains for quick delivery even in remote locations.

TI The role of South-North partnerships in promoting shared learning and
   knowledge transfer
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB While it is clear that hospitals in developing countries need to improve quality of health services and improve patient safety, hospitals in high resource countries need to do the same. Most often the focus on improvement through institutional health partnerships involves hospital teams from high resource settings attempting to aid and teach hospital staff in low resource settings, particularly in Africa. However these efforts to provide assistance may be more satisfying and sustainable if we understand that partnership learning is bi-directionalwhere by hospital teams from high resource settings also benefit. One particular partnership-based model that demonstrates this benefit to high resource partners is the World Health Organization African Partnerships for Patient Safety (APPS). Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety & Quality (AI) through the APPS model has co-created twinning partnerships with hospitals in Uganda, South Sudan & Liberia. This commentary aims to deconstruct specific learnings that have benefited the Johns Hopkins AI community through the APPS partnership.

   future role within a broader framework for transnational co-operation
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL
AB Over the past decade a number of changes can be observed within the development policy system. This paper presents and discusses these changes along three dimensions: narratives, strategies and operational approaches. Changes are manifold, ranging from the application of new narratives, such as the migration narrative, to alternations in strategic objectives (e.g. developing countries' graduation issues), new instruments (in the form of development finance at the interface with the private sector), and the application of new concepts for project implementation (e.g. through frontier technologies). We discuss the implications and effects of these changes for the current and potential future role of the development policy system, as well as preliminary ideas for a concept of global co-operation for sustainable development (GCSD), spanning beyond the development policy system.

TI Tackling climate change through circular economy in cities
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Circular economy principles can lead to a series of opportunities to tackle climate change, particularly in cities of developing countries where the generation of waste, consumption and demand for energy is growing rapidly. This paper aims to advance the understanding of the expansion of circularity for tackling climate change using biomass for energy at the urban scale. In addition, little is known about how Circular Economy (CE) flows can be quantitatively integrated, what potential trade-offs exist in promoting Circular Economy using biomass, and how governance models can integrate these flows and contribute to a Circular Economy transition in cities. Based on an empirical study of a city in India, where the private sector participation through an innovative Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model enabled the use of urban wastewater in thermal power plants, the study presents the viability of Circular Economy models at the city scale. The feasibility of a further expansion of this circularity by co-firing biomass in local thermal power plants was analyzed, as a potential solution for reducing pollution and carbon emissions in a hard-to-abate sector. The result indicated an average 20.5 MJ kg-1 calorific value for torrefied mixed biomass pellets from crop residues, which, if applied to about 447 kt y-1 surplus biomass available in Nagpur would amount to 9.18 PJ of energy (per year). Overall, local power plants demanded about 19.85 Mt of coal in 2017-18, equivalent to 297.8 PJ in that fiscal year. Thus, the supply of torrefied pellets from peri-urban crop residues can meet between 2 and 3% of the demand from coal-fired power plants, resulting in a 0.3% decrease in the emissions from the power sector in India in 2017-18 (i.e., 922 MtCO2), benefiting different sectors and levels of government. The analysis provides a framework for understanding the technical and institutional possibilities for strengthening the relationship between circular economy and climate change in the cities of developing countries by connecting flows and systems within and beyond urban centers. Therefore, the expansion of Circular Economy in cities can occur by integrating urban sectors and policy coordination at different levels of governance. Partnerships between local governments, utilities, and civil society for co -managing energy, water, and waste in cities can reduce the financial burden on national governments, including meeting national emission targets.

TI Enablers and Barriers of a Cross-Cultural Geriatric Education Distance
   Training Programme: The Singapore-Uganda Experience
SO GERIATRICS
AB Background: By 2050, 80% of the world's older population will reside in developing countries. There is a need for culturally appropriate training programs to increase awareness of eldercare issues, promote knowledge of how to better allocate resources to geriatric services, and promulgate elder-friendly policies. A monthly distance geriatric education programme between a public hospital in Singapore and health institute in Uganda was implemented. This study explored the enablers and barriers to the delivery of culturally appropriate geriatric education programmes via a videoconferencing platform. Methods: We conducted 12 in-depth interviews with six teachers from Singapore and six learners from Uganda. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using an inductive thematic approach to analysis with the aid of the NVivo software. Results: Enablers included inter-personal real-time interactions between teachers and learners whereas misaligned perceptions of cross-cultural differences between Singaporean teachers and Ugandan learners were a barrier. Rapport building, teacher motivation and institutional support were perceived to contribute to the programme's sustainability. Overall, Ugandan learners perceived that the training improved knowledge, skills, attitude and practice of geriatric care. Participants suggested that future initiatives consider aligning cross-cultural perceptions between partners, conducting a training needs analysis, exploring complementary modes of information dissemination, and allotting time for more interaction, thereby reinforcing mutual sharing. Adequate publicity and appropriate incentivisation may also better sustain the programme. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cross-cultural training via a videoconferencing platform was feasible. Our results inform planners of future distance educational programmes of how to improve standards of cross-cultural competency and forge promising international partnerships.

TI Access to electricity in Small Island Developing States of the Pacific:
   Issues and challenges
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Energy poverty is widespread in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific. It is estimated that 70 percent of Pacific Islander households do not have access to electricity, which is equivalent to access rates in sub-Saharan Africa and slightly below the average for low income countries. Pacific SIDS face unique challenges in expanding access to electricity, given that their populations are spread across tens of thousands of islands. Governments and development partners in Pacific SIDS continue to prioritise development of electricity grids, as is evident in ongoing subsidisation of grid-based power consumption and the establishment of ambitious (grid-based) renewable energy targets.
   This paper argues that traditional approaches to rural electrification which prioritise grid extension are not suited to the Pacific islands region. Increased funding should be directed by both governments and development partners towards rural electrification, especially in off-grid areas where isolated systems are more appropriate. Institutional reform is also important. Regulatory reform is needed for power utilities to extend electricity grids into rural areas. Institutional arrangements that facilitate the sustainable operation and maintenance of off-grid systems also need to be established. Past donor and government-funded off-grid rural electrification projects have rarely been sustainable. Alternative approaches involving payment of output-based subsidies to energy service companies are worth exploring, although will only succeed where sound regulatory arrangements are in place.

AB The availability of affordable and reliable energy is one of the most crucial requirements for economic development and modernization of developing countries. This is particularly important in Africa. With a population of 13.4% of the world and a land area of 15%, Africa has only 2% of the world's industrial capacity. Its per capita income is only 15% of the world average and only consumes 3% of world energy. Today, less than 15% of Africa's population has access to electricity and where much of the available supply is unreliable. In addition to regional cooperation and integration through energy pooling and cross-border energy trading, a balanced Distributed Generation strategy through modified microgrids has been proposed in the previous discussion [1]. This paper serves as continuation of a distributed micro grid application specific to small towns and villages fishing processing potential. This development will serve as primary building blocks for future system expansion. Issues regarding the potential resources for hybrid distributed generation and reliability of power supply are addressed.

   in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA
AB The Japanese government published "The Water and Sanitation Broad Partnership initiative (WASABI)" in March 2006. This initiative was based on the policies that Japan will support the self-help efforts of developing countries on water and sanitation, establishing broad partnerships with international organizations, and the other donor agencies, etc. Because water resources are very limited, there are many areas and regions which have to use a heavily polluted water source. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the emergent water treatment technology which can supply safe drinking water from polluted source water at a reasonable cost.
   In order to anticipate a sustainable development of water service the Japanese ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare published "The Water Works Vision" so as to restructure the water utility management system in 2004. The vision asks to reform the water utility management system so as to mobilize every resource including public private partnership. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an audit system by a third party for risk communication among the stakeholders.

TI Evaluating the Efficiency of Municipal Solid Waste Collection Services
   in Developing Countries: The Case of Chile
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Due to the increasing volume of waste and the increasingly complex administration of its collection and disposal, solid waste management is quickly becoming a demanding issue for municipalities all over the world. Benchmarking the effectiveness of municipal solid waste management is critical for assessing municipalities' resource management performance and developing public policies for improvement. The main contribution of this article is an analysis of the efficiency of municipal collection services in Chile focusing in house solid waste. This study estimates the economic and technical efficiency using Stochastic Frontier Models for socio-economic, technical and human geography data from 2014 to 2019 for a sample of 280 municipalities, as well as an analysis of the internal and external factors that influence the efficiency levels shown by municipalities using an econometric model with 2017 socio-economic data. In addition, the spatial distribution of efficiency is investigated, with the Moran index used to identify clusters of towns to see if there is any spatial autocorrelation. The findings show that there are considerable disparities depending on whether the collection is private, public or mixed, and that rural municipalities are inefficient. The efficiency is not distributed evenly throughout space. The findings and recommendations of this study are intended to aid in the improvement of municipal and public policies relating to MSW management efficiency.

AB Nowadays, economic growth and industrial cluster have already seen much success in some of the developing countries, such as China. Based on the existing theory of industrial cluster, for instance Porter's famous Diamond Model, firstly we begin with an overview of some typical industrial clusters in China. But, what are the major factors affecting the formation and competitiveness of industrial clusters? While location continues to be important, quality, SCM and cooperation matter more than before. In this paper, a shipbuilding clusters from Shandong Peninsula of China is chosen for case studies. In order to shed new light on the building process of Shandong Peninsula shipbuilding cluster, we take the advantage of some historical data and point out that three major factors have been playing important roles in the building process of the cluster: The breaking down of the technological barrier, which allows the enterprise founders to initiate their business; the breaking down of the capital barrier, which helps the continuing development of the enterprises; the breaking down of the institutional barrier, which ensures the successful formation of the entire cluster community. To conclude, both the inter-enterprise cooperation and the positive attitude upon institutional barrier are valued. Additionally, this cluster experience discussed in this paper also aims to the need for the sustainability of SMEs.

TI Strengthening capacity for clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa:
   partnerships and networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Y Global research collaboration, through partnerships and networks, is an effective way to deliver highly impactful and sustainable research that is collectively owned and promoted for the global good. Many models exist for effective North-South collaborations that are built on trust and balanced benefits. The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) model emphasises capacity development in clinical trials and product-focused implementation research. To ensure effectiveness and sustainability, capacity development requires a long-term perspective, an integrated system-wide approach, and local ownership and leadership from countries experiencing high disease burdens. Guided by these principles, the EDCTP2 programme, established in 2014, has developed and strengthened human capital and institutional capacities in 39 countries in sub-Saharan Africa to undertake high-quality clinical research guided by good clinical and regulatory practices. Projects in these countries have involved 238 African and 163 European institutions. To date, EDCTP has supported 171 Fellows and 232 postgraduate trainees. EDCTP-short-term training activities have equipped 9628 researchers and medical personnel. The EDCTP capacity-building described here includes its Regional Networks of Excellence and its Consortia for public health emergencies which provide the foundation for sustained efforts against emerging and re-emerging global health threats.

   Efficiency: Evidence from Countries along the 21st-Century Maritime Silk
   Road
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative blazes a new path for countries to cooperate for mutual benefits, and transport infrastructure has become the main battlefield for investment. With data from 2000 to 2017, the research adopts Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to evaluate transport infrastructure investment efficiency of 20 countries along the route. The results show that the average investment efficiency is 0.552 which is in the state of inefficiency, exposing the problems of efficiency loss and resource waste, but still, a yearly increasing trend is evident. The investment efficiency of the developed countries is notably higher, revealing remarkable regional discrepancy and imbalance of development. The research also reveals the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and the Initiative's positive effect on investment efficiency by empirical examinations. PPP has helped improve investment efficiency overall but PPP in different transport sectors has heterogeneous effect that road and port PPP can significantly promote investment efficiency. The Initiative has also boosted investment efficiency along the route, especially for developing countries. All this proves the superiority and necessity of PPP and the far-reaching significance of this valuable initiative for the sustainable development of all countries.

Elements from earth's crust were most abundant during the seasonal Harmattan period between late December and late January when Saharan dust is carried to coastal West Africa. During Harmattan, crustal particles accounted for 55 mu g m(-3) (37%) of fine particle. (PM2.5) mass and 128 mu g m(-3) (42%) of PM10 mass. Outside Harmattan, biomass combustion, which was associated with higher black carbon, potassium, and sulfur, accounted for between 10.6 and 21.3 mu g m(-3) of fine particle mass in different neighborhoods, with its contribution largest in the poorest neighborhood. Other sources were sea salt, vehicle emissions, tire and brake wear, road dust, and solid waste burning. Reducing air pollution in African cities requires policies related to energy, transportation and urban planning, and forestry and agriculture, with explicit attention to impacts of each strategy in poor communities. Such cross-sectoral integration requires emphasis on urban environment and urban poverty in the post-2015 Development Agenda.

TI Perception of Microgardens in Dakar, Senegal
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Promoting sustainable urban food systems through edible urban landscape promotion is a matter of policy and planning Development Cooperation (DC) providers and local institutions all around the world are now converging on urban food and greening strategies. The role of urban greening and more precisely of Urban and Periurban Agriculture (UPA) in implementing sustainable food systems in developing countries is widely recognized Microgardens (MGs), which are a specific typology of UPA, are small-scale urban gardens using different techniques, adapted to the local context, such as organic vegetable gardening, etc. The peculiar characteristic of MGs approach is the focus on sustainable recycling materials as productive inputs such as containers or growth mediums. The present study aims to investigate the consumers' perception of the MGs' supply chain, to better analyse MGs in the city and to give suggestions to urban policy makers and DC providers. The analysis was carried on by direct survey on 671 respondents, in the city of Dakar in Senegal. The study is based on a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) followed by a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). Results suggest that UPA's direct experience, meaning in this case the fact of knowing MGs, leads to greater degree of approval, a positive perception of MGs' market and may lead to greater DC intervention impact.

TI The clean development mechanism in Eastern Europe: an in-depth
   exploration
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a partnership tool founded under the Kyoto Protocol, grants potential opportunities to help developing countries achieve sustainable development. The present research examines the CDM projects in Eastern Europe (Moldova, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania). Although there were far fewer projects in this region than, for instance, China or India, it has some specific features that make it worth studying. Major findings are that most CDM projects in Eastern Europe involved a changing combination of two or more sources of financing, and the distribution of projects in the region was uneven. Moreover, although there was a small number of projects overall, they were all cost-effective, long-term and large-scale. The findings of the research call for improvements to be made to the governance of the CDM, by strengthening the international and national regulation of projects and by aggregating the scales of decision-making and actions so that real multi-scalar transnational governance - from the global level down to the local level - is implemented in a coherent manner. It is also recommended to carry out ex-post project evaluations, following which readjustments could be made.

SO HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH
AB The public sectors of developing countries require strengthened capacity in health informatics. In Peru, where formal university graduate degrees in biomedical and health informatics were lacking until recently, the AMAUTA Global Informatics Research and Training Program has provided research and training for health professionals in the region since 1999. The Fogarty International Center supports the program as a collaborative partnership between Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Peru and the University of Washington in the United States of America. The program aims to train core professionals in health informatics and to strengthen the health information resource capabilities and accessibility in Peru. The program has achieved considerable success in the development and institutionalization of informatics research and training programs in Peru. Projects supported by this program are leading to the development of sustainable training opportunities for informatics and eight of ten Peruvian fellows trained at the University of Washington are now developing informatics programs and an information infrastructure in Peru. In 2007, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia started offering the first graduate diploma program in biomedical informatics in Peru.

TI Addressing of Value Management Implementation Barriers within the Indian
   Construction Industry: A PLS-SEM Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study aims to evaluate the value management (VM) implementation barriers in construction projects. Consequently, information from 126 experts in the building industry was gathered via a questionnaire survey. Subsequently, the data were analyzed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and partial least square structural modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of EFA revealed that the VM barriers were grouped into six new constructs: client, knowledge, information, culture, resources, team members, and workshop. The barriers prioritization model was developed using PLS-SEM, and it indicated that team members are critical barriers to VM adoption. Although this study was limited to India's VM context, its findings can be applied to other developing countries yet to implement VM in their construction industries. The study enhances stakeholder awareness and an understanding of the barriers affecting the implementation of VM, including building professionals, in India. It suggests strategies and activities overcome these barriers and facilitate a higher building quality, while maintaining a reasonable price.

TI Water Services Sustainability: Institutional Arrangements and Shared
   Responsibilities
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Poor water services in developing countries after national conflict as a result of institutional setups and devastating infrastructures. This study assesses how institutional arrangements have affected the poor water services in Somalia, through thematic analyses. The huge gap in the literature about Somalia highlights the significant need of such research works and the originality of this paper. For this paper, different stakeholders were interviewed from seven zones of the city of Garowe. The results show that public private partnerships (PPP) play a vital role in providing drinking water. The results show that the institutions involved in the water sector in Puntland are not well organized. Roles and responsibilities were unclear, and different governmental institutions criticized each other for deliberately taking over others' responsibilities, leading to poor and over-priced domestic water quality. Most consumers cannot afford a drinking water supply to their homes, so they are forced to walk long distances and queue for a long time in order to access water. Our analysis shows that it will be difficult for Somalia to achieve Sustainable Development Goal six (SDG 6) (target one) under the current institutional arrangements. Institutional reforms are recommended in the water sector in order to achieve SDG 6 (Target one), and to ensure safe drinking water in Puntland by 2030.

TI Determinants of user satisfaction with solar home systems in rural
   Bangladesh
SO ENERGY
AB The objective of this research is to analyze the characteristics of households installing solar photovoltaic (systems or solar home systems) SHS in Bangladesh where rural electrification, improvement of rural livelihoods, and sustainable development constitute the primary development agenda. This article attempts to quantitatively determine the factors that affect user satisfaction with SHS, so that improving user satisfaction can contribute to expanding the coverage of SHS in the long run. The research evaluates the determinants of user satisfaction and households' perceptions of the benefits of SHS, including the quality of SHS equipment and reduction in energy costs. The econometric analysis reveals that previous poor experience of the frequency of battery repairs and replacement in SHS negatively influences the satisfaction of households with SHS. The research also suggests user satisfaction improves in the households that achieve lower dependence on kerosene. Moreover, the users who receive the benefits of SHS, especially those resulting from an increase in children's study time, show a higher level of satisfaction with SHS. A key message from the findings is that the benefits of a SHS lifestyle as well as the quality of SHS equipment play a significant role in improving user satisfaction with SHS in rural Bangladesh.

TI The Sustainability of Quinoa Production in Southern Bolivia: from
   Misrepresentations to Questionable Solutions. Comments on Jacobsen
   (2011, J. Agron. Crop Sci. 197: 390-399)
SO JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
AB Reviewing the situation of quinoa production in southern Bolivia, Jacobsen (2011, J. Agron. Crop Sci. 197: 390) argues that the booming export market has a negative effect on the environment and on the home consumption of quinoa, thereby leading to an environmental disaster in the region. In view of the scarcity of scientific knowledge on the rapid social and environmental dynamics in the region, we consider that Jacobsens review misrepresents the situation of quinoa production in southern Bolivia. Specifically, we argue that (i) the data presented by Jacobsen (2011, J. Agron. Crop Sci. 197: 390) do not support any drop in quinoa crop yield supposed to reflect soil degradation and (ii) his demonstration regarding home consumption of quinoa is ill-founded from both a nutritional and a cultural point of view. We suggest that the diffusion of the arguments exposed by Jacobsen (2011, J. Agron. Crop Sci. 197: 390), because of their flaws, might have strong negative impacts on those concerned with sustainable food production and fair-trade with developing countries. We conclude that, rather than reinforced agro-technical controls on local farmers, the rising competition in the international quinoa market requires a shift towards an ethical economy and ethical research cooperation with quinoa producers.

TI A typology of structural approaches to HIV prevention: A commentary on
   Roberts and Matthews
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Renewed enthusiasm for biomedical HIV prevention strategies has followed the recent publication of several high-profile HIV antiretroviral therapy-based HIV prevention trials. In a recent article, Roberts and Matthews (2012) accurately note some of the shortcomings of these individually targeted approaches to HIV prevention and advocate for increased emphasis on structural interventions that have more fundamental effects on the population distribution of HIV. However, they make some implicit assumptions about the extent to which structural interventions are user-independent and more sustainable than biomedical or behavioral interventions. In this article. I elaborate a simple typology of structural interventions along these two axes and suggest that they may be neither user-independent nor sustainable and therefore subject to the same sustainability concerns, costs, and potential unintended consequences as biomedical and behavioral interventions.

TI Factors influencing eco-industrial development in Africa: A SWOT
   analysis of a Tanzanian industrial park
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) have been proposed as a transformative model for assisting developing countries in upgrading their industrial systems to meet higher global environmental standards while boosting economic competitiveness. However, for many industrial settings, the requisite contextual requirements have yet to be clarified. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap. It examines the potential of transforming a case study Tanzanian industrial park, an Export Processing Zone (EPZ), into an EIP. The park was assessed against four criteria (roundput, locality, diversity and gradual change) using SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. The paper draws upon key informant interviews, document reviews and physical site inspection. Findings reveal several strong and weak points of the EPZ, painting a scenario of a zone that is not based on the cycling of resources, does not have a diverse cooperation network arranged locally, and does not rely on the flow of renewables. However, the presence of a park management team, existing synergies, planned synergies and overall national and global development priorities make the park potentially strong as a whole. Our findings underscore the need for deliberate policy interventions. They can be applied to comparable contexts to pinpoint critical areas when planning the interventions.

TI "By the pricking of their thumbs": farmers' income dynamics towards
   sustainable development in rural Ethiopia
SO IBEROAMERICAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB International cooperation priorities and Sustainable Development Goals agree on the linkage between agriculture and economics in developing countries' progress towards sustainability. In rural Ethiopia, agriculture is the major source of income and livelihood. In this study, it is aimed to analyse the association between farmers' experience, education, gender, cultivation of crop diversity, access to various financial resources and income levels among different villages. The methodology adopted is action research, performed during various research stays in rural Ethiopia, and using both qualitative and quantitative surveys. The quantitative results were analysed through multivariate statistical analysis. Interesting results emerge; for example, farmers from rural villages that have been using wells previously donated by the non-profit organization (NPO) show various positive impacts. They attend continuous training in agriculture, nutrition, and economics; they have more crop diversification, and they use varied financial resources. All these factors, as well as sociodemographic variables, link farmers' income levels to villages' improvement and empowerment, creating significant challenges for institutional design of alternative policies to maximize farmers' livelihood, sustainability and socioeconomic development in Third World countries. The article adds to the very small body of research, particularly of quantitative analysis, on factors associated with farmers' income in Africa based on primary data.

ODC can promote free and open EO satellite data and application algorithms, and lower the technical barriers for users on exploiting the data. This project aims to develop the ODC protocol in Taiwan and apply it on a case study forest monitoring after the attack of typhoon Morako in Taimali river basin, the eastern of Taiwan. Firstly, the strategic implementation, the platform, and the infrastructure of Taiwan Data Cube (TWDC) are initiated. And, the TWDC is applied on forest monitoring between 2000 and 2016 using Landsat-7 images. Finally, the improvement and perspective of TWDC protocol are discussed. In the future, ( 1) the Formosat series images will be prepared as Analysis Ready Data (ARD), (2) the software environment will be improved on data management and user interactive interface, and (3) the protocol of TWDC will be duplicated to developing countries on international cooperation projects under the collaboration with CEOS and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

AB Academic outreach projects have been largely ignoring the knowledge of local communities in working on challenges which exist in these places. In the recent past, data has been pointing to the fact that a majority of the community outreach projects in developing countries have failed or proven to be unsustainable. Many of these projects are driven by charitable values, driven by the strong urge to help the people in need. This however might be in direct conflict with ground up problem solving approaches. Charitable work doesn't approach the community challenge with a problem-solving mindset, so the effectiveness and sustainability of the work are undermined [1]. A new approach was designed and the possibilities of a collaborative fact finding, collaborative problem definition and co-designing to solve the challenges were tested. This will ensure the solutions are integrated into the communities' social, economic and cultural landscape while at the same time providing an effective solution which has community ownership. The project will leverage an existing network of collaborating partners to maximize impact.

SO JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB Liberia's prolonged post-conflict transition has negatively impacted its health infrastructure, including the functioning of its health care delivery system. Considering the current national health crises, a study was conducted to identify research gaps and the need to propose changes for improving the health care delivery system in the country. The study results clearly demonstrated a lack of HIV/AIDS research infrastructure including organizational structure, linkages, leadership, champions, expertise, resources, and policies and procedures. Alignment of research needs and practice, and research use to support HIV/AIDS service delivery programmes in the country was also limited. An international research capacity-building partnership is proposed as an effective planned change strategy to strengthen HIV/AIDS-related research infrastructure and to inform management and practice within the Liberian HIV/AIDS service delivery system. A proposed capacity-building planning model can also strengthen research infrastructure and the production and use of research to positively impact the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Liberia and other developing countries.

TI A critical review of fishing agreements with tropical developing
   countries
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries sell fishing licenses to distant water fleets. Fishing agreements have the potential to improve the performance of local fishing sectors. They create income that can be reinvested into domestic industries and often go along with partnerships in management and enforcement. However, many fishing agreements run a serious risk of undermining sustainable resource management. The present study critically reviews trends in distant water fishing as well as identifies those tropical host countries most dependent on fishing agreements. It is shown that traditional, more responsible distant water fleets (DWFs) are being displaced by less responsible, low-cost DWFs and that the most vulnerable host countries are small coastal states with large exclusive economic zones that lack the ability to benefit from value adding processes associated with fishing. The results suggest that the once-promising concept of fishing agreements is gradually posing a threat to both economic development and environmental sustainability of ACP countries.

TI Growing inclusive business models in the extractive industries:
   Demonstrating a smart concept to scale up positive social impacts
SO EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB This paper introduces an important concept for improving sustainability in the extractive industries: inclusive business. Drawing upon examples of inclusive business, as well as the challenges posed from corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies in the extractive sector aimed at socio-economic goals, this paper shows how inclusive business is a better policy to improve sustainability in the sector. The paper argues that this relatively new concept can deliver more useful results in extractive landscapes for socioeconomic development such as diversifying local to regional economies, turning impacted communities into business partners, and facilitating the exit of the extractive industries, whilst at the same time, increasing economic and operational efficiency of the company. Further, inclusive business can be integrated in biodiversity offset policies. It is speculated that inclusive models within the extractive sector have the potential to reach a scale and impact well beyond traditional CSR policies for socioeconomic development.

   Opportunity for the Post-2030 Agenda
SO POST 2030-AGENDA AND THE ROLE OF SPACE: THE UN 2030 GOALS AND THEIR
   FURTHER EVOLUTION BEYOND 2030 FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SE Studies in Space Policy
AB Remittance flows constitute a significant source of financing in support of global development efforts as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and beyond. Annually, remittances roughly total three times the amount of official development assistance from developed countries to developing countries and prove a more reliable and predictable source of resources as compared to private capital flows measured by foreign direct investment. However, the high costs associated with sending remittances limit their potential, resulting in tens of billions lost each year to excessive fees. New trends in the space industry, particularly with the growth of the nano- and microsatellite industry and launch service providers dedicated to this market segment, promise new potential for contributing toward development efforts. Coupled with a rising acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate means of transacting and storing wealth, space-based cryptocurrencies may prove a solution to remedying the high transaction costs associated with remittances. The introduction of space-based cryptocurrencies offers significant potential for the global community in its development efforts, but also poses questions for the post-2030 agenda in how risks associated with these new technologies, especially around regulatory compliance, will be addressed.

TI Sustainability evaluation of public-private partnership microgrid
   considering uncertainty and risk preference
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS
AB Making sustainability evaluation of public-private partnership (PPP) microgrid can not only produce a great impact on distributed generation but also be related to the planning and operation of distribution network. In consideration of the identification of key influence factors (KIFs) about the sustainability of PPP microgrid, information loss, and risk attitude of decision-makers (DMs), an integrated decision framework is proposed to evaluate PPP microgrid from the perspective of sustainability. Firstly, a three-stage method based on interval valued triangular fuzzy (IVTF)-Delph is developed to identify and select KIFs, and a sustainable evaluation criteria system is established from the economic aspect, social aspect, environmental aspect, technical aspect, and managerial aspect, respectively. Secondly, DMs' weights are determined based on the IVTF-TOPSIS method, and combined weights of criteria are determined based on IVTF-AHP and IVTF-entropy. Thirdly, an S-shaped utility function under IVTF environment is utilized to get the ranking of PPP microgrids. Moreover, a case study demonstrates that the proposed sustainability evaluation framework is very suitable for PPP microgrid. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows that the utility values are influenced by risk preference and criterion weight fluctuation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Electric vehicle: A natural option for India?
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
AB The paper is based on the findings of a study on the market potential of electric vehicle (EV) technologies in India, The study revealed that EV might be a more natural option right now in developing countries like India, than in developed countries, Given the warm climate, the current dire state of the environment In urban India, and the resource balance In India - the country has enough reserves of coal but not much oil - and the transportation needs and driving habits of its people (most of the personal transport vehicles are driven only twenty to forty kilometers a day), even a low-end EV technology appears to be economically viable and appropriate. This is established in the paper through concrete evidence of data on all of the above factors. However, adequate awareness about appropriateness of EV for the Indian market is not there among the country's policy makers, researchers, and Industrialists. Indians traditionally look to the developed countries for automobile and other technologies, and since EV is not yet considered viable in most of the developed countries because of their vastly different driving habits and automobile culture, Indian decision makers erroneously take it for granted that EV is not viable for them either. It may be noted that more than 70% of personal transport vehicles In India are two wheelers with extremely polluting two-stroke engines. It is time now for policy makers, researchers, and industrialists of the country to change their mind set and explore the EV option seriously. Specific suggestions have been made In the paper on how this can be done and how India may be supported in these efforts by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. These agencies can facilitate active technology cooperation between developed and developing countries, and help India develop and market appropriate electric vehicles, particularly electric two-wheelers. The India Government should also be encouraged to develop appropriate policies that would hasten the development and creation of viable EV markets. India may thus lead the world toward a path of sustainable development.

TI Utilitarian framings of biodiversity shape environmental impact
   assessment in development cooperation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Biodiversity is under threat from anthropogenic pressures, in particular in biodiversity-rich developing countries. Development cooperation actors, who traditionally focus on the improvement of socio-economic conditions in the South, are increasingly acknowledging the linkages between poverty and biodiversity, e.g. by referring to the ecosystem services framework. However, there are many different framings which stress the need for biodiversity integration and which influence how biodiversity and development are and/or should be linked. Moreover, there is a gap between the lip service paid to biodiversity integration and the reality of development cooperation interventions. This study analyses how biodiversity framings are reflected in environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice, and how these framings influence EIA and decision-making. The findings, based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of World Bank EIAs undertaken in West Africa, indicate the incoherent quality but also the dominance of the 'utilitarian' and 'corrective' framings, which respectively stress human use of nature and mitigation of negative unintended development impacts. Identifying and highlighting these discursive trends leads to increased awareness of the importance of biodiversity among all development actors in North and South. However, some framings may lead to an overly narrow human-centred approach which downplays the intrinsic value of biodiversity. This study proposes recommendations for an improved integration of biodiversity in development cooperation, including the need for more systematic baseline studies in EIAs.

TI Reflections on the state of research: indoor environmental quality
SO INDOOR AIR
AB P>More than 30 years after the First International Indoor Climate Symposium, ten researchers from the USA, Slovakia, Sweden, and Denmark gathered to review the current status of indoor environmental research. We initiated our review with discussions during the 1-day meeting and followed that with parallel research and writing efforts culminating with internal review and revision cycles. In this paper, we present our choices for the most important research findings on indoor environmental quality from the past three decades followed by a discussion of the most important research questions in our field today. We then continue with a discussion on whether there are research areas for which we can 'close the book' and say that we already know what is needed. Finally, we discuss whether we can maintain our identity in the future or it is time to team up with new partners.
   Practical Implications
   In the early years of this field, the accumulated knowledge was small and it was possible for any researcher to acquire a complete understanding. To do so has become impossible today as what we know has grown to exceed the learning capacity of any person. These circumstances challenge us to work collectively to synthesize what we do know and to define clearly what remains to be learned. If we fail to do these things well, we risk repeating research without memory, an inefficiency that we cannot afford.

TI Technology innovation systems and technology diffusion: Adoption of
   bio-digestion in an emerging innovation system in Rwanda
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Ensuring modern household energy services is a key focus for national governments of many developing countries and of international development agencies aiming to support sustainable development issues, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. While renewable energy options are considered to have social and environmental benefits, and despite substantial efforts to support the dissemination of new and improved renewable energy technologies, rates of diffusion remain extremely low. For instance, biogas digester penetration in Rwanda accounts for just 1% of national potential as of 2012. This is in part due to the lack of innovation systems, which foster technology diffusion. This paper analyzes the development of a technological innovation system (TIS) for bio-digestion in Rwanda between 2000 and 2011. We apply the so-called 'functions approach' in analyzing the emergence of a Rwandan biogas technological innovation system. We show the accumulation through time of TIS functions, linking these to the weak diffusion of bio-digesters. We argue that international development assistance should aim to support to the build-up of technological innovation systems in their support for energy technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI Application of a life cycle assessment for assessing municipal solid
   waste management systems in Bolivia in an international cooperative
   framework
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems is strongly recommended and the approach has been used in high-income contexts. However, stakeholders in low to middle income countries are not aware of the potential of this approach, mainly due to a lack of financial resources and technical ability. The present work introduces a LCA of MSWM system scenarios into a developing city using an academic licence for the LCA software that is available for use exclusively by researchers. The MSWM system in place in 2018 in La Paz (Bolivia) was assessed according to seven scenarios. The novelty of the research is twofold: the use of LCA academic licensing in a low to middle income region where LCA is unknown as planning tool; and discussing the potential of the approach in conjunction with local and international stakeholders with a view to starting MSWM projects. The results of the analysis allow for the consideration of energy recovery and materials recycling as the main methods by which the environmental impact of MSW can be reduced, as has also been reported by other LCA studies conducted with full licensing of the relevant software. Moreover, the research is the basis for cooperative development projects that will adopt the LCA approach as the main assessment tool. The study discusses the importance of cooperation between universities and local governments for implementing new strategies for MSWM assessment and planning. The research is a contribution towards improving technical knowledge in developing countries for boosting sustainable development.

AB Public sector health systems that provide services to poor and marginalized populations in developing countries face great challenges. Change associated with health sector reform and structural adjustment often leaves these already-strained institutions with fewer resources and insufficient capacity to relieve health burdens.
   The Strategic Approach to Strengthening Reproductive Health Policies and Programs is a methodological innovation developed by the World Health Organization and its partners to help countries identify and prioritize their reproductive health service needs, test appropriate interventions, and scale up successful innovations to a subnational or national level. The participatory, interdisciplinary, and country-owned process can set in motion much-needed change.
   We describe key features of this approach, provide illustrations from country experiences, and use insights from the diffusion of innovation literature to explain the approach's dissemination and sustainability.

TI The International Environmental Goods and Services Market: an
   Opportunity for Poland
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB The aim of this paper is to present some methodological aspects connected with the evaluation of the growing market of goods facilitating protection of the natural environment. This is a positive phenomenon in this age of ever increasing attention paid to the implementation of principles of sustainable development as well as decreased barriers for improving access to developing markets in the case of both economically highly developed countries and in developing countries. The elimination of trade barriers in foreign trade for goods and services also increases the efficiency of the global economic system by enabling countries to specialize in those sectors in which they possess economic advantages, including those sectors in which they possess favorable natural environmental conditions. The analysis of these goods and services is related also to some regulations of the Committee for Trade and Environment of the WTO, with special reference to conclusions of the Fourth and Fifth Ministerial Conferences in Doha and Cancun. As a member of the European Union, Poland should side with an acceleration in negotiations relating to the quick opening of environmental services markets within the framework of the Doha Round.
   In the sphere of what is known as development assistance, companies from the "old" and "new" members of the EU may undertake investments in developing countries and provide consulting in this realm, as well as deliver capital goods for improving the state of the natural environment, mainly aimed at working against excessive greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and against unfavorable climate changes.

AB This article describes the methodology for the assessment of the innovation project "Incorporation of Information and Communication Technology to facilitate the approach of the Spanish society to the developing countries", funded by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID) and conducted by the NGO "Manos Unidas". This project has as its main objective the incorporation of ICT in Manos Unidas training programmes, as well as its information and awareness-raising campaigns about the reality of the developing countries. The campaigns of Manos Unidas aim to raise awareness about Third World problems and possible solutions. Such programmes and campaigns fall within what is known as "Education for Development". The Education for Development is a process to generate critical thinking that makes citizens to be responsible and active in the task of building a more just and caring society to help people in other parts of the world. This educational process (formal, non-formal and informal) aimed, through knowledge, attitudes and values, to promote global citizenship generating a culture of solidarity committed to fighting poverty and exclusion as well as promoting sustainable human development (Ortega, 2007).
   One of the requirements of the AECID in this agreement was the mid-term evaluation of the planned actions. This paper describes the process and the main results of the evaluation of the training provided for in the agreement and, though not a requirement, a list of indicators of quality of educational programs with ICT in Education for Development was also obtained and it is shown here.

TI The emergence of global attention to health systems strengthening
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB After a period of proliferation of disease-specific initiatives, over the past decade and especially since 2005 many organizations involved in global health have come to direct attention and resources to the issue of health systems strengthening. We explore how and why such attention emerged. A qualitative methodology, process-tracing, was used to construct a case history and analyse the factors shaping and inhibiting global political attention for health systems strengthening. We find that the critical factors behind the recent burst of attention include fears among global health actors that health systems problems threaten the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, concern about the adverse effects of global health initiatives on national health systems, and the realization among global health initiatives that weak health systems present bottlenecks to the achievement of their organizational objectives. While a variety of actors now embrace health systems strengthening, they do not constitute a cohesive policy community. Moreover, the concept of health systems strengthening remains vague and there is a weak evidence base for informing policies and programmes for strengthening health systems. There are several reasons to question the sustainability of the agenda. Among these are the global financial crisis, the history of pendulum swings in global health and the instrumental embrace of the issue by some actors.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
AB The impact of globalisation on local agriculture and food systems has brought issues such as food security and rural sustainability to the forefront of policy-making in developing countries. In China, the restructuring of domestic agriculture and liberalisation of trade following accession to the World Trade Organization have led to the growing reliance on imported food and raised concerns for food self-sufficiency and safety. Inspired by the concept of social economy, social workers in China have explored alternative pathways towards sustainable food production and consumption through local initiatives. Based on participatory action research in a Chinese village, this study examines the potential contribution of social work intervention in responding to China's agrarian challenges. It is shown that by linking rural cooperatives with the local food system and allowing farmers to sell directly to urban consumers at fairer prices, social economy initiatives provide a viable pathway for sustainable transformation by empowering rural producers while giving urban consumers access to sustainably produced food.

AB Background: Increasingly, medical students and practicing clinicians are showing interest in traveling to low-income settings to conduct research and engage in clinical rotations. While global health activities have the potential to benefit both the individual and the host, there can be challenges. We describe one way to harmonize the desire of volunteers to have a meaningful impact on the health care delivery system in a developing country with the needs of that country.
   Methods: The Project Health Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE)-Ghana Emergency Medicine Collaborative (GEMC) Partnership has successfully integrated short-term volunteer physicians and nurses to facilitate the training of emergency medicine (EM) residents and specialist nurses in Kumasi, Ghana.
   Results: Since the launching of this partnership in 2011, eight physicians and 10 nurses have rotated at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). The impact of these volunteers goes beyond the clinical service and supervision they provide while on the ground. They act as mentors to the trainees and assist the program leadership with teaching and assessments.
   Conclusions: Although generally smooth, there have been challenges, all of which have been met and are being resolved. This partnership is an example of how collaborations can harness the expertise and energy of short-term volunteers to achieve the goals of capacity building and self-sustainability.

AB While the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are among the most energy-rich in the world, they face unsustainable growth in energy use and environmental degradation. This paper examines the long-run relationship betIen per capita CO2 emissions and energy intensity in the GCC, while controlling for economic activity, the size of the manufacturing sector, and differences in institutional qualities. I use heterogeneous panel techniques that account for cross-country dependence for the period 1971-2010. I find that energy intensity and emissions are cointegrated in all GCC countries and that conservation and energy efficiency policies have greater potential in reducing emissions in Kuwait, Oman, and the UAE. HoIver, energy efficiency and conservation alone may not be viable policy options to significantly cutting emissions in the next decades. A regional goal of mitigating emissions by 10% would require a reduction in energy intensity by 12%, on average. Therefore, investing in Carbon Sequestration (CS) technologies and strong commitment to renewable energy seem essential ingredients to any sustainable energy and environmental strategy. In addition, I find that judiciary independence is an essential institutional quality for the successful implementation of long-term environmental policies.

TI Non-government organisation engagement in the sanitation sector:
   opportunities to maximise benefits
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Non-government organisations (NGOs) have long played a role in delivering sanitation services to communities in Southeast Asia and Pacific countries, particularly in rural areas. In contrast with large scale infrastructure focused initiatives, NGO programs commonly focus on building linkages between technical and social realms. Drawing on the breadth and depth of NGO experiences, there are opportunities for NGOs to play a greater role in the sanitation sector and to work in partnership with other actors including utilities and government agencies to ensure both 'hardware' and 'software' components of sanitation are built in to project design and delivery to maximise community benefits and ensure longer term system sustainability. This paper discusses these issues and considers how the contribution of NGOs to the sanitation sector in developing countries might be enhanced. The paper is based on recent research for the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) intended to guide investment in the water and sanitation sectors of Asia and Pacific partner countries, exploring the potential for increased NGO engagement. The paper presents findings of the research concerning NGO roles and approaches, discusses existing NGO activities in the sanitation sector in Vietnam and Timor Leste and identifies strategies for NGOs and for other sector actors including utilities and government agencies to maximise the benefits of NGO engagement in the sanitation sector.

TI Characteristics and development of policy and institutional structures
   of emergency response in Vietnam
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB Each nation has its own system to manage and respond to emergencies that reflect the characteristics of that nation's government, economy, and culture. This study provides information on the development of legislation and an institutional framework for the Vietnamese emergency management system. Vietnam is a developing country in the most disaster-prone area of Asia. With a high risk of disasters, emergency management plays a core role in the nation's sustainable development and societal security. Legislation development is the beginning of a better emergency management system. Vietnam's existing legal documents and institutional structures relating to the emergency response structure were reviewed. A discussion on the development of the legislation revealed the reformation of the emergency response structure toward a "multi-hazard approach." By considering the concept of the international standard ISO 22320 [5] on requirements for incident response, the Vietnamese emergency response structure is focused on the following three functions of command and control, operational information, coordination and cooperation. In general, the emergency response structure in Vietnam follows a graded response with functional divisions and relies on the motto "four on-the-spot," which emphasizes the role of local governments in emergency management. To make this motto more effective in emergency response, clear coordination mechanisms among local authorities, police, and the military are necessary. Enhancing the capabilities of local coordination committees is highly recommended to actively respond to emergency cases.

TI Innovation system formation in international development cooperation:
   The role of intermediaries in urban sanitation
SO SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB The transformation of urban basic service sectors towards more sustainability is one of the 'grand challenges' for public policy, globally. A particular urgent problem is the provision of sanitation in cities in low-income countries. The globally dominant centralised sewerage approach has proven incapable to reach many of the urban poor. Recently, an increasing number of actors in international development cooperation has started to develop alternative safely managed non-grid approaches. We approach their efforts as an emerging 'global innovation system' and investigate how its development can be supported by systemic intermediaries. We analyse the activities of the 'Sustainable Sanitation Alliance', an international network that coordinates activities in the sanitation sector and thereby supports this innovation system. The findings show how demand ing it is to fulfil an intermediary role in a global innovation system, because of the need to consider system processes at different scales, in each phase of system building.

SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Over the last decades, the interest of the international community for the multiple interconnections among energy, environment, and society has widely increased. Today, the close link between energy and development is officially recognized. The 2030 development agenda identifies energy access as a necessary precondition for human and social promotion, as well as an instrumental right to fight poverty. Nevertheless access to sufficient, affordable, efficient, reliable, safe and clean energy is not yet an opportunity for all. In developing countries, the problem is critical, but evidence has also risen in emerging countries and, more recently, even in developed countries. A new culture of energy is needed at global level. Innovative solutions and strategies to match the economic growth with the multidimensional targets of sustainability, including environmental preservation and social inclusion, need to be developed. In this scenario, the academia and the scientific community may play a key role by reshaping and updating their traditional mission, based on education, research, and community outreach, with a vision of the society where the human being is settled back at the center of the stage.

AB Over the past few years, the international community has undertaken proactive and extensive efforts to build a cohesive and effective United Nations Development System (UNDS) with more solid institutions and robust leadership. In line with the requirements set out in the UN 2030 Agenda, the United Nations, under the leadership of its secretary-general Antonio Guterres, came up with a reform package that would help contain the further fragmentation of the UNDS. Guided by the principles of extensive consultation, joint action, and shared benefits, China has been extending strong support for the United Nations' reform efforts while playing an important role in global development cooperation. As the world's largest developing country, China insists that any development agenda should always focus on development and that poverty eradication should be the top priority of the UN 2030 Agenda. A number of issues must be addressed when planning for future UNDS reform, in particular the targets and viable ways to promote incremental administrative reform, to improve the existing regional coordinator system, to bridge the funding gap and imbalance between core and non-core resources, and to exemplify emerging countries' best practices.

TI Green Buildings: Eco-friendly Technique for Modern Cities
SO SUSTAINABLE SMART CITIES IN INDIA: CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
SE Urban Book Series
AB Buildings are a major energy consuming sector in the economy. About 35-40% of total energy is used by buildings during construction. The major consumption of Energy in buildings is during construction and later in lighting or air conditioning systems. This consumption must be minimized. Buildings affect land use, energy use, communities and the indoor and outdoor environment. In today's scenario, one of the tools in creating Smart city is Green Building or Sustainable building. Green building is the practice of designing, constructing, operating, maintaining, renovating and demolishing buildings in ways that conserve natural resources, reduce pollution and are environmentally responsible. Green building concept is expanding around the world. Use of sustainable principles in buildings can reduce these impacts and also improve working conditions and productivity, increase energy, water, and material efficiency and reduce costs and risks. Sustainable buildings can be showcases to educate people about environmental issues, possible solutions, partnerships, creativity and opportunities for reducing environmental impacts in our everyday lives. Successful green buildings leave lighter footprints on the environment through conservation of resources. In other words, green building design involves finding the delicate balance between homebuilding and a sustainable environment. In the developing countries like India, poverty alleviation can be effectively achieved by conservation of energy and creation of employment opportunities.

SO VACCINE
AB The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network held its 22nd Annual General Meeting in October 2021. Vaccine manufacturing experts, leaders from global public health organizations and dignitaries from governments and multilateral organizations discussed the challenges and opportunities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 350 delegates from 33 countries, representing over 70 organizations partook in the meetings deliberations.
   The development and scaled-up production of several safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 resulted in over 12 billion doses being produced by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, this scientific achievement and outstanding industry effort has been overshadowed by the striking inequity in access to COVID-19 vaccines. High and upper middle-income countries have received 75% of the vaccines, while in Africa, less than 5% of the people are fully vaccinated. The inequitable access to vaccines is an issue of national health security, which has stressed the need to establish local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa. Key partnerships, initiatives and the deliberate strategies required to achieve sustainable manufacturing on the continent were discussed. The ability to acquire technology, access markets and financing mechanisms, and workforce development were reported as key enablers to achieving a healthy ecosystem.
   Innovative vaccine technologies, new regulatory approaches, and the importance of voluntary technology transfers in increasing the global supply capacity of both COVID-19 vaccines and traditional vaccines were highlighted. In reviewing the lessons learned from the pandemic, speakers shared a consensus that innovation and partnerships will be central to any solution proposed to mitigate the current pandemic and prepare for future ones.

CL NETHERLANDS
AB Demands for food quality and safety as well as concerns over the degradation of natural resources are increasing. On one hand, international organizations and agro-business chains promote the use of practices and procedures such as the HACCP (Hazard analysis and critical control points) to ensure food safety. On the other hand, both public and private policies try to collaborate to protect and conserve natural resources. They try to promote sustainable practices such as those outlined in the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. There is little understanding, however, on how actors from the downstream part of supply chains can collaborate with those in the upstream, particularly in developing economies who face technological and socio-economic constraints to implement the required practices and procedures. This study explores the use of marketing approach - use of incentives for primary producers to implement practices that may improve quality and protect natural resources. To achieve this practices of the fresh Nile perch chain from Lake Victoria are examined. The incentives include access to special investments, price information, selection of transacting partner, and enforcement mechanisms. Data were collected through a conjoint design from 275 fishers who rated their preferences to contract to implement better practices. Results show that access to specific resources was most important followed by price information. Select a trading partner and enforcement were the third and last in importance respectively. These results imply that to promote quality and sustainability in the upstream, downstream actors and corporate businesses should give appropriate incentives.

TI Sustainable Rural Electrification Project Management: An Analysis of
   Three Case Studies
SO ENERGIES
AB Universal access to energy is a global challenge for sustainable development that requires granting last-mile access to energy services to rural and isolated communities. However, achieving access is not sufficient: it must be done affordably, reliably and with an adequate quality. Universal access to energy goes beyond the mere selection of a technical solution or infrastructure; it demands being able to design management models for projects aiming to guarantee that households may access energy services in a sustainable way. This study analyzes the main elements (i.e., governance, technological and business models) of management models in universal access to energy projects and their impact on the different dimensions of sustainability (i.e., social, environmental, and economic). The study then presents three case studies of rural electrification projects having different configurations of the management model, with special focus on the differences in the business model, and it analyzes their outcomes from a sustainability perspective. The analysis of the three case studies suggests that the choice of the business model is key to ensuring sustainability, with fee-for-service models giving the best results. The analysis also highlights the importance of collaboration and involvement of the communities in projects engaging multiple agents with different roles.

TI An engineering perspective on sustainable smallholder farming in
   developing countries
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB The low productivity of smallholder farming systems and enterprises is attributed mainly to the limited resources of farming households and to the application of inappropriate skills and practices that can lead to land degradation. Land productivity may be raised by improved soil and water management and by mechanization (considering the whole spectrum of power sources) that makes better use of human labour and other resources. However, mechanization programmes, which facilitate soil and water management, have to consider cultural and social factors as well as the immediate technical and economic issues. The livelihoods approach provides a framework for dealing with such considerations, which can be elicited through the participation of farmers in the research and development activities.
   Examples are given of participatory research (i.e. research in which scientists and farmers participate as partners) to raise smallholder productivity sustainably in India, Zimbabwe and Latin America. Sustainability is a key issue for economic security in the longer term, and depends on many interacting factors both within and outside the tasks of crop production. The most significant of these factors are discussed and it is emphasized that involving farmers provides a reliable means of accounting for them and enabling the farmers to apply new knowledge to raise productivity, but within the contexts of their own livelihood strategies.

TI Towards the implementation of sustainable biofuel production systems
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Novel energy production systems are needed that not only offer reductions in greenhouse gas emissions but also cause fewer overall environmental impacts. How to identify and implement more sustainable biofuel production alternatives, and how to overcome economic challenges for their implementation, is a matter of debate. In this study, the environmental impacts of alternative approaches to biofuel production (i.e., first, second, and third generation biofuels), with a focus on biodiversity and ecosystem services, were contrasted to develop a set of criteria for guiding the identification of sustainable biofuel production alternatives (i.e., those that maximize socioeconomic and environmental benefits), as well as strategies for decreasing the economic barriers that prevent the implementation of more sustainable biofuel production systems. The identification and implementation of sustainable biofuel production alternatives should be based on rigorous assessments that integrate socioeconomic and environmental objectives at local, regional, and global scales. Further development of environmental indicators, standardized environmental assessments, multi-objective case studies, and globally integrated assessments, along with improved estimations of biofuel production at fine spatial scales, can enhance the identification of more sustainable biofuel production systems. In the short term, several governmental mandates and incentives, along with the development of financial and market-based mechanisms and applied research partnerships, can accelerate the implementation of more sustainable biofuel production alternatives. The set of criteria and strategies developed here can guide decision making towards the identification and adoption of sustainable biofuel production systems.

TI Market-led options to scale up legume seeds in developing countries:
   Experiences from the Tropical Legumes Project
SO PLANT BREEDING
AB There are several hurdles to ensure sustainable seed production and consistent flow of improved legume varieties in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA). The unreliable demand, autogamous nature of most of the grain legumes, and slow variety replacement rate by smallholder farmers do not provide strong incentive for private seed companies to invest in legume seed business. Unless a well thought-out and comprehensive approach to legume seed delivery is developed, current seed shortages will continue, eroding emerging market opportunities. The experiences reported here are collated through a 10-year partnership project, the Tropical Legumes in SSA and SA. It fostered innovative public-private partnerships in joint testing of innovative market-led seed systems, skills and knowledge enhancement, de-risking private sector initiatives that introduced in new approaches and previously overlooked entities in technology delivery. As new public and private seed companies, individual seed entrepreneurs and farmer organizations emerged, the existing ones enhanced their capacities. This resulted in significant rise in production, availability and accessibility of various seed grades of newly improved and farmer demanded legume varieties in the target countries.

TI Globalization and Sustainable Development: Case Study on International
   Transport and Sustainable Development
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB This article assesses the potential contribution for international shipping and long-haul aviation to contribute to sustainable development (SD). The trade literature shows that newly industrializing countries are benefitting from international trade for export-led growth. However, the least developed countries with limited access to international trade networks do not participate in the new global production networks. The World Trade Organization/General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regimes do not have the development of more sustainable transport systems as a priority. In this sense, international transport remains on the fringes of the environment and development policy fields. Three transition pathways to SD have been developed: (a) information and telecommunications technologies leading to particip.ation of least developed countries in global production networks, (b) changes in social preferences toward a high priority for the environment, leading to an extensive growth in fair-trade networks and sustainable production and consumption, and (c) SD from economic growth in newly industrializing countries, with an increased priority placed on solving environmental problems.

TI Analysis of enablers for implementation of sustainable supply chain
   management - A textile case
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Industries currently face pressure on environmental initiatives from both government regulations and global competition in addition to customer pressure. Hence, organizations are forced to implement sustainable practices to improve their environmental performance over economic performance. The Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) system is a concept which ensures environmentally friendly practices in traditional supply chains. Industries in developing countries such as India face pressure from various perspectives to adopt SSCM in Traditional SCM. In this regard, the objective of this study has been fixed to analyze the enablers for implementing SSCM into Indian industries. This study is essential for Indian industries, and especially for textile industries, to market products in the World Trade Organization and huge market opportunities. There are many enablers for adopting SSCM into TSCM, but these enablers do not ensure similar impact in all industries and countries; in fact, where SSCM is adopted the system varies according to culture and the country's regulations. Hence, industries essentially need to identify influential enablers to adopt SSCM. This study aims to identify influential enablers for SSCM by using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) from 13 recommended enablers in five Indian textile units located in south India. ISM results reveal that five enablers dominate an industry's practices, and those five enablers include Adoption of safety standards, Adoption of green practices, Community economic welfare, Health and safety issues, and Employment stability. The result of this study shows that safety perspective enablers provide additional motivation when compared to the other enablers for SSCM adoption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Spatio-temporal variations, spatial spillover, and driving factors of
   carbon emission efficiency in RCEP members under the background of
   carbon neutrality
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Improving carbon emission efficiency (CEE) has emerged as a critical way for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members to promote carbon reduction in the context of climate change mitigation and carbon neutrality. The super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model, which considers non-desired outputs, is adopted to comprehensively assess the current state and trend of CEE in 15 RCEP countries from a spatio-temporal dynamic perspective, and the global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) index is coupled to quantify the spatial and temporal differences and dynamic changes. Following that, taking into account the spatial characteristics of CEE, the extended STIRPAT model and the spatial Durbin model are combined to further investigate the primary influencing factors of CEE. It is found that (1) the CEE of RCEP members is generally poor and unevenly distributed in temporal and spatial dimensions, with significant room for improvement and an overall positive spatial autocorrelation; (2) CEE varies considerably among RCEP members, with developed countries far outstripping developing countries in terms of both the current status and trend of CEE; (3) on a dynamic level, the GML index exhibits W-shaped fluctuations, with technological progress acting as the dominant force; and (4) in terms of spillover effects, affluence and economic agglomeration inhibit CEE enhancement, whereas technology level and investment capacity facilitate it. The findings will be useful in developing carbon-neutral plans for various countries as well as coordinated sustainable development for RCEP regions.

TI A Systematic Review of the Bottom/Base of the Pyramid Literature:
   Cumulative Evidence and Future Directions
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Sixteen years ago, Prahalad and Hart (Strategy + Business 26:2-14, 2002) introduced the possibility of both profitably serving the poor and alleviating poverty. This first iteration of the Bottom/Base of the Pyramid approach (known as BoP 1.0) focused on selling to the poor. In 2008, after ethical criticisms leveled at it, the field moved to BoP 2.0, instead emphasizing business co-venturing. Since 2015, we have witnessed some calls for a new iteration (BoP 3.0), with the focus broadening to a more sustainable development approach to poverty alleviation. In this paper, we seek to answer the question:How has the BoP approach evolved over the past 16 years, and has it delivered on its early promise?We conducted a systematic review of 276 papers published in journals in this period, utilizing a rigorous correspondence analysis method to map key trends, and then further examined the 22 empirical studies conducted on the BoP approach. Our results suggest that the field has evolved, passing through a number of trends and coming full circle-with our analysis pointing to more recent BoP literature emphasizing similar themes to those espoused in the initial BoP iteration (i.e., treating the BoP as consumers), rather than reflecting the principles espoused in either BoP 2.0 or BoP 3.0. Our analysis also points to a lack of clear evidence that the BoP concept has delivered on its promise either to businesses (that they can serve BoP markets profitably) or to BoP participants (that involvement by multinational corporations will help alleviate poverty).

TI Linkages between tourist resorts, local food production and the
   sustainable development goals
SO TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
AB The United Nations? Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ratified in 2015, are set to guide global development through to 2030. As an industry, tourism receives considerable attention in development discussions and in planning for development in the Global South, particularly in small island developing states (SIDS). A number of authors see particular prospects in the area of food producer linkages with the tourism industry, based on the notion that it should be possible to enhance both local food systems and tourism industries in SIDS by putting more local food on the menu. In this article, we test the assumption that building strong linkages between tourism and food production systems, especially agriculture and fisheries, is possible, and desirable, and would lead to more sustainable development. We do this by drawing on data from research in hotel kitchens and on farms in the South Pacific country of Fiji. When reflecting on the Fijian data in light of SDGs 2, 12 and 14, it is apparent that there are considerable constraints to developing food-tourism linkages in a way that will deliver more sustainable development in future. While ?island night? menus do use a lot of local produce, and small numbers of guests enjoy consuming Fijian foods at fine dining restaurants, incorporating local produce into mainstream resort menus had been difficult for chefs. Overall, the way large-scale multinational resorts are structured in terms of their food requirements does not make them ideal partners for food producers in developing countries, particularly SIDS.

TI Marketing complementary foods and supplements in Burkina Faso,
   Madagascar, and Vietnam: Lessons learned from the Nutridev program
SO FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB Background. Sustainable approaches to improving infant and young child feeding are needed. The Nutridev program worked in Vietnam, Madagascar, and Burkina Faso to test different strategies to improve complementary feeding using fortified products sold to families.
   Objective. To review the experiences of programs producing and marketing fortified complementary foods and to report on the feasibility of local production and marketing of fortified complementary foods to increase usage of high-quality foods among children of low-income families in a self-sustaining manner.
   Methods. Project documents, surveys of mothers, and production and sales reports were reviewed.
   Results. Nutridev experience in Vietnam, Madagascar, and Burkina Faso demonstrates that it is possible to produce affordable, high-quality complementary foods and supplements locally in developing countries. Strategies to make products readily available to the targeted population and to convince this population to consume them yielded mixed results, varying greatly based on the strategy utilized and the context in which it was implemented.
   Conclusions. In several contexts, the optimal approach appears to be strengthening the existing food distribution network to sell complementary foods and supplements, with the implementation of a temporary promotion and nutrition education network in partnership with local authorities (e.g., health services) to increase awareness among families about the fortified complementary food product and optimal feeding practices. In urban areas, where the density of the population is high, design and implementation of specific networks very close to consumers seems to be a good way to combine economic sustainability and good consumption levels.

TI Men and maternal health: The dilemma of short-lived male involvement
   strategies in Uganda
SO HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL
AB This article has been written to call for further attention to the importance of involving males in efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Since the 1995 International Conference on Population and Development [ICPD], institutional and community arrangements have been implemented in developing countries to engage males in maternal and child health promotions. The government of Uganda - in partnership with other health promotion institutions such as the United Nations agencies - has in the past decade formulated and implemented national and local strategies for male involvement in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR). Nevertheless, strategies are such as Male Action Groups (MAGs) have been short-lived because the strategies within cannot by themselves work without 'genuine' acceptance at community levels where implementation takes place. Even acceptance alone is also not enough. Majority of males have more interest in economic than social endeavors. They have less interest to engage in maternal health promotion initiatives. Cultural based perceptions and behaviors associated with patriarchal tendencies remain the greatest challenge. Therefore, relevancy, functionality, adaptability, and sustainability in relation to the effectiveness of male involvement initiatives must be assessed before these interventions are initiated in such culturally diverse communities with different informal institutional arrangements. The individual, interpersonal and institutional contexts in which interventions operate matters. The article identifies relevant stakeholders and suggests, though not discussed in detail, strategies for improving stakeholders' interests to respond to male involvement as a core issue in maternal health.

TI Sustainable Green Growth in Developing Economies: An Empirical Analysis
   on the Belt and Road Countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) initiated by the Chinese government could be regarded as a systematic framework for promoting economic cooperation and development among the countries along the Belt and Road and China. This paper attempts to analyze economic and environmental performance in 61 developing countries along Belt and Road. An additive total factor productivity growth measure allows aggregating contributions of individual countries along the BRI to construct a reasonable measure. Both desirable and undesirable outputs are considered. The growth in the total factor productivity is decomposed with respect to the economic and environmental contributions. The annual average growth rate of green productivity is 3.1%, and the disparity of economic and environmental performance could be observed among countries. Some countries show robust economic growth while environmental performance slows down green growth. This indicates that developing economies should pay attention to environmental impacts and promote sustainable development by sharing emission-reduction technologies.

AB The emerging need to tackle climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions has led to the consolidation of interest in renewable energy sources (RES) setting specific targets in the European area. To achieve the ambitious targets set, Member States are given the opportunity to cooperate with one or more of their developing neighboring countries. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodological framework based on the combination of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) methods for adopting the most appropriate strategic plan, in order to establish a successful energy cooperation that will create beneficial conditions for all the involved parties. The results could be important in facilitating decision makers to assess the role and design of this cooperation mechanism. Key insights will also emerge with regards to opportunities for energy strategy cooperation between Europe and its neighboring countries.

TI LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND MECHANISM OF MARINE FISHERIES SUBSIDIES IN THE
   ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO INDONESIA LAW REVIEW
AB Issues in fisheries have been regulated in various international conventions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS 1982) has built a regime in the field of conservation and management of fishery resources based upon maritime zones or fish species that exist and available in this zone. However, UNCLOS 1982 only focuses on the issue of fisheries in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas, thus it was not sufficient to overcome the problems of high frequent of fishing in maritime zones which are fully subject to the jurisdiction of coastal states, such as in the Inland waters, archipelagic waters and the Territorial Sea. This article aims to examine the legal framework and mechanisms of fisheries subsidies in the aspects of trade and sustainable development. In this article, discussion would carried out in order to examine the legal framework and mechanisms of marine fisheries subsidies that are implemented with the principles of fair-trade and sustainable development, both in the international level, as well as in the national level. Thus, this research is expected to be able to bridge the interests of developed countries and developing countries, especially Indonesia, in order to achieve fair trade in the field of fisheries and resource utilization of sustainable fisheries.

TI Identifying influential countries in air pollution control technologies:
   A social network analysis approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Clarifying the spatial correlation network of country-level air pollution control technology (APCT) is essential for transregional collaborative emission reduction in global warming. Previous research mainly focused on identifying the network structures of green technology linkages in a single country or region. In reality, cross-border technological cooperation has become a strategy for countries to achieve technological breakthroughs, and non-adjacent countries can be interconnected. Based on 217,392 patents, this study uses the Social Network Analysis method and Quadratic Assignment Procedure to discuss the spatio-temporal evolution and influence mechanisms of 57 countries' APCT spatial correlation network from 1990 to 2020. The results indicate the following: (1) The network density in APCT decreased from 0.428 to 0.355 between 1990 and 2020, and the overall network presents prominent core-periphery structural features. The developing countries accounted for 44.44% of the core area countries. (2) The United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Japan are at the center of the Americas, Europe, and Asia. (3) Narrowing the gap in greenhouse gas emissions in manufacturing industries and construction contributes to forming potential routes of multinational cooperation; however, the role of geographical distance becomes insignificant (0.282). Lastly, a multicenter knowledge flow network should facilitate global knowledge transfer, absorption, and sharing.

TI A framework for systemic sustainable construction industry development
   (SSCID)
SO DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
AB The quest for construction industry (CI) development in developing countries has met with several challenges. These challenges are numerous and varied. The study aimed to provide a framework by which the construction industry development agenda in developing countries could be prosecuted through a more structured and systemic approach. The qualitative research approach was adopted for the study. This approach was employed within the constructivist epistemological paradigm. Regarding information gathering, the study used the integrative literature review approach to elucidate the construction industry's nature and its proper systemic context. Complexity, interconnectedness, fragmentation, culture, and informality were found to be common challenges inherent in most CIs. Concerning the development of the industry, the approach was to (1) consider the industry as a system of systems (enabling the use of the principles of systems thinking and systems engineering), (2) apply the concepts of sustainable development as considered within the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and specified in the triple-bottom-line (TBL), i.e., the economic, environmental, and social dimensions, (3) identify the components of CI development (eight components were identified), which are: technology development, corporate development, human resource development, institutional development, material development, documentation, practice and procedure, and operating environment), and (4) Integrated studies. A conceptual framework was modelled from all the identified constructs. Based on this model, it was possible to propose a framework for assessing the maturity level of a country's sustainable construction industry development and, thereby, monitor its systemic development.

AB A large proportion of ornamental potted plants produced in developed countries are based on import of plant material from less developed countries, and most "potted plant species" originate in less developed countries. There are, however, an increasing awareness and concern about the intellectual property rights on native plant species and about economic sustainability at the grower and, particularly, at consumer level. Sustainable or "fair trade" is an alternative approach to conventional international trade. It is a trading partnership which aims at sustainable development for disadvantaged producers. Fair trade is well established within a range of edible horticultural products (coffee, tea and cocoa) and has been adapted to a range of other products but, as yet, not to ornamental horticultural products. It is obvious that fair trade, if adapted to ornamental horticulture, will not only create a whole new product line but may also create a new niche in the global potted plant market. Ornamental horticulture is an industry with great job opportunities and with a great potential for generating much needed export income. It is, however, difficult for small and medium sized businesses in developing countries to enter the export market for horticultural products, especially because the demands to the transport chain are high for horticultural products. It is evident that fair trade of ornamental plants will be a viable and sustainable business on a longer term, but this will require training and education and increased research into the practical aspects of plant export and reestablishment.

AB Internationalisation is a process by means of which the national tertiaiy education and research systems overlap in order tot innovate, value, and disseminate in a high efficient way the knowledge results. Should we consider the dynamics of this process, recent studies have shown an intensification of mobility one has never seen within the tertiary education level, of promoting programmes taught in foreign languages of international usage, of diversifying the types of international cooperation. Nevertheless, the internationalisation of tertiary education also involves a series of risks and challenges. According to our opinion, the main risk is connected to the loss due to migration of the most important resource, i.e., the human capital or brain-drain. Hence, internationalisation is also perceived as a way by which the talents are redistributed on a global scale, mostly often to the detriment of developing countries. Among the challenges we should mention the capacity to mobilize appropriate human and financial resources, in order to design sustainable public policies which would lead to an increase of the internationalisation level of university campuses and to extend cooperation with a view to developing systems of quality evaluation as regards teaching, learning and research.

TI River Water Pollution Status and Water Policy Scenario in Ethiopia:
   Raising Awareness for Better Implementation in Developing Countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Despite the increasing levels of pollution in many tropical African countries, not much is known about the strength and weaknesses of policy and institutional frameworks to tackle pollution and ecological status of rivers and their impacts on the biota. We investigated the ecological status of four large river basins using physicochemical water quality parameters and bioindicators by collecting samples from forest, agriculture, and urban landscapes of the Nile, Omo-Gibe, Tekeze, and Awash River basins in Ethiopia. We also assessed the water policy scenario to evaluate its appropriateness to prevent and control pollution. To investigate the level of understanding and implementation of regulatory frameworks and policies related to water resources, we reviewed the policy documents and conducted in-depth interviews of the stakeholders. Physicochemical and biological data revealed that there is significant water quality deterioration at the impacted sites (agriculture, coffee processing, and urban landscapes) compared to reference sites (forested landscapes) in all four basins. The analysis of legal, policy, and institutional framework showed a lack of cooperation between stakeholders, lack of knowledge of the policy documents, absence of enforcement strategies, unavailability of appropriate working guidelines, and disconnected institutional setup at the grass root level to implement the set strategies as the major problems. In conclusion, river water pollution is a growing challenge and needs urgent action to implement intersectoral collaboration for water resource management that will eventually lead toward integrated watershed management. Revision of policy and increasing the awareness and participation of implementers are vital to improve ecological quality of rivers.

TI Understanding climate policy integration in the global South through the
   multiple streams framework
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Actions needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change have often synergies and trade-offs with sectoral and sustainable development priorities, and the recent focus on SDGs and sustainable transitions highlights the need to integrate climate action into other policy spheres. This process is known as climate policy integration (CPI) or climate mainstreaming. Enhancing its understanding as a public policy making process can provide insights for its operationalization, which becomes relevant in the context of the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions in the global South. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the how windows of opportunity for CPI are formed by drawing on elements from the multiple streams framework (MSF) developed by John Kingdon. This paper analyses grey literature regarding two cases of climate mainstreaming initiatives implemented by international cooperation organizations. The results show that relevant elements from the MSF, such as, attachment to other high-profile national issues, timing the integration with routine institutional procedures, and the presence of policy entrepreneurs, have been catalysing factors for CPI in the context of such initiatives. However, we can only assess the value of this analytical framework for CPI by testing it systematically through case studies in a variety of contexts.

TI Towards urban-rural sustainable cooperation: Models and policy
   implication
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In the process of urbanization, many developing countries have had, or are being confronted with severe imbalance between urban and rural development, which causes serious un-sustainability. To address these challenges, this paper designs models to explore an 'urban-rural sustainable cooperation' pattern, with the idea of realizing 'green poverty reduction' in rural areas. Firstly, the infinitely repeated game model with trigger strategy is employed to prove the feasibility of establishing long-term urban-rural cooperation mode, with two conditions of low time preference rate and high efficiency of utilizing resource. Then this paper further discusses four requirements to enhance the accomplishment of green poverty reduction by cost-benefit analysis model: high antipollution costs afterwards, low time preference rate, the society's urgent need for environmental restoration, and high output gains without destroying environment. Lastly, this paper puts forward targeted policy proposals accordingly for relieving urban-rural imbalance problems in developing countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In March 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska. It was an environmental tragedy that revealed how ill prepared the nation's ports were for a major oil spill. It also had an unforeseen benefit: it helped launch a new cleanup industry, bio-remediation. The experience further underscored how central corporate responsibility has become to the country's reconciliation of its economic and environmental aspirations, especially if progress in cleaning up our air and water, which has been substantial the past quarter century, is to continue. This reconciliation lies at the heart of the concept of sustainable development. Sustainable development is not just about achieving greater efficiency in the use of energy and materials, which is important, but also envisions fundamental product innovation and the use of less materials. One dimension of the challenge of sustainable development is for government to craft incentives to foster innovation without prescribing corporate behavior. Another is to engage the developing world constructively on such critical issues as water and private investment, which can improve the lives of people, especially the poor. Without the cooperation of developing countries, it is unlikely that global environmental problems like climate change can be addressed effectively.

TI Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals: The Role for the G20 from
   China's Perspective
SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB Development became a G20 priority under the Korean presidency in 2010 and has remained central to global summitry ever since. Although the G20 has formally involved itself in the post-2015 process following the St. Petersburg Summit in 2013 and emphasized the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a core priority under Turkey's presidency in 2015, the UN remains the main channel for global negotiations and discussions of the post-2015 development agenda up to its approval and adoption in September 2015 and will continue to play the leading role in the follow-up implementation and tracking of SDGs. The present paper argues that as the SDGs come to dominate the agenda and action of donors and issues of financing take central stage, the G20 can play an important role in facilitating the implementation of the SDGs due to its various strengths, although it also faces serious challenges. The paper also points out that as the 2016 G20 chair, China can make great contributions in advancing the implementation of the SDGs both domestically and internationally.

TI Barriers to environmental sustainability of construction projects
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose The construction industry plays an important role in the achievement of the 11th and 15th of the Sustainable Development Goals. Efforts have been made by most developing and developed economies toward the achievement of these goals. Despite the efforts being made by the construction industry toward the achievement of these goals, there are still barriers that prevent built environment consultants from advancing environmental sustainability (ES) of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify barriers to ES of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review on barriers to the adoption of ES was conducted and face-to-face semi-structured interviews of purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana were carried out. Thematic template analysis of qualitative data was conducted. Findings The key findings from the study include perceived initial costs, lack of knowledge on ES, technological difficulties, external pressures in adopting ES practices and environmental conditions in developing countries. Originality/value The outputs of this study offer strategies which are very significant to the construction industry in embracing ES. Further, the findings contribute to knowledge on achieving the sustainable development agenda.

TI The Role of Remote Sensing in Assisted Development: Experience Drawn
   from Work in Over 40 Countries
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB . That there is great potential for remote sensing in development cannot be denied. As has often been said, everything happens somewhere, and remote sensing provides a very useful picture of everywhere. However, the use of remote sensing is often at a far lower level in broad development activities than one would expect, given its potential importance for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, Sustainable Development Goals, or the targets identified for the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Remote sensing can and should play a role in the 3 major stages of development assistance: identification of the need, program development and execution, and postcompletion program assessment and evaluation. This is so for almost all development activities involving resources, land, water, or the environment. There are a number of considerations and factors that, when taken together, explain the relatively low use of remote sensing in development. This study examines these considerations and factors drawing on the work, experience, and observations of the authors in more than 40 developing countries over the past 30years. The authors have worked in the area of remote sensing and development in Africa, Asia, South America, and the Pacific. With better understanding of these factors it is hoped that the benefits that have long been promised by the remote sensing community will be delivered.

TI Sustainable PPPs: A comparative approach for road infrastructure
SO CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY
AB The construction of road infrastructure is often a difficult issue for many countries. While many developing countries do not have public funds available, other developed countries experience public budget restrictions that limit the country's infrastructure development. Public private partnership (PPP) appears to be an adequate mechanism for empowering those countries, both developing and developed; in order to bring together the public and the private sector to find efficient ways for public services provision.
   Public private partnership is not, however, a panacea; instead a limited approach that is valid for feasible projects. Given the current economic context, it may be the only solution for road provision in some cases. Moreover, affordability limitations and viability conditions become key factors to make projects financially sustainable.
   From a case study analysis carried out on many projects in Europe, COST Action TU1001, Public Private Partnerships in Transport: Trends & Theory P3T3,(1) it may show evidence of key factors (or key performance indicators - KPIs) that might drive the projects to a success or failure. The idea of this paper, therefore, is to identify the elements for assessing sustainability in transport projects against these KPIs. A comparative analysis using 04 case studies (road projects) from Greece, Portugal, Spain and UK were chosen to achieve the main purpose of the paper.
   The findings and implications may be of interest at the time of implementing and designing a sustainable and efficient policy for road infrastructure. These study findings could also be considered when preparing a master programme for national roads. (C) 2015 World Conference on Transport Research Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
