TI Developing countries in a changing international order: coalitions and
   dispute settlement at the WTO
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL
AB This article analyzes developing countries performance at the World Trade Organization (WTO) accordingly to two aspects: developing country coalitions and developing country participation in the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The authors conclude that developing countries use institutional mechanisms as their main strategy in order to increase their capacity relatively to developed countries. Thus, developing countries have worked within the existing trade structure in order to try to adapt it to their interests. Developing countries have managed to create and maintain coalitions at the WTO, despite their economic and political diversity. As regards their participation in the DSB, although the number of panels opened by developing countries has increased, it is still concentrated in a small group of developing countries, mainly Brazil and India.

TI THE ROLE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The paper reviews critically the arguments concerning greater voice for Developing Countries in global governance. It supports the arguments for greater voice but argues that greater voice brings with it greater responsibilities in terms of the actions and commitments from Developing Countries. The two main illustrations are the multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO and the negotiations concerning climate change in the UN. In both case, it is argued, developing countries must assume greater responsibilities if these negotiations are to be concluded. This can be done in a way which yields net benefits to the Developing Countries themselves.

TI FOUR LESSONS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS OVER
   ACCESS TO MEDICINES
SO LIVERPOOL LAW REVIEW
AB After the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) came into operation in 1995 developing countries have found themselves in a process of continual negotiation over intellectual property rights and access to medicines. These negotiations have taken place in the World Trade Organization and in the context of free trade agreements. The paper suggests that the only real win for developing countries has been the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in 2001. What have been the lessons for developing countries in a decade of negotiations over access to medicines? Drawing on themes of rule complexity and regulatory ritualism the paper discusses four key lessons for developing countries. It concludes by arguing that developing countries will do better if they adopt a networked governance approach to negotiation rather than continuing to rely on traditional coalition formation.

TI Emerging Powers in the World Trading System: Contestation of the
   Developing Country Status and the Reproduction of Inequalities
SO GLOBAL SOCIETY
AB This article investigates discursive struggles over the boundaries of the categorisation of developing countries in the world trade regime. A key principle of the World Trade Organization (WTO) grants special rights to the group of developing countries. Recently, it has become highly contested whether emerging economies such as China can legitimately claim to belong to the group of developing countries. This article uncovers how old and new economic powers have tried to strategically (re)frame the boundaries of the developing country categorisation in the WTO. I argue that ongoing contestation reproduces inequalities because many developing countries are unwittingly negatively affected by the lack of formal criteria for classifying emerging economies-even if emerging economies themselves may benefit. In doing so, I illustrate how informal practices of classification may undermine the original intention of categorisation in International Organizations that aims to address inequality among its members.

TI Trade liberalization and state support of agriculture: effects for
   developing countries
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
AB The paper aims at the overview of the main approaches of state support implemented by developed and developing countries and the assessment of their distorting influences on the trade with agricultural commodities. The current state of state support is analyzed on the examples of EU-27, the USA and Japan. The experiences of developing countries are summarized on the examples of China, Russia and the CIS countries. State support tools are grouped according to the WTO classification. The alternative classification is implemented in order to compare the distorting effects caused by the state support. The EPACIS model is implemented to analyze the effects of trade liberalization for the distribution of agricultural commodities and trade policies in developing countries. The model is adjusted in order to assess the effects of state support for the production and trade with agricultural commodities in developing countries, recently accessed the WTO (the case of Russia). Imitation calculations allow formulating policies for the developing agricultural markets depending on the degrees of their sensitivity to foreign trade regulations and domestic support.

TI Who Are the Developing Countries in the WTO?
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The current world trading system lacks a procedure to identify developing country Members, to whom "Special and Differential Treatment" (SDT) is granted. Based on the analysis of five methods of identifying developing country Members, which are GATT Article XVIII definition, listing, classification, self-designation by SDT grantees, and selection by SDT grantors, we argue that "self-designation," which is widely claimed as the basic method of identifying developing country Members, gives them little certainty and predictability in their rights and obligations in the world trading system. A procedure that can make precise identification of SDT beneficiaries is indispensable in order to fulfill the WTO's objective of development.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS
CT Seminar on International Politics 2006
CY APR, 2006
CL Columbia Univ, New York, NY
HO Columbia Univ
AB The potential for international law to reduce power asymmetries depends on weaker countries learning to navigate the legal system. This paper examines the use of courts by developing countries to defend their trade interests. Power relations and low capacity may prevent these countries from fully participating in the international trade system. Yet some developing countries have been among the most active participants in GATT/WTO adjudication. We argue that high startup costs for using trade litigation are a barrier to developing country use of the dispute settlement process. Analysis of dispute initiation from 1975 to 2003 shows that past experience in trade adjudication, as either a complainant or a defendant, increases the likelihood that a developing country will initiate disputes. As weaker countries overcome these initial capacity constraints they will increasingly benefit from the international legal structures they have joined.

TI Developing countries and the World Trade Organization: A foreign
   influence approach
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper aims at providing an analytical examination of the criticism that the WTO is unfair and hurts the weak, developing countries. We utilize a formal model with the following features: in both the powerful and the weak economies, pressure groups lobby to influence their trade policies in their respective countries. We then allow the powerful country the exclusive ability to spend resources to facilitate the lobbying of one of the pressure groups in the weak country, thereby moving the trade policy of the developing country in favor of the powerful trading partner. Next we compare the effects of asymmetric foreign influence in a world with no WTO and no multilateral principles (most-favorednation principle, MFN, and the negotiation principle of reciprocity) to a situation with WTO and its associated non-discrimination principles. We show that the weak, developing country will have fewer 'unfair' concessions of market openings and in general will be better off with the WTO and with rules of non-discrimination.

TI Gaining influence in asymmetric negotiation The case of a developing-

SO ETUDES INTERNATIONALES
AB Inside an international institution such as the World Trade Organization (wto) where strong asymmetrical relations prevail, the weakest countries are generally disadvantaged. However, they can reverse the trend by developing coalitions as suggested by the theoretical literature. This is the route chosen by many developing countries in the wto. Over time, their coalitions have become much more effective in countering the claims of the most powerful countries which want to strengthen patent law. Coalition of developing countries that mobilized around issues of intellectual property and biopiracy countries has shown some success, which can be explained by the choice of a form combining strength and flexibility.

TI Impact of globalization on the construction sector in developing

SO CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB The international movement towards open markets promoted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has as its premise that trade liberalisation will benefit all concerned. Each country should be able to exploit its position of comparative advantage once a free and fair trade regime has been implemented. Although most commentators agree that in theory free trade should be beneficial, its implementation has been anything but beneficial for the developing countries. The construction sector falls under the provisions of the services negotiations of the WTO, and stands to experience the effects of trade liberalisation. Whether construction firms from the developing countries stand to gain or lose from this exposure to open competition is discussed in the light of the inequity with which the developing countries have been treated in the globalization of markets to date.

TI Reciprocal vs nonreciprocal trade agreements: Which have been best to
   promote exports?
SO PLOS ONE
AB The Doha Development Agenda recognizes the central role that international trade can play in the promotion of economic development. In fact, the increase of exports from developing countries to developed nations' markets has been considered a key element for developing countries to realize the potential benefits of globalization. Over the last decades, developed countries have provided preferential access to their markets to developing countries through nonreciprocal trade agreements. Moreover, developing countries have also participated in reciprocal trade agreements. This paper re-examines comparatively the effect of both kinds of trade agreements on exports from developing countries but also from the developed world. In line with other studies, our results across specifications are unstable. However, the results of our preferred specification give additional support to the argument raised by critics of nonreciprocal preference regimes who consider that developing countries should abandon their reliance on one-way trade preferences in favor of reciprocal agreements.

TI An offer developing countries could not refuse: how powerful states
   created the World Trade Organisation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Drawing on Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall's concept of institutional power, this article presents the empirically ascertained asymmetries created by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to investigate the Uruguay Round from a power standpoint. The argument is that developing countries, especially least developed nations, only accepted the WTO as a choice for the lesser of two evils. They are worse-off with the WTO trade regime, in contradiction to the positive-sum view of normative settings laid out by mainstream International Relations (IR) since the 1980s. The concept of institutional power is broken down into the sub-categories of 'go-it-alone' power, market power and forum-shifting power to demonstrate how the United States and the European Communities relied on their huge markets to shift the forum in charge of intellectual property and impose on developing countries a choice between accepting the WTO Agreement and being denied access to the world's two largest markets. Developing countries thus rationally became members of an organisation that entails absolute losses to them. The argument that institutions such as the WTO are desirable because they are agreed to does not reflect the realities of power and is ultimately an ideological stance that precludes mainstream IR from grasping how institutions (re)produce inequalities.

AB This article aims at analysing the merits and limits of 'cross-retaliation' as a mechanism to induce compliance in WTO dispute settlement, specifically from the perspective of developing countries. The focus is on cross-agreement retaliation, in particular with respect to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as this seems to be the most 'promising' area for developing countries. Although there are several legal, economic, and administrative difficulties related to the implementation of a suspension of TRIPS obligations and there is so far no practical experience, this seems to remain an interesting option for developing countries - or at least for the largest ones among them - wishing to obtain greater leverage in the system.

TI Interplay of innovation and standardization: Exploring the relevance in
   developing countries
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB A growing body of literature recognizes the positive interplay between innovation and standardization. International organizations such as OECD and WTO also increase support for developing countries in building capabilities in innovation and standardization. Yet the relationship between innovation and standardization in developing countries, characterized by relatively weaker technological, economic and institutional capacities, remain under-researched. We review 63 articles extracted from the Web of Science database covering the innovation-standardization nexus in the context of developing countries. We discuss whether and how the relationship between innovation and standardization provides implications for the socioeconomic development in developing countries, and draw a conceptual model to understand the dynamics. Our result shows that standards facilitate innovation in three ways: innovation by scaling, proving and coordinating. While inducing and blocking mechanisms are at play, various stakeholders are involved in the relationship. Among them, the roles of the government and the technology/industry support organizations are highlighted, as they complement the relatively weak technological capabilities of other actors. In contrast to the existing literature on developed countries where standardization is depicted as a dynamic process to shape the innovation path, the current discussion on developing countries is skewed toward the adoption aspect of standards. We also suggest that there is a chasm between the goals of economic growth and those of social development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Sustainability of the WTO Dispute Settlement System: Does It Work
   for Developing Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Our study provides an econometric analysis of whether developing countries are disadvantaged by the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) dispute settlement procedure. Despite the many successes of the Dispute Settlement Board (DSB), there is a need to better understand the overall effectiveness of the dispute mechanism. Using bilateral data of WTO members from 1995 to 2017, this article describes the influencing factors for developing countries' participation in the dispute settlement process. By conducting a rare events logistic regression analysis, the results from this study show that the key factors that determine the ability for a developing country to initiate a dispute against another country include the export intensity, retaliation capability, economic power, and economic threat from potential defendant countries. This means that not all developing countries can participate in trade dispute settlement mechanisms, so the WTO dispute settlement system has relative legitimacy. In addition, we further compare and analyse the influence of these four dimensions over different time periods and in different target countries through seemingly unrelated estimations.

TI Participation of Developing Countries in Dispute Settlement System of
   World Trade Organisation
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB Today the world economy is immeasurably more complex, multi-faceted, and integrated than it was in the last quarter of 20th century. New financial procedures and interests have multiplied in the current trade and investment matrix. Developing countries are now rightfully taking a much greater share in global production, trade and investment. However, their level of participation in the dispute settlement system is an important aspect of academic inquiry. There are several reasons for inadequate participation of developing countries but lack of trust is at the heart of the entire debate. Division amongst the developing countries placed them in more vulnerable position. This paper focuses on reasons for poor participation of some of the developing countries in the dispute settlement understanding (DSU), problems of developing and least developed countries and points out some measures for bringing required equilibrium in the dispute settlement system so that it could be made just, fair and equitable in near future.

TI INTERNATIONAL TRADE, WTO AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
SO WORLD REVIEW OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This article examines the existing literature on trade liberalisation and its effect on the economies of developing countries. It will also briefly examine the theory of comparative advantage which is seen as justification for global trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. This process is also associated with greater openness, economic interdependence and deepening economic integration with the world economy. The study is important because once again the international institutions strongly advocate trade and financial liberalisation in developing countries. The proponents of trade liberalisation argue that multilateral trade negotiations would achieve these goals, and poor countries particularly would benefit from it. However, such policies may increase vulnerability and make developing countries further hostages of international finance capital. Adoption of open market policies in agriculture would also mean the abandoning of self-reliance and food sovereignty, which may have wider consequences in terms of food shortages, food prices and rural employment.

TI Trade Policymaking in a Land-locked Developing Country: The WTO Review
   of Nepal
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB Sandwiched between India in the south, east and west and the People's Republic of China in the north, Nepal is a small landlocked developing country. Its trade policy autonomy is constrained by land-lockedness and open border with India. Despite opening up the economy, it has not fully benefited from openness, perhaps partly due to poor governance and partly due to transit and customs-related problems. Although these are crucial issues for trade competitive, The Trade Policy Review of Nepal 2012 (TPRN-2012) is either very polite or lacks a comprehensive analysis on most of these. Since transit-related costs faced by landlocked developing countries can be substantial, just evaluating the progress made in liberalising tariffs and nontariff barriers can provide a distorted picture of the overall business climate. The future WTO review reports on these countries should have a separate section on transit-related issues to contribute to policy debate on the problems of landlocked developing countries. Despite this, the publication of TPRN-2012 is very timely given the emphasis placed in the current policy debate in the WTO and other international forums on the problems of landlocked developing countries.

TI The global politics of intellectual property rights and pharmaceutical

SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB One of the major characteristics of the emerging international economic order is the treatment of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Developing country Members are very concerned about the impact that the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement' on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) will have on their, economies. Of particular concern are those aspects of the Agreement that relate to the issue of access to new pharmaceutical inventions. TRIPS emphasizes a property rights approach whereby,private "owners" of the inventions can restrict access on the basis of commercial considerations. As a consequence, higher prices, for pharmaceuticals and other healthcare inventions can prevent low-income consumers in developing countries from obtaining life-saving medications and equipment. It is true, of course, that exploitative business practices are possible only to the extent that monopoly positions are tolerated. Many developing countries, however, lack the necessary financial resources and have not yet developed appropriate competition rules to deal effectively with the challenges presented by the TRIPS Agreement.

TI The GATS and trade in health services: implications for health care in
   developing countries
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The literature on the GATS and trade in health services is limited, largely speculative, and polarised between `trade' and `health systems' perspectives. The distinctive features of the market for health services, particularly in developing countries, means that the `benefits of trade' argument is not applicable: the potential economic benefits of trade in health services are limited, while its potential effects on health systems, particularly through the supply of health professionals to public services, are substantially negative in almost all developing countries. GATS commitments have not encouraged trade, and there is little reason to anticipate this, except possibly in Mode 3; but they seriously constrain health policy. The effectiveness of GATS safeguard provisions is at best doubtful; and the stronger domestic regulation needed in open health service markets is beyond the capacity of most developing countries. Proposed GATS-consistent regulations to offset adverse effects of trade in health services are untested, unrealistic, impracticable, ineffectual, and/or have serious limitations or adverse side-effects. GATS commitments are binding, backed by sanctions, and of indefinite duration; but key provisions are ambiguous, and the future extent, nature and effects of trade in health services very uncertain. Analysis and data are very limited and analytical frameworks undeveloped. There is thus no basis for informed decision-making on GATS commitments; and decision-making processes mean that health considerations play a very limited role. Therefore, the GATS framework is inappropriate as a basis for international rules on trade in health services; and it is undesirable for developing countries to make GATS commitments in the health sector.

SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper explains the export promotion measures that can be utilised by developing countries under the current World Trade Organization (WTO) system and compares the WTO Members proposals on modification of export promotion provisions in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations. Non-reciprocity between developed countries and developing countries in favour of the latter needs to be strengthened in modifying the current WTO regulations, because of the very different levels of economic development between those two groups of countries. Therefore, from the viewpoint of distributional fairness, it suggests ways of modifying special and differential treatment provisions applied to export promotion policies of developing economies in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures of the WTO.

Notwithstanding the tremendous expansion in world trade, only a few developing countries have been able to take advantage of the rules-based multilateral trading system. A significant number of developing countries have jettisoned import substitution policies and adopted export-oriented development strategies. Concerned about the marginalisation of some of these countries, the WTO has adopted a number of measures aimed at ensuring that all countries benefit from the rule-based multilateral trading system.

SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB Free trade agreements have become a central feature of many developing countries' growth strategies, encouraged by an evaluation literature that quantifies their positive impact on trade. However, trade gains come at the cost of policy space, particularly when the partner is a developed country, and though this cost has been acknowledged, its impact has not been explored. This article seeks to address this oversight by detailing changes to the domestic policy environment from the participation of a developing country in a US-anchored FTA and evaluating whether the resulting policy regime is flexible enough to enable a developmental government to pursue activities associated with industrialisation.

AB China's export restraints on rare earths were the subject of a trade dispute with the European Union, Japan and the United States in the World Trade Organization. The decision of the WTO Appellate Body in the China - Measures related to the Exportation of Rare Earths, Tungsten and Molybdenum ('China - Rare Earths') case carries important consequences for developing countries that rely heavily on the resources and mining sector. Developing countries have often used export restraints to achieve varied objectives such as economic development and environmental protection. Export restraints are viewed as trade distortive and violative of the WTO norms. Therefore, developing countries face a complicated challenge on how to structure export restraint regimes that are WTO consistent and which allow domestic policy goals to be achieved. This article reviews the future of export restraints after the China - Rare Earths decision.

TI A New Politics of Confrontation? Brazil and India in Multilateral Trade
   Negotiations
SO GLOBAL SOCIETY
AB Particularly in the North-South confrontation at the Cancun Ministerial Conference in 2003, developing countries seemed to be presenting a unified stance of resistance against the developed world. These developments were greeted with considerable surprise in the scholarly as well as policy communities, not least because many theorists of International Relations had predicted increasing homogenisation and policy convergence by developing countries around liberal solidarist norms. In this paper, we analyse the apparent revitalisation of the Third World, and evaluate the policies of developing countries at and around Cancun to assess the claims that this heralds a more activist and less accommodating period in North/South relations. We buttress this general analysis by probing further into the policies of two of the major players, namely Brazil and India. We argue that recent policy changes can be explained by learning and adaptation by developing countries within the specific institution of the World Trade Organisation. We examine this adaptation along four planes: coalitions, insider activism, negotiation strategies, and transnational coalitions. Domestic politics in both our country cases play, at best, a supportive role. We also investigate the extent to which these shifts in trade politics might be seen as broader shifts in foreign policy.

AB The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established the World Trade Organization to supervise the reduction of barriers to, and liberalisation of, world trade. The application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures will be standardised to avoid use for protectionist purposes by countries or regional trade blocks. Harmonisation of animal disease control measures within regional blocks is essential if benefits to freer trade are to occur, but this harmonisation must be balanced against potential disease risks and costs associated with disease outbreaks. World trade in livestock products is concentrated among developed countries, although developing countries are responsible for approximately a third of poultry meat imports and exports. Despite liberalisation, the share of global trade by developing countries is unlikely to increase greatly in the short term. The benefits of trade and of freer trade are emphasised. Examples are given of the impacts of trade barriers on developing countries and of the harmonisation of European Union animal health standards. Economic implications for the future of greater global trade are assessed.

TI Cartels and Collusion in Developing Countries: Lessons from Empirical
   Evidence
SO WORLD COMPETITION
AB During the course of the debate at the WTO on the Singapore issues, a number of government officials from developing countries have suggested that their countries would derive little benefit from competition law enforcement. Some even argued that competition law enforcement would actually hinder the development of their country. To a large extent these views were based on the idea that domestic anticompetitive practices are not prevalent on developing economies or do not impose a large cost on their economies. This discussion on the relationship between trade competition and development, however, has remained fairly abstract in multilateral fora. This article attempts to look at the reality of anticompetitive practices around the turn of the century in developing countries by drawing from numerous public sources to identify the types of anticompetitive practices most frequently observed or alleged by type and sectors. The analysis shows that the economies of developing countries are subject to a wide array of anticompetitive practices, that such practices not only hurt consumers in developing countries but also affect the competitivity of the economies of these countries, and that they are often similar across countries. The policy implications of such findings are discussed in the last section.

TI Mega-regional trade agreements and non-participating developing
   countries: Differential impacts, challenges and policy options
SO COMPETITION & CHANGE
AB Mega-regional trade agreements imply several challenges for developing countries. Some are due to the impacts of economic growth within areas of new discriminatory preferential access, while others are produced by the long-term implications of mega-regional trade agreements on global trade governance. These challenges are likely to increase as more mega-regional trade agreements with large economic size, regulatory ambition and geo-strategic significance are negotiated and signed. The implications of these challenges are significant for developing countries outside the mega-regional trade agreements, particularly the least-developed countries. This paper examines some of the major challenges from mega-regional trade agreements for non-participating developing countries, with attention to the drivers of these agreements, their economic impacts, the difficulties encountered by the World Trade Organization following emergence of mega-regional trade agreements, and possible strategic responses to these trade agreements. Underlining the differential impacts of mega-regional trade agreements on non-participating developing countries, the paper concludes that larger economies like China and India are likely to be less affected due to their economic size and strategic influence, compared with the least developed countries.

First of all, an introductory paragraph will be devoted to the current situation of this international organization, which appears difficult because of the Doha Round negotiating cycle stalling and the harsh criticism moved by the United States. Arguments will be made concerning United States claims, in order to understand this criticism, probably the most dangerous threat to WTO's life from its inception. Attention will then be focused on the WTO's agricultural discipline, one of the main subject of the WTO legal order and one of most controversial as well. This section will describe existing rules and rules that have been proposed to accomodate agricultural issues in a way Developing Countries may find acceptable to protect their interests and needs. This will bring to the conclusive section, which discusses the troublesome 'food security' issues.

TI China and the WTO: From Difficult Access to Partial Leadership
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB This paper has explored the interactions between China and the WTO, arguing that it can be divided into three different stages, ranging from difficult access to comprehensive adaptation and to partial leadership. Through the three stages, the conflict and resolution of the dilemmas of market economy status and developing country status is the driving force. In the difficult access period, the market economy dilemma embodies the optional safeguard measures and antidumping measures and the developing country dilemma embodies the access to the market of finance, insurance, and telecommunication in the negotiation of China's entry to the GATT/WTO. In the comprehensive adaption period, China, out of defending its own market economy status, has been using the WTO rules to counter America's demands on China such as anti-dumping proceedings and the criticism of "stagnation of China's reform". Meanwhile, China still has been sticking to its special and differential treatment of developing country status. In the period of partial leadership, while insisting that it is a developing country, China has strategically advocated that developing countries should realize its national interest by adopting the new policy of "open for development", embodying its leadership in the emerging issues of WTO negotiations such as the e-commerce and investment facilitation.

TI NON-LINEAR EFFECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ON TECHNOLOGICAL
   INNOVATION: EVIDENCE FROM EMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SO ECONOMICS AND FINANCE LETTERS
AB The protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is a key determinant of innovation. Following the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), all member states of the World Trade Organization are called upon to introduce high intellectual property rights standards. Hence the importance of the issue relative to IPR. Recent studies suggest that IPR protection stimulates innovation only under certain conditions. In this study, we suppose that IPR have a positive impact on technological innovation only in countries with high levels of economic development. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between intellectual property rights, economic development and technological innovation in the context of emerging and developing countries. To measure innovation, we use patent applications filed by residents of a given country with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. IPR is measured by the Ginarte and Park index. Panel Threshold Regression is applied to data of 55 emerging and developing countries for the period 1980-2009. The estimation results provide evidence for the existence of nonlinear relationship depending on economic development level. We conclude that "one size does not fit all".

TI The most-favored nation rule in principle and practice: Discrimination
   in the GATT
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB The conflicts of interest that prevailed between the great powers in the wake of the First World War eviscerated their ability to respond collectively to the advent of the Great Depression. Instead, each turned to discriminatory trade barriers and trade blocs to try to revive domestic output. Persuaded that trade discrimination exacerbated the political tensions that erupted in World War II, policy makers constructed a postwar economic order that institutionalized nondiscrimination. Thus, Article 1 of the charter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) mandates most-favored nation (MFN) treatment. We argue here that the MFN clause itself encouraged the adoption of practices and policies that actually recreated discrimination. In particular, we argue, developing countries, long regarded as victims of discrimination, institutionalized it in their negotiations with each other. We examine two developing country PTAs that included about 80 percent of all developing-country GATT members by output (the Global System of Trade Preferences and the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations). We show that as in the GATT writ large, their patterns of tariff cuts and trade expansion were highly skewed toward a small number of their largest members. In trying to avoid discrimination, policy makers actually encouraged its de facto adoption.

AB The Doha 'Development' Round of trade negotiations at the WTO has featured agricultural trade liberalisation as one of its key aims. But developing countries were frustrated with both the process and the content of the agricultural agreement negotiations early on in the round. This prompted these countries, through a number of developing country groupings such as the G-20 and others, to call for changes in the talks to ensure that developing country voices and concerns were heard. Although developing countries were in many ways successful in registering their concerns in the latter half of the negotiations, and have maintained a fairly high degree of cohesion across the Global South, it remains unclear whether this cohesion will last as the uneven impacts of agricultural trade liberalisation become apparent.

SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB The impact of intellectual property protection in the pharmaceutical sector on developing countries has been a central issue in the fierce debate during the past 10 years in a number of international fora, particularly the World Trade Organization (WTO) and WHO. The debate centres on whether the intellectual property system is: (1) providing sufficient incentives for research and development into medicines for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries; and (2) restricting access to existing medicines for these countries. The Doha Declaration was adopted at WTO in 2001 and the Commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public Health was established at WHO in 2004, but their respective contributions to tackling intellectual property-related challenges are disputed. Objective parameters are needed to measure whether a particular series of actions, events, decisions or processes contribute to progress in this area. This article proposes six possible benchmarks for intellectual property-related challenges with regard to the development of medicines and ensuring access to medicines in developing countries.

AB Increasing legalization of international institutions has divergent effects on member countries. Whereas legalization decreases uncertainty and increases convergence of countries' expectations on international outcomes, it imposes costs on countries by increasing the complexity and difficulty of procedures for them to utilize. Countries with the administrative capacity to follow elaborate procedures reap the benefits of increased legalization. For countries without such capacity-primarily developing countries-the potential benefits are offset by their difficulty in following the procedures. I examine this argument against the institutional changes in dispute settlement procedures that occurred in the transition from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Compared to the GATT era, developed countries-ones with greater capacity-are much more likely to utilize dispute settlement in the WTO than developing countries. Gains from the institutional changes in dispute settlement procedures have accrued to benefit mostly developed member countries in the WTO.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB Critical appraisals of the current and potential benefits from developing country engagement in the WTO focus mainly on the Doha Round of negotiations. This paper examines a different aspect of developing country participation in the WTO: use of the WTO dispute settlement system to enforce foreign market access rights already negotiated in earlier rounds of multilateral negotiations. We examine data on developing country use from 1995 through 2008 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to enforce foreign market access. The data reveal three notable trends: developing countries' sustained rate of self-enforcement actions despite declining use of the DSU by developed countries, developing countries' increased use of the DSU to self-enforce their access to the markets of developing as well as developed countries, and the prevalence of disputes targeting highly observable causes of lost foreign market access, such as antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. The paper also examines how introduction of the Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL) into the WTO system in 2001 has affected developing countries' use of the DSU to self-enforce their foreign market access rights. A first pass at the data indicates that developing country use of the ACWL mirrors their use of the DSU more broadly; the ACWL has had little effect in terms of introducing new countries to DSU self-enforcement. A closer look at the data reveals evidence on at least three channels through which the ACWL may be enhancing developing countries' ability to self-enforce foreign market access: increased initiation of sole-complainant cases, more extensive pursuit of the DSU legal process for any given case, and initiation of disputes over smaller values of lost trade.

SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB In terms of General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) principles and the efforts of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), nations have been urged to eliminate or reduce trade barriers. Yet the inequality in the global trading regime has had an impact on developing countries. The majority of WTO members are developing countries, mostly from Africa. This article contributes to the debate on whether trade liberalization helps to alleviate poverty and promote development, with a focus on Africa. Through a detailed review of literature and documents relating to trade barriers and trade liberalization, a critical qualitative assessment is undertaken of their impact for developing countries, with special reference to Africa. In doing so, the impact of the efforts of the WTO as a forum for international trade negotiations, is examined and the challenges with respect to development in Africa are highlighted. The conclusions to the study point out that free trade is a pre-requisite for growth in Africa, but does not guarantee such growth and development; that trade liberalization may not on its own necessarily lead to growth in Africa; and that there is a need for initiatives outside the WTO agreements, such as South-South, intra-Africa agreements, including regional trade agreements.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the critical issue of legal interpretation on the "development question" as they arise before WTO panels and Appellate Body, in view of the benefits inherent in a more-rounded consideration of the development needs and concerns of WTO developing country Member States.
   Design/methodology/approach - The introduction sets out the background to the challenges of developing countries in utilising the dispute settlement process effectively and using existing support. By analysing relevant cases, Section 2 analyses the "development question" and how it has been so far considered in legal interpretation. Section 3 addresses WTO jurisprudence on development, examining situations wherein "development" arises in the course of WTO dispute settlement. An examination as to how this aspect of WTO jurisprudence may be revisited including the potential aid of trade policy review mechanisms, and procedures for enforcement is then undertaken. It concludes on the position that the WTO judicial review process can work better by providing the much-needed balance between binding global trade rules and the domestic progress of its developing country membership at the level of dispute settlement.
   Findings - This paper establishes the importance of recognising and addressing the fact that core challenges and concerns facing developing countries can and should be factored into the legal interpretation of issues in dispute settlement.
   Originality/value - A decisive enquiry into WTO development jurisprudence, this paper addresses developing country capacity to pursue the legal opportunities promised by the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, and how this can be redressed.

TI Modeling agricultural innovation in a rapidly developing country: the
   case of Chinese pesticide industry
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Technology and innovation play an increasingly important role in the economic development of both developed and developing countries. We investigate how policy and market factors influence firms (or other potential inventors) decisions on innovation or imitation by developing a model that emphasizes expected market size, appropriability and technological opportunity. We empirically test the model using provincial pesticide innovation data from a rapidly developing country, China. We find that the government encouraged local innovation by opening regions to more international trade, by increasing investments in public research and education, and by strengthening intellectual property right (IPR) enforcement to meet its WTO TRIPS obligations. Moreover, while IPR enforcement and increases in market size are important in encouraging innovation, empirical evidence is mixed as inventors respond to these factors differently. Policies to increase expected market size could increase copying rather than inducing R&D investments, and extended patent life may reinforce the original standing of infringers as well as inventors.

TI Institutional quality and the effectiveness of aid for trade
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Trade policy barriers and high transaction costs hinder developing countries from taking the full advantages of the global trading system. In order to help developing countries overcome the problem, the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Aid for Trade (AFT) initiatives in its Ministerial Conference held in Hong Kong in 2005. We examine the effects of AFT inflows on bilateral trade costs facing 133 developing countries while accounting for differences in their location on the contours of various measures of institutional quality. Our results from the estimation of a mixed effects (random-intercept and random-coefficient) model indicate that institutional quality significantly affects the extent to which AFT reduces bilateral trade costs. An important policy implication of our findings is that an economically robust and sustainable reduction in bilateral trade costs facing developing countries requires the presence of both promulgated and effectively functioning institutions such as regulatory power and the rule of law.

TI Do Developing-country WTO Members Receive More Aid for Trade (AfT)?
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB Since the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations started in 2001, the importance of aid for trade (AfT) has been well recognised as a useful tool for facilitating trade, economic growth and social development in developing countries. At the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference in December 2005, the AfT initiative' was launched and many high-income member countries pledged to increase their AfT contributions, particularly for the least developed member countries (LDC). This paper aims to assess whether and to what extent the WTO's developing member countries have received more AfT. For this purpose, a system generalised method of moments is applied to a sample of 118 recipient countries for the period 2001-10. We find evidence that while LDC WTO members on average receive relatively more AfT than other developing countries, the difference has not increased since launch of the AfT initiative. Among the three categories of AfT, the positive WTO membership effect for LDC members increased for building productive capacity and for trade policy and regulation, but declined for infrastructure.

TI Protecting biotechnology IPRs in developing countries: Simple analytics
   of a levy solution
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB High transaction costs and an absence of institutional infrastructure in developing countries prevent comprehensive enforcement of intellectual property rights and generate obstacles to the adoption of genetically modified (GM) crop technology. Governments of developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization are faced with two options when licensing GM crop technology: (1) attempt to regulate GM crops to the standards of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) or (2) allow a black market in GM seeds and risk trade retaliation from the GM innovator's host country through a TRIPS trade complaint. This paper develops a conceptual model that frames the adopting country's range of licensing options, including a new levy system, and derives welfare measures for each option. The model illustrates how a levy on GM technology can be a welfare-increasing policy for developing countries, and the operation of a levy is discussed. The conceptual model is applied to Brazil's soybean market and quantitative economic surplus measures are estimated within a calibrated welfare model for a range of licensing scenarios. The model's results suggest that a levy may interfere with the long-term prospects for innovators to collect monopoly rents in adopting countries.

TI TOWARDS AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BARGAINING THEORY: THE POST-WTO ERA
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB This Article proposes a positive bargaining theory for intellectual property-based technologies in the post-World Trade Organization ("WTO") era. It focuses on negotiations between patent-sensitive industries and developing countries over legal endowments and access conditions in an archetypical patent-sensitive industry, namely the pharmaceutical industry. The ability of developing countries to issue, or threaten to issue, compulsory licenses over pharmaceutical products serves as a working example.
   This Article's analysis of the bargaining power possessed by developing countries combines a conventional assessment of market size with a qualitative analysis that highlights the effects of these countries' propensity to innovate. The ensuing bargaining situation yields numerous insights, the primary ones being as follows: First, innovation in intellectual property-based technologies, such as within the fields of pharmaceuticals, software, information communication technologies ("ICTs"), and plant genetics, creates a paradoxical effect within the group of innovative Newly Industrialized Countries ("NICs"). The paradox is based on the notion that innovation weakens, rather than boosts, the countries' bargaining power vis-a-vis the prospect of bargaining retaliations. This is conspicuously the case of the prospect of issuing compulsory licenses over pharmaceutical patents.
   Second, the resulting bargaining dynamic deemphasizes the practical significance of the Least-Developed-Country ("LDC") carve-out contained in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS") and other WTO agreements. Specifically, it is argued that distributive justice policies contained in TRIPS should be geared toward a broader group of weak developing countries extending beyond the group of LDCs. This theory points out a tentative threefold typology of developing countries defined based on their bargaining power. Accordingly, developing countries are modeled as HBPs, MBPs, and LBPs depending on whether they are relatively high, medium, or low-bargaining power countries, respectively.
   In its conclusion, this Article contends, based on the model presented, that strong protection of intellectual property rights could have significant negative allocation consequences for developing countries. Such is the case without contributing to-and even impeding-their technological development. Arguably, the HBP-MBP-LBP underlying developmental inequality shifts the optimal balance between static and dynamic efficiencies. In that sense, TRIPS may prove ineffective in promoting dynamic long-term innovation policies for developing countries.

TI Globalization and Paradoxes of Ethical Transnational Production: Code of
   Conduct in a Chinese Workplace
SO COMPETITION & CHANGE
AB Neo-liberal economic globalization and acceleration in information and communication technologies have strengthened the competitiveness of transnational corporations by making it easier for them to stretch their global commodity chains to developing countries. Such control from a distance threatens national states' capacity to regulate TNCs and their impact upon environment, labour and human rights in developing countries. This has prompted anti-TNC sentiments and campaigns that challenge brand-named TNCs on labour exploitation in the south. These changes have triggered discussions on setting labour standards in the international arena. With the WTO distancing itself from the 'social clause', this has prompted the TNCs, NGOs and other stakeholders to self-regulate by introducing codes of conduct. Concentrating on the clothing industry, this paper examines the emergence of company and multi-stakeholder codes of conduct that require the involvement of subcontractors and NGOs in developing countries. The moving of ethical codes to developing countries condenses and reproduces, under the twin pressures of competitiveness and social auditing, the paradoxes of ethical transnational production in the internal organizations of local firms. These paradoxes are demonstrated from a case study of a workplace in China. The paper ends by outlining three paradoxes and commenting on the development of a managerialist 'audit culture' in workplace practices as commodification of ethical code.

TI Hungry for free trade? Food trade and extreme hunger in developing
   countries
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB One of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century is to ensure that the world population has reliable access to adequate, affordable and nutritious food sufficient to avoid hunger. Agricultural trade liberalization is often considered a central element of economic strategies aiming at improving food security in developing countries. Many, however, argue that most developing countries may not benefit from freer agricultural trade and that liberalization may accentuate food insecurity. From an empirical perspective, little is known about the effects of trade on food security in developing countries. We estimated the effects of food trade openness on extreme hunger in developing countries using a novel two-step approach. First, we estimated the reverse causal impacts of hunger on food trade openness using rainfall anomalies as instrumental variables to generate exogenous variation in hunger. In a second step, we estimated the effect of food trade openness on hunger using the residual food trade openness that is not driven by hunger as an instrument. We found that a 10% increase in food trade openness would increase the prevalence of undernourishment by about 6%. We also found evidence that developing countries reduce food trade openness as a response to increased hunger, suggesting protectionist policies. A percentage point increase in undernourishment prevalence would decrease food trade openness by 0.9%. Our results suggest that countries may be better off adopting food self-sufficiency for some time, despite such actions clashing with World Trade Organization's regulations and current agenda.

TI Handling WTO Disputes with the Private Sector: The Triumphant Brazilian
   Experience
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Multiple scholarly works have argued that developing country Members of World Trade Organization (WTO) should enhance their dispute settlement capacity to successfully and cost effectively navigate the system of WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). It is one thing to be a part of WTO agreements and know the WTO rules, and another to know how to use and take advantage of those agreements and rules in practice. The present investigation seeks to conduct a detailed examination of the latter with a specific focus on critically examining public private partnership (PPP) strategies that can enable developing countries to effectively utilize the provisions of WTO DSU. To achieve this purpose, the article examines how Brazil, one of the most active DSU users among developing countries, has strengthened its DSU participation by engaging its private stakeholders during the management of WTO disputes. The identification and evaluation of the PPP strategies employed by the government and industries in Brazil may prompt other developing countries to determine their individual approach towards PPP for the handling of WTO disputes.

TI Animal welfare and developing countries: opportunities for trade in
   high-welfare products from developing countries
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB Discussion on the potential for developing countries to develop trade in niche markets such as higher welfare standards has been highlighted with moves by the World Organisation for Animal Health (DIE) to set internationally agreed standards for animal welfare. This paper examines the existing and potential trade in value-added higher welfare products using case studies in the beef and poultry sectors from three countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It shows that at present there is only a small trade in these products but that this can have a major effect at a national level. In the beef export trade from Namibia, the existence of the only assurance scheme in Africa setting standards in hygiene, veterinary care and animal welfare has created a trusted, safe and healthy product and ensured that Namibia has grown into Africa's largest exporter of beef to the European Union. In Thailand, the broiler industry, which has enjoyed annual growth in the past 15 years, is developing value-added products to develop markets to counter competition from other countries. The development and implementation of standards for organic products in both Thailand and Argentina over the past decade have also resulted in growth in the export markets of these products. The paper concludes that there is growth potential for the sectors in all three markets which can be assisted by the development of DIE baseline standards.

   their contents
SO AGRICULTURAL TRADE AND POVERTY MAKING: POLICY ANALYSIS COUNT
CT Global Forum on Agricultural Trade Reform, Adjustment and Poverty
CY MAY 23-24, 2002
CL PARIS, FRANCE
SP OECD
AB An important component of the current debate about agriculture trade negotiations is whether further liberalisation of trade and agricultural policies may help or hinder food security in WTO member countries. To contribute to the debate, this paper surveys and discusses in detail three main aspects of trade liberalisation and food security within the WTO: the adequacy of the current WTO classification of countries, the policy perspectives in industrialised countries and in developing countries, and the legal issues faced by developing countries, with particular consideration of different special and differential treatment proposals.
   The authors make a case first for a better classification of WTO members based on objective food-security indicators to target food insecure countries. Second, they argue that the main imbalances in world agriculture is that industrialised countries have enough legal room under the WTO to subsidise their own agriculture and the resources to do it, while many developing countries although not legally constrained to invest in food security, lack the financial, human, and institutional resources to do it. The pay off to developing countries would be greater if they limit the ample legal room industrialised countries now have to protect and subsidise their agriculture rather than try to expand further their own SDT. Yet, food insecure developing countries may need streamlined instruments to protect poor farmers from unfair trade practices and import surges, and require adequately long transition times linked to a program of investment in rural development and poverty alleviation. This should be recognised by ensuring that agricultural trade negotiations proceed in parallel with increased funding by international and bilateral organisations for agricultural and rural development, food security, and rural poverty alleviation.

Emerging powers like China, India and Brazil have portrayed themselves as leaders of the Global South, crusading to make the trading system fairer for developing countries. This article analyzes three cases - the cotton dispute, subsidies and public stockholding - that have been at the center of WTO negotiations and dispute settlement on agriculture since the collapse of the Doha Round. While presenting themselves as champions of the developing world, I show that the emerging powers have been advancing their own interests, often at the expense of other developing countries.

SO LANCET
AB The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) set global minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property, substantially increasing and expanding intellectual-property rights, and generated clear gains for the pharmaceutical industry and the developed world. The question of whether TRIPS generates gains for developing countries, in the form of increased exports, is addressed in this paper through consideration of the importance of pharmaceuticals in health-care trade, outlining the essential requirements, implications, and issues related to TRIPS, and TRIPS-plus, in which increased restrictions are imposed as part of bilateral free-trade agreements. TRIPS has not generated substantial gains for developing countries, but has further increased pharmaceutical trade in developed countries. The unequal trade between developed and developing countries (ie, exporting and importing high-value patented drugs, respectively) raises the issue of access to medicines, which is exacerbated by TRIPS-plus provisions, although many countries have not even enacted provision for TRIPS flexibilities. Therefore this paper focuses on options that are available to the health community for negotiation to their advantage under TRIPS, and within the presence of TRIPS-plus.

TI Late industrialization in the Sustainable Development Goals: a critical
   perspective from the Argentine experience
SO GLOBALIZATIONS
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have incorporated late industrialization once more into the global development agenda. Nonetheless, the importance that is given to WTO's rules in the SDGs makes it pertinent to re-examine the debate about the 'policy space' in which developing countries pursue late industrialization. The premise in the SDGs is that WTO's rules will demarcate the policy space developing countries will have to pursue industrial policies. This article argues that the WTO could demarcate the 'policy space' only if developing countries lack access to non-conditional external finance. The accessibility of low-conditionality sources of external financing permits countries to avoid conditionalities and hence widen the space to use policy instruments inconsistent with the neo-liberal rational the SDGs industrial agenda vindicates. Argentina's re-industrialization programme (2003-2015) is used to illustrate how having access to low-conditional external finances allowed Argentina to escape WTO's rules to implement State-led industrial policies after a default.

Between 2002 and 2011, 46% and 36% of the agricultural products from the DCs and LDCs, respectively, were imported under the GSP scheme. However, most of the agricultural products from DCs and LDCs entered Switzerland under a most favoured nations (MFN) of zero. The estimations of a gravity model underpin the findings of the descriptive analysis: Being simultaneously a member of the WTO and in the GSP scheme fosters agro-food imports from DCs and LDCs significantly. Furthermore, the productivity and supply capacity within the agricultural sector depicted by the agriculture gross domestic product of a trading partner has a strong and significant positive effect on imports.

TI Differential treatment for developing countries in the WTO: the unmaking
   of the North-South distinction in a multipolar world
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB This article examines the implications of the rise of new powers in the Global South for a central principle of global order: the distinction between the 'North' and the 'South', or 'developed' and 'developing countries', that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century. In doing so, we assess whether, and if so, how, the increasing tension between the binary 'North-South' distinction and growing heterogeneity within the Global South - as evidenced by the rise of emerging economies - has been reflected in the rules of multilateral trade policymaking. In the case of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the 'North-South' categorisation forms the basis of the legal principle of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) that grants special rights to developing countries. To trace the evolution of SDT, we analyse legal developments and processes of contestation based on our conceptualisation of possible options for adaptation: graduation, individualisation and fragmentation. Drawing on a dataset of WTO decisions and agreements from 1995 to 2019, we find that the group of developing countries increasingly competes with other groups of disadvantaged countries for equity-based differential treatment. The resulting fragmentation contributes to the unmaking of the North-South distinction as a central ordering principle in global trade politics.

Food quality, safety and labelling issues are explored along with their implication on global trade and on the livelihood of farmers concerned. The role of local governments, international institutions (WTO, ISO, Codex Alimentarius) alongside the rise of public as well as private standards in food safety are highlighted. The roles of stakeholder collaboration, capacity building, corporate involvement etc., in the development of safe and efficient food chains are discussed. Case studies from selected agriculturally resourcerich countries are included. Finally, we provide important policy-level recommendations required to strengthen food safety standards in developing countries within the context of rapid globalization and a growing food trade.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which developing countries could build national initiatives of compulsory licences.
   Design/methodology/approach - The focus of this article is only on developing countries. The author reflects on the Indian patent jurisprudence regarding the operational relationship between the general principles applicable to working of patented inventions locally and the grant of compulsory licences. The discussion that follows is based on a review of the case: Bayer Corporation versus Natco Pharma with a view to presenting a model for developing countries to maintain that the public interest principle of patent law is well-founded in their domestic patent regimes.
   Findings - The analysis confirms that failure to work locally continues to be abusive of the patent right under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, and remains a valid condition on which to grant a compulsory licence. Thus, this reverses the often-contrary misconception that has become almost a unanimous assumption that failure to work basis for granting compulsory licensing would violate Article 27(1) of TRIPS and its enforcement provisions on patent.
   Originality/value - The author argues that as no member state has challenged the legality of Indian's decision in the World Trade Organisation, under the dispute settlement understanding (DSU) system is more supportive of the contention that failure to work locally continues to be permissible under TRIPS and remains valid conditions on which member states can grant compulsory licences. This further adds weight to the understanding that nothing in the light of TRIPS would, in fact, preclude any possibility of developing countries amending their patent laws accordingly to maintain that the public interest principle underlining patent law is well-founded in their domestic patent regimes.

AB Corporate social responsibility has major implications for pricing decisions in some markets. An extreme case is the pricing of life-saving drugs in developing countries; industry critics have pointed to price as an obstacle to treatment and a factor in the deaths of millions of AIDS victims. This article examines socially responsible pricing in the form of differential pricing across markets, taking into account ability to pay and social welfare. An analysis of AIDS drug pricing between 1999 and 2003 suggests that, in fact, the high prices of AIDS drugs in developing countries sub-optimized contribution earnings in those markets. In the 1990s, multinationals could have earned greater contribution in developing countries by reducing prices, while also saving thousands of lives. However, that could have jeopardized earnings in developed countries, and this, together with other factors, created barriers to socially responsible pricing. Neither multinationals nor developing-country governments can alone create conditions for socially responsible pricing to prevail. This article identifies the role of different players in addressing barriers to socially responsible pricing, including multinationals, governments, non-governmental organizations, and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization. This article also offers lessons for managers in industries with characteristics similar to the drug industry, where socially responsible pricing also may be needed, if not demanded.

AB Globalization of the food system increases the shared risks from food safety, making it a global public good. Globally shared food safety risks include microbial pathogens, pesticide residues, or mycotoxins. Food safety is addressed as a global public good through improved private sector information, institutional innovations such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards Agreement under the World Trade Organization, and trade capacity building to improve food safety in developing country exports. Although meeting standards for high-income consumers motivates trade facilitation, there could be large positive spillovers for developing country consumers from such investments.

TI PUBLIC PROCUREMENT AS AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY TOOL: AN OPTION FOR
   DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
AB This article sets out to answer two interrelated questions: is it advisable for developing countries to use public procurement efforts for development, and should more developing countries join the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA)? We survey key arguments for and against joining the GPA, and argue that government procurement should not be seen only as an indirect support measure for development, but also as a direct vehicle for promoting innovation and industries and, thus, growth and development. We also show that using public procurement for development assumes high levels of policy capacity, which most developing countries lack. In addition, we show how the GPA as well as other WTO agreements make it complicated for the developing countries to benefit from public procurement for innovation. The article suggests that the developing countries could apply a mix of direct and indirect (so-called soft) public-procurement-for-innovation measures. In order to do this, developing countries need to develop the policy capacity to take advantage of the complex and multi-layered industrial policy space still available under WTO rules.

TI Special and differential treatment in the WTO: framing differential
   treatment to achieve (real) development
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose
   Special and differential treatment (SDT) in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has failed to integrate developing countries into the international trading system, as contemplated by the WTO Agreement, itself. This paper aims to interrogate the current application of SDT by WTO members as the possible undermining factor for SDT not delivering on its objective.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research uses a qualitative legal methodology. This study conducts desk analysis of primary legal materials and existing literature to assess current reflections of SDT and draw lessons for reforms in the WTO.
   Findings
   From interrogating current SDT practice in the WTO and a comparative analysis with a similar differential treatment under the Montreal Protocol, this paper finds that indeed, the problem lies in the current approach to SDT application in the WTO. This study finds that the existing absence of eligibility criteria for determining access to SDT by countries is the core reason for the abuse and sub-optimal outcome from its application.
   Originality/value
   While making a case for a rules-based approach to differentiation in the WTO, this paper proposes a unique methodology for differentiating between developing countries for SDT, including the use of a composite indicator to ensure that indicators that are used sufficiently reflect their heterogeneous needs. Drawing inspiration from Gonzalez et al. (2011a), this study introduces an adaptation for selecting a threshold for graduation. Specifically, the proposal on the value of the standard deviation of countries from the weighted mean of the composite indicator as the threshold for graduating countries from SDT is novel.

It details the legislative and administrative measures, as justified by 'scientific evidence' and 'risk assessment', that a WTO member may take to prevent the importation of unsafe food and animal feed, and pests and disease organisms. As well as considering the policy implications and constraints to relevant legislative reform, the article also draws on the author's experience in biosecurity legislative review and drafting in Africa, Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia using the umbrella concept of 'biosecurity' to reflect on the challenges facing drafting of legislation consistent with the normative international frameworks for biosecurity. Taken into account is the impact of the SPS Agreement on the terms of food trade imposed on developing countries and the connection between international trade and environmental protection.

TI Trade liberalization in the Doha development round
SO ECONOMIC POLICY
AB The Doha Round faced a long series of launch-delays and a spectacular launch-failure in Seattle in 1999. While the talks did take off in 2001, the negotiating agenda is still ambiguous in a number of crucial areas. This paper argues that these ambiguities matter greatly. Such ambiguities include the meaning of 'flexibility and exemptions', which are part of the evolving framework for market access negotiations. This may (or may not) be read as allowing developing countries to opt for much smaller concessions than those to be undertaken by the OECD, or even for no concessions. To explore these issues, we examine the impact of multilateral liberalization, developing possible trade liberalization under the Doha Round, starting from a realistic 'baseline' including Chinese WTO Accession and the 2004 EU enlargement. This allows us to focus on effects specifically attributable to trade liberalization under the Doha Round and the potential impact of the Doha Round itself. To this end we employ a global applied general equilibrium model, featuring imperfect competition and variety effects. Scenarios include agriculture, manufactures, and services liberalization, as well as trade facilitation. We conclude that active developing country participation in terms of market access concessions is critical to their prospects. If developing countries continue for the most part with business as usual after the round, in terms of trade policy, there is little scope for actual benefits accruing to developing countries. South-South trade liberalization is key to the 'development' part of the Doha Development Agenda.

SO PACIFIC FOCUS
AB This paper explores the changing status of developing countries under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM). Based on the analysis of WTO dispute dates for the last 14 years, we find that developing countries' participation in the WTO DSM has increased significantly since 2001, which implies their successful adaptation to the new legal system. In spite of concerns regarding various disadvantages on the part of developing countries, such as insufficient legal resources and biased decisions unfavorable to developing countries, the dispute outcome demonstrates that many developing countries have successfully defended their interests as complainants or defendants under the WTO DSM, and that there is no significant bias in the operation of the court that is unfavorable to developing countries. In a broader aspect, this study helps us understand the distributive consequences of the legalized dispute settlement system of the WTO.

TI The role of coalitions at international tariff negotiations: a CGE

SO REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS
AB Developing countries coalitions form an integral part of tariff negotiations that take place under the aegis of the World Trade Organization. While there was only a single coalition in the 70s, their number increased to 31 in the year 2005. Despite the apparent proliferation of coalitions in tariff negotiations, little research on their theoretical and empirical implications has been produced. In particular, we lack an understanding of efficiency and equity effects of coalitions. By exploring this equity-efficiency nexus, the study finds that developing countries coalitions like the G-90 and the Least Developed Countries Group - while benefiting member countries - lead to less efficiency and less equity overall. Forming the Cairns Group, however, leads to a more efficient and equal distribution of the gains from trade.

TI The case for a multilateral agreement on competition policy: A
   developing country perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Although the issue of trade and competition policy has been dropped from the Work Programmes of the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, it continues to be discussed in other fora and may return to the WTO after the completion of the Round. This article assesses the case for an agreement from the perspective of developing countries. It begins by reviewing the 'development dimension' of the WTO debate and then examines three specific antitrust issues that were of considerable relevance to developing countries but were not pursued: export cartels, antidumping and intellectual property rights (IPRs). There follows a critical assessment of the empirical and theoretical arguments for the kind of agreement that was being advocated to deal with international cartels. Alternative proposals, involving developing countries 'outsourcing' antitrust enforcement to developed countries, are also sceptically examined, as is the relevance for developing countries of the kind of competition policy that is currently in place in developed countries. Finally, a general approach to international trade agreements suggests that developing countries had nothing to gain from the proposal that was on the table, and the article concludes by proposing a range of more suitable alternatives.

TI Trade openness and structural vulnerability in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how trade openness affects the structural vulnerability of developing countries. The analysis is conducted on both the entire sample of 105 countries as well as two sub-samples, namely least developed countries (LDCs) and non-LDCs.
   Design/methodology/approach - To perform the analysis, the author employs fixed-effects (within) regressions supplemented by instrumental variables technique based on the two-step generalized methods of moments approach.
   Findings - The author finds empirical evidence that although trade policy liberalization reduces the structural vulnerability on the entire sample developing countries, no statistically significant effect of such liberalization is obtained either on LDCs or non-LDCs. However, trade policy liberalization appears to reduce countries' exposure to shocks, result that applies to the entire sample as well as the two sub-samples. The author also observes that trade policy liberalization exerts no (statistically) significant effect on the size of shocks that affect developing countries, result that applies to both the full sample and the sub-samples of LDCs and non-LDCs.
   Research limitations/implications - In the absence of a well-established theoretical framework on how trade openness affects the structural vulnerability of developing, the author adopts a pragmatic approach by drawing upon many insights of Loayza and Raddatz (2007) who study the structural determinants of external vulnerability.
   Practical implications - Developing countries in general and LDCs in particular could address their structural weaknesses by making optimal use of their trade policies. In particular, they could better use the flexibilities available to them in provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO)' Agreements. In this respect, the international community, notably donors of the developed world has a key role to play.
   Originality/value - This is the first study exploring how trade openness, capturing here through trade policy liberalization affects the structural vulnerability of developing countries.

TI ACHIEVING WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION COMPLIANCE FOR EXPORT PROCESSING
   ZONES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS FOR DEVELOPING
   COUNTRIES
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB Export processing zones (EPZs) are statutorily created investment parks that developing countries establish to attract foreign investment in exchange for government-granted fiscal incentives. At their core, EPZs are a quid pro quo between host governments and investor companies: in exchange for the promise of job creation, technological transfer, economic development, and compliance with export performance requirements, investor companies receive substantial fiscal incentives, such as tax and tariff exemptions.
   Most EPZ statutes are inconsistent with Article 3.1(a) of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) because EPZ incentives qualify as prohibited export subsidies. Fortunately, many developing countries have received exemptions from this prohibition to maintain their EPZ systems. The exemptions, however, are set to permanently expire for many countries on December 31, 2015, spurring the need for EPZ reform.
   This Note proposes a framework for achieving WTO-compliance for EPZ statutes by conditioning EPZ incentives on an investor company's implementation of standards of corporate social responsibility. This proposal will permit developing countries to maintain fiscal incentives-thus helping preserve their economic competitiveness as attractive destinations for foreign investment while also offsetting potential harm that the mandatory elimination of EPZ export requirements may cause to developing-country industries.

TI Developing Countries in the 21st Century WTO: New Contours of India's
   Global Engagement
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB As an institution, the WTO (with 153 members) has functioned very differently from the GATT. The old power centers within the multilateral trade regime have been joined by new power centers, especially the emerging economies. Developing and the least-developed members, acting in coalitions, have become more effective players in the Doha Round with significant success in ensuring that WTO agreements are in their favour. However, they have not had similar success in setting the negotiating agendas that meet their expectations and development concerns.
   This paper examines the changing contours of the engagement of developing countries, with special reference to India, in the 21st century WTO system of trade governance. It argues that emerging developing countries today need to pick up the leadership mantle with determination and play a constructive role in furthering the cause for sustained trade integration. This will be in the larger interest of protecting their international market access as well as much needed domestic reforms. The paper tries to identify the role and responsibilities of emerging powers like India in the steering and governance of the post-Doha WTO.

An implication of the paradigm shift is that there should be a concomitant expansion of the policy agendas of the international climate and trade regimes. The traditional North-South paradigm of technology transfer ignores the increasing importance of developing countries as sources of advanced climate-friendly technologies, and therefore ignores South-North and South-South transfers. Further, whereas the North-South paradigm has emphasized developing countries' intellectual property rights policies as barriers to technology transfers, the 'global' paradigm focuses attention on trade and investment policy barriers, including developed countries' policies that inhibit technology transfer from developing countries. The analysis is relevant to international negotiations in the post-2012 climate regime, and is also relevant to the future development of the trade regime - not only at the multilateral level in the WTO, but also at the regional and bilateral levels.

TI Legal Capacity and Developing Country Performance in the Panel Stage of
   the WTO Dispute Settlement System
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Existing literature has yielded some evidence suggesting that developing countries are less likely to file World Trade Organization (WTO) trade disputes or to secure concessions in the consultation stage instead of the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. Furthermore, this 'bias' in the use of the dispute settlement mechanism against developing countries has often been attributed to developing countries' lack of legal capacity, or the financial, human and institutional resources available to analyse, pursue or litigate a dispute. However, much of this literature focuses on the constraining effect of legal capacity in the pre-panel ruling stage of the process. This article extends previous research and uses various alternative measures of legal capacity to more systematically analyse the effect of legal capacity on developing countries' performance during the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. Empirical analysis of WTO disputes filed by developing countries that have ended with a panel ruling between 1980 and 2010 shows that developing countries with greater government efficiency and regulatory quality are more likely to obtain positive panel rulings, although there is little evidence suggesting that legal capacity as measured by the size of a country's delegation in Geneva or its past experience in initiating WTO disputes may enhance its prospect of successfully defending its legal claims in the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. This result reinforces prior findings about the disadvantages developing countries face in the dispute settlement system and underscores the need for developing countries to engage in domestic capacity building in order to enhance their chances of successfully litigating at the WTO.

TI Are Trade and Forests Survival Compatible?
SO FUTURE OF THE WORLDS FORESTS: IDEAS VS IDEOLOGIES
SE World Forests
AB This chapter examines the question of whether trade in forest products from developing countries adds or subtracts value from the standing forests in those countries, and what potential the trade instrument may have in promoting sustainable forest management in developing countries. It is important to bear in mind that only a few tropical countries export a significant proportion of their output, and that in general demand for forest products within developing and transitional economies has been growing rapidly. It is also the case that plantations are rapidly substituting for natural forest outputs in developing countries, not only for commodity grade material, but increasingly for higher quality raw material as well.
   Forest products trade issues have come before the World Trade Organization (WTO) and international consultations in the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) and the International Tropical Timber Organization. Voluntary certification of timber for compliance with sustainable forest management guidelines has grown quickly in the recent two decades, but has to date not produced significant price incentives for certified product from developing countries, nor major impact on deforestation. Illegal logging remains a major impediment to sustainable forest management in general in developing countries: the trade instrument will have some role in addressing this, but much more will be required for success.

Dealing specifically with the WTO, a study is made of the impacts that the trade policies from the Uruguay Round have produced in LADC, and considerations are presented concerning the position of these countries in future WTO negotiations. It is concluded that in the current framework of globalization, the WTO should play an active role in income redistribution at world level.

TI Determining a Science-based Food Safety Objective/Appropriate Level of
   Protection for Application in Developing Countries
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB When determining the Appropriate Level of Protection (ALOP) in food safety law, developed countries rely on the Food Safety Objective (FSO) to meet the requirements of World Trade Organization (WTO) law and to provide a high level of protection based on insights from food safety science. Implementing an FSO/ALOP is resource-intensive and costly. Developing countries who would like to provide similar levels of protection are restricted by limited resources and often face difficulties implementing such an FSO-based ALOP. As a consequence, developing countries may base their ALOP on other legally acceptable reasons, which are non-scientific and less effective. We illustrate a less resource-intensive way to implement the FSO in the ALOP, which enables developing countries to design an ALOP that is based on food safety science. Depending on the resources available in the respective country, we map different possibilities to determine a science-based FSO/ALOP concept for developing countries, which also takes into account the requirements of WTO law.

TI WTO Rules and Agricultural Development Cooperation between Developed and
   Developing Countries
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB For many developed countries with confined land resources and high costs of labour, agricultural farming in foreign territories provides attractive business opportunities. Such investment projects will also be welcomed by many hosting developing countries given the substantial effect of economic development and employment. In this sense, agricultural development cooperation at an international level could contribute to the solution of the North-South problem. Notwithstanding this necessity and potential contribution, it is doubtful whether the current WTO legal system can fully support this type of cooperation. Various governmental supports involving the cooperation projects could be determined as prohibited or actionable subsidies as well as discriminatory measures. WTO provisions regarding the special and differential treatment for the developing economies are of no help. This paper identifies legal problems involving agricultural development cooperation between developed and developing countries and explores ways to interpret relevant WTO rules and to amend them in order to solve the problems.

TI Interconnection regulation in India: Lessons for developing countries
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
AB Interconnection is not only a major competition issue per se, it is also a critical element of the basic telecommunications agreement of the WTO. An important issue in interconnection regulation is interconnection charging especially in the context of a dominant incumbent. Most regulators in developing countries face challenges in setting interconnection prices in the absence of market information on the incumbent's or entrant's costs, competition or demand and models suited for developing countries that also adhere to the WTO guidelines. There are few papers that illustrate the challenges faced by regulators in such a context. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by highlighting the nature of interaction between the regulator, incumbent, judiciary and the political environment, the role of formal models in setting interconnection charges and the implications of rapid technological changes in a developing country context through a case study of India.
   The case study highlights the point that besides independence, it is important to vest enforcement powers in the regulatory agency for it to be credible. Incorporating the WTO interconnection guidelines within a developing country context has implications for network growth and poses challenges to the regulatory processes.
   Although Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) started with a distortionary, inefficiently priced network providing low coverage and quality, it has meandered its way to a more reasonable network access pricing regime. The decreasing cost of technology and increasing incomes in India and political interventions in regulation have put pressure on TRAI to provide lower interconnection charges and faster telecom growth. Thus, it is pragmatic for regulators to start with a "quick and dirty" estimate, provided that they can signal the downward trend in interconnection pricing, rather than wait for the "correct" estimates.
   Adoption of future looking strategies (interconnection exchanges), use of a variety of formal models, and strengthening of regulatory capacity are all necessary steps in fostering a competitive environment. Interconnection regimes set up early in the reform process require a review. For successful competition, effective dispute resolution mechanisms and institutions are also important.

TI Africa and the WTO doha round: An overview
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB Developing countries, and especially Least Developed Countries, were promised a WTO 'Development Round' at Doha in 2001. In fact, the Round's agenda became dominated by topics and proposals of little relevance and at times threatening for some groups of developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, African engagement in the Round has been generally low and defensively articulated, though some fringe gains have been achieved. If and when the Round is revived, these could be complemented by a more aggressive stance on preferences. This, in turn, will need to be backed by greater exploitation of the heightened role of moral argument in international political and economic discourse.

SO GAZI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Liberalization of services brought a competitive environment where governments on the one hand try to get access to the markets of the most competitive sectors for them, and on the other hand they try to protect their local suppliers against sector's global giants. Although several developing countries have participated in the globalization of services, still some developing countries show resistance to process of liberalization in services, as they do not see themselves as possessing much of comparative advantage in the production and exchange of services. In recent years, publication of statistical data on services trade, has allowed researchers make international comparisons in macro level. In this study, Turkey's position in global services trade environment is explored in the case of transport sector. The place of Turkey among 148 member countries of World Trade Organization is evaluated by cluster analysis with respect to transportation services trade indicators.
   The results show that current position of Turkey in global services trade market is far from being competitive. The recruitments necessary for Turkey to gain its competitiveness are proved by a scenario analysis.

TI A lifeline to treatment: the role of Indian generic manufacturers in
   supplying antiretroviral medicines to developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY
AB Background: Indian manufacturers of generic antiretroviral (ARV) medicines facilitated the rapid scale up of HIV/AIDS treatment in developing countries though provision of low-priced, quality-assured medicines. The legal framework in India that facilitated such production, however, is changing with implementation of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and intellectual property measures being discussed in regional and bilateral free trade agreement negotiations. Reliable quantitative estimates of the Indian role in generic global ARV supply are needed to understand potential impacts of such measures on HIV/AIDS treatment in developing countries.
   Methods: We utilized transactional data containing 17,646 donor-funded purchases of ARV tablets made by 115 low-and middle-income countries from 2003 to 2008 to measure market share, purchase trends and prices of Indian-produced generic ARVs compared with those of non-Indian generic and brand ARVs.
   Results: Indian generic manufacturers dominate the ARV market, accounting for more than 80% of annual purchase volumes. Among paediatric ARV and adult nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor markets, Indian-produced generics accounted for 91% and 89% of 2008 global purchase volumes, respectively. From 2003 to 2008, the number of Indian generic manufactures supplying ARVs increased from four to 10 while the number of Indian-manufactured generic products increased from 14 to 53. Ninety-six of 100 countries purchased Indian generic ARVs in 2008, including high HIV-burden sub-Saharan African countries. Indian-produced generic ARVs used in first-line regimens were consistently and considerably less expensive than non-Indian generic and innovator ARVs. Key ARVs newly recommended by the World Health Organization are three to four times more expensive than older regimens.
   Conclusions: Indian generic producers supply the majority of ARVs in developing countries. Future scale up using newly recommended ARVs will likely be hampered until Indian generic producers can provide the dramatic price reductions and improved formulations observed in the past. Rather than agreeing to inappropriate intellectual property obligations through free trade agreements, India and its trade partners - plus international organizations, donors, civil society and pharmaceutical manufacturers - should ensure that there is sufficient policy space for Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers to continue their central role in supplying developing countries with low-priced, quality-assured generic medicines.

AB FAO/WHO encourages member countries to develop national food control measures based on risk assessment in order to assure proper protection level to consumers and facilitate fair trade. This is particularly important for developing countries as WTO members because it is clearly stated in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement that: (a) SPS measures should be based on risk assessment techniques developed by relevant international organizations; and (b) Codex standards which is based on risk assessment are regarded as the international norm in trade dispute settlement. When conducting risk assessment on food chemicals (including additives and contaminants) in developing countries, in most cases it is not necessary to conduct their own hazard characterization because the ADIs or PTWIs of food chemicals developed by international expert groups (e.g. JECFA) are universally applicable and also developing countries do not have the resources to repeat those expensive toxicological studies. On the other hand, it is necessary to conduct exposure assessment in developing countries because exposure to food chemicals varies from country to country. This is not only crucial in setting national standards, but also very important for developing countries to participate in the process of developing Codex standards. In addition to food standard development, risk assessment is also useful in setting up priorities in imported food inspection and evaluating the success of various food safety control measures.

TI Mineral Export Restraints and Sustainable Development-Are Rare Earths
   Testing the WTO's Loopholes?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB China's actions in limiting the export of rare earths have drawn the world's attention. The USA, Japan, and the European Union (EU) have been frustrated with China's measures, even threatening to bring the case to the WTO. These rare earth trade disputes are but the tip of the iceberg. Forms of export restraints on minerals have been increasingly practiced by developing countries, reflecting developing countries' determination to upgrade their own economic condition against a broader backdrop of international economic transition in a mineral-hungry world. Such issues of mineral export restraints are deeply rooted in the traditional international trade structure, and in turn serve as a historic move to break it. The WTO's consensus-based approach, with developing countries comprising more than two-thirds of WTO membership, has to accommodate this changing situation in both its judicial and negotiation scenarios. Accused of being trade-distorting and inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on the part of mineral export restraints, developing countries expect to defend themselves by reasons of environmental protection and conservation of exhaustible natural resources. This article anticipates that, in the next round of multilateral negotiation, the developed world will attempt to bring the issue of export restraints under multilateral mandates.

AB Purpose - World Trade Organization (WTO) accession marked a new beginning for China's economic, legal and institutional reforms and rapid integration with the rest of the world. The purpose of this paper is to review China's post-WTO transition experience, synthesize and update studies on China's pattern of trade and structural transformation, and provide both positive and negative lessons for other developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper has broadly reviewed the latest policy changes after China's WTO accession, and literatures on China's trade and economic development issues in order to understand the Chinese success and its speciality, and draw some useful lessons for both China's decision-makers and other developing countries.
   Findings- There are two main findings: first, market liberalization alone is not sufficient, and economic system reform and the liberalization are closely related and complement and promote each other. Second, experimentations via special economic zones (SEZs) and opening to foreign direct investment (FDI), which facilitated and supported cluster development and learning-by-doing, are needed for industrial upgrading and export competitiveness.
   Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the wisdom of China's simultaneous pursuit of domestic economic system reform, and opening to the international market. However, China has also paid a high social and environmental cost for its rapid growth. It is important for developing countries to have an exclusive, balanced and sustainable strategy in the future development.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The study aims to focus on the effectiveness of international investment agreements (IIAs) in helping or facilitating the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) to host developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach To critically examine the topic, the black letter approach and the socio-legal analysis are adopted. The study has analysed how Mauritius, being a developing country, is responding to FDI needs from various bilateral and multilateral investment treaties concluded, and the research includes the analysis of official data publicly made available by the World Trade Organization, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Monetary Fund and Mauritius governmental agencies' reports.
   Findings From the methodologies used, it was found that other than IIAs, there are various key determinants which foreign investors consider prior to injecting their capital in developing countries in terms of environmental, social and cultural factors. Also, there are some inherent loopholes mostly in terms of monitoring, in the way IIAs are concluded and are applied in practice by and amongst signatory states.
   Originality/value This research is amongst the first studies to conclude the link between IIAs and FDI flows in developing countries with a particular focus on Mauritius. Additionally, an overwhelming number of studies have emphasised on the efforts to boost FDI, which are inspired mostly by action plans of developed nations, but this research will analyse the policy options adopted by China, being itself a developing country, and the extent to which such recommendations are applicable in the context of Mauritius will also be considered.

SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB The Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) has been an integral part of the GATT/WTO since 1989 and shoulders a fundamental responsibility in making the regime more transparent. This paper asks: how has the TPRM responded to demands from developing countries for information and transparency ? The paper uses a typology of information systems to explain the evolution of surveillance in the trade regime and asks whether the TPRM was assigned the functions of an ideal-type information system. The paper, then, evaluates the performance of the TPRM against its given mandate of increasing transparency to promote improved adherence with trade rules. It presents, for the first time, empirical evidence on the content of reports and the participation of countries, to highlight persisting content- and participation-related challenges. It discusses the capacity challenges within the WTO Secretariat and briefly outlines efforts made by developing countries to boost surveillance capacity at home. The paper ends by outlining priorities for monitoring in the trade regime: generating specific information that developing countries need, supporting domestic capacity for surveillance (including from non-official sources), and concentrating on improved peer review and follow-up procedures.

SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB The global significance of intellectual property laws is familiar to most of those interested in this area of law. What might be less familiar is the impact of intellectual property on the issue of food security in developing countries. This paper considers the consequences of factors such as TRIPS-plus compliance imposed on recent entrants to the World Trade Organization and the role and impact of patents and sui generis means of protecting plant breeders' rights on food security in developing countries. In particular the paper focuses on examples drawn from the Pacific where island countries are not only considering WTO membership or have recently signed up to this and incurred consequent IP obligations, but where food security is increasingly under pressure due to climate change, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, shifts in agricultural practice and knowledge transfer, changing socioeconomic patterns and the consequences of the global economic crisis. This is also a region where Western models of IP, although prevalent as introduced and imposed concepts, being a legacy of a colonial past, fit uneasily with forms and practices of indigenous traditional knowledge, and where local initiatives may be better suited to ensuring sustainability of food crops than the present thrust of neo-colonial IP laws.

AB This paper addresses the issue of food security in developing countries and how agriculture plays an important role in achieving not only food security, but also in reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The promotion of trade liberalization by the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) has undermined the productive capacity of developing countries and their comparative advantage in the agricultural sector, marginalizing small-scale farmers and benefitting the big corporations. The paper looks at the issue of intellectual property rights that big corporations have for seeds and their effects on small-scale farmers, and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) is insufficient to regulate the dominance of big corporations in the food and agricultural market. The paper is divided into seven sections: trade liberalization and food security, the WTO and the AoA, the effects of the AoA on developing countries, the role of transnational corporations (TNCs) on food security, CSR and TNCs, policy recommendations, and conclusions.

TI Doing "development" at the World Trade Organization: The Doha round and
   special and differential treatment
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The term "special and differential treatment" covers provisions scattered around the Uruguay Round Agreements; some of these are mandatory, but many others are not. Utilisation of SDT has been patchy, but this may be because of deficiencies in provision, rather than an absence of need. Doha promised an 'early harvest' of strengthening to existing SDT provisions, but there has been virtually no progress, as a series of deadlines have come and gone. Two key divisions are over the timing and location of negotiations and their coverage. Developing countries wanted early agreement to 'redress existing deficiencies' at a plenary level; industrialised countries have sought to delay significant change and shift it to the other Doha negotiating groups as a bargaining chip. Industrialised countries object to providing significant SDT to all developing countries (given that some are major trade actors), but the developing country group sees no purpose in discussing differentiation and graduation until there are proposals of substance on the table. These cleavages look set to continue. The danger is that developing countries will have to choose between bland statements or significant provisions, the "price" of which is substantial concessions elsewhere.

AB This article investigates the impact of multilateral trade liberalization on poverty in developing countries from a macroeconomic perspective. The empirical analysis suggests that multilateral trade liberalization is conducive to poverty reduction in developing countries. This outcome therefore suggests that greater multilateral cooperation on trade matters among countries, in particular the Members of the World Trade Organization, would allow further trade liberalization at the multilateral level to the benefit of poor people in developing countries.

TI Patents on Pharmaceutical Products in Fair International Economic
   Relations
SO PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Intellectual property right (IPR) negotiations during the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations were characterized by significant disagreement between developed and developing countries. For developing countries, the WTO system might have gone too far on patents. It is particularly true for essential medicines critical to human life and health. The Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the WTO includes a few provisions on special and differential treatment (SDT) of developing countries. However, these do not specifically mention pharmaceutical products. Patentability of pharmaceutical products may be analysed in light of fairness. From the viewpoint of distributional fairness, this article derives several policy suggestions for pharmaceutical products in fair international economic relations.

TI Promise or pitfall? The limited gains from agricultural trade
   liberalisation for developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB It has become an article of faith in international trade negotiations that farmers in developing countries have much to gain from agricultural trade liberalisation. This paper assesses the evidence for such claims, relying on World Bank data and analyses, United Nations trade data, and other economic modelling carried out to inform the current round of World Trade Organisation negotiations. It concludes that the promise of agricultural trade liberalisation is overstated, while the costs to small-scale farmers in developing countries are often very high.

TI SUSPENDING TRIPS OBLIGATIONS AS A VIABLE OPTION FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
   TO ENFORCE WTO RULINGS
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB It has been perceived that the World Trade Organization (hereinafter "WTO") dispute settlement system has a fundamental disadvantage for developing country members in enforcing WTO decisions against developed country members. Developing country members assert that, albeit equally available to all members, the limited size of their markets make the full use of the remedy of last resort, retaliation, hardly possible for them. In particular, within a small domestic market, they are unable to exert sufficient economic pressure against developed country members to induce compliance. Rather, retaliation may be more detrimental to them than the non-complying developed members. As an alternative to traditional tariff retaliation, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of suspending intellectual property rights protected under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter "TRIPS") and provides some proposals of expanding its use, which would generate greater leverage for the developing country members to enforce WTO rulings against developed country members.

TI Could Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Other Developing Countries
   Which Have Not Been Able to Establish Legal Framework for the
   Application of Trade Remedy Measures Make a Beginning by Establishing
   Mechanism for the Application of Safeguard Measures Only?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The rule based multilateral trading system created by World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes that in pursuing liberal and open trade policies, countries may have to use trade remedy measures such as anti-dumping countervailing or safeguard measures in cases where their domestic agricultural producers or manufacturing industries are hurt or injured by imports.
   However, such trade remedy measures can be applied only after investigations undertaken in accordance with the detailed rules laid down by the Agreements on Anti-dumping Practices (ADP), Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and on Safeguards, it is established that increased imports are causing injury to the domestic agricultural producers or industry. As a result, over sixty developing countries, most 4 which are least developed or countries at lower stages of development, which have not been able to establish such framework because of financial and other constraints are not able to make effective use of the rights which these Agreements provide.
   The paper suggests that in the situation, the least developed and other developing countries which have not been able to establish legal and institutional framework for applying all of the three trade remedy measures, should be permitted to apply only safeguard measures, which from the administrative point of view would require only modest staff, by adopting an Understanding.
   It is also in this context important to note that after the conclusion of the Doha Round, all developing countries would be able to apply to agricultural products, special safeguard measures if the price of imports falls below specified price trigger or their volume exceeds specified trigger, irrespective of whether the imported goods which are causing injury are being dumped or being subsidized. The need to apply safeguard measures in accordance with the provision 4 the Understanding clarifying the rules of the Safeguard Agreement would arise only in a few cases of manufactured products where domestic industries complain that the increased imports are causing serious injury to them.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
CT 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC)
CY DEC 10-13, 2017
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
SP WTO
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces a watershed. Developed country Members want to abandon the Doha round and negotiate 'new issues', notably electronic commerce, as part of a broader US-led strategy to rewrite the global trade rules for the 21st century. Developing countries insist the Doha round be concluded before considering new issues and most reject the e-commerce agenda as foreclosing their options for digital development. This standoff dominated the MC11. The new e-commerce agenda has its genesis in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Three factors complicate moves to export it to the WTO. First, those rules are blunt instruments designed to protect the first mover status and oligopolistic power of Big Tech. Second, they lack any development flexibilities or obligations. Third, their application to major developing country competitors and the potentially lucrative markets of larger developing countries requires multilateralization through the WTO, but that will be a highly contested process. That contest is now playing out through the plurilateral process announced by the e-commerce proponents during the MC11. The proposals assume a major expansion of Members' commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Favourable interpretations of sectoral classifications, modes of trading services, and the application of technological neutrality to historical commitments would override the original GATS acquis that ensures developing countries can control their exposure, and seriously diminish their regulatory autonomy to maximize the opportunities of the digital economy and minimize the risks. Such an agenda could deepen the crisis at the WTO.

TI Are the competition rules in the WTO trips agreement adequate?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In connection with the run-up to the Cancun Ministerial Conference, the author was asked whether there are grounds for recommending amendment of WTO TRIPS Agreement rules addressing competition. The general conclusion of the study is that the TRIPS Agreement in its present form provides substantial discretion to WTO Members in the formulation and application of competition rules regulating intellectual property, and this arrangement serves the best interests of developed and developing countries. Potential amendments were considered across a matrix of interested country groups: North-North, North-South, South-North and South-South. Although country groups with different interests might seek to modify TRIPS competition-related rules to their perceived advantage, there is little reason to believe that consensus would be reached on such changes. The study acknowledges that global welfare benefits might flow from a more highly integrated international competition regime with powers to investigate and enforce agreed upon rules. There is, however, little identifiable near-term impetus for building such a regime, whether at the WTO or elsewhere. Competition laws of certain developed countries expressly exempt conduct with wholly foreign effects from the application of rules regulating anticompetitive practices, including those concerning intellectual property. Such exemptions appear inconsistent with advocacy of liberal market principles, and they are damaging to developing country interests. As part of the Doha Development Round commitment to developing countries, a decision by developed countries to eliminate these exemptions would be constructive.

TI Impact of WTO on Growth and Development of International Tourism
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB The multilateral framework under World Trade Organization (WTO) aims to promote trade in goods and services across borders. International tourism falls under General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that provides a framework for international trade in services. Cross-border movement of consumers i.e. tourists forms a typical characteristic of international tourism as a service. Over the years, the tourism destinations as well as tourists by way of their origin have witnessed a gradual but steady shift from developed to developing countries as delineated in the paper. Tourism has become the propulsion for economic development in a number of developing countries contributing significantly to employment, foreign exchange earnings and economic growth. Since then, tourism has the greatest number of GATS commitments; progressive liberalization of tourism under GATS has enormous impacts on growth and development of other sectors. This paper makes an in-depth analysis of patterns of international tourism especially with reference to WTO agreements. It critically evaluates GATS and its impact on patterns of international tourism. At the end, an attempt is made to suggest a strategic framework to promote international tourism with special focus on developing countries. The data collection points applied in the paper comprise of United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the WTO secretariat.

TI Soft or tough guys in Kyoto ? Free-rider incentives and the Samaritan's
   Dilemma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENERGY ISSUES
AB One crucial precondition for the overall achievement of the Kyoto Protocol by 2010 is the participation of the USA. According to political economy theory, big countries have the strongest incentives to provide global collective good provisions. Reality, however, does not seem to follow this logic, as the USA dropped out in The Hague (2000). One main argument for the USA to drop out was the risk of carbon leakage, i.e. the fact that investments would shift to big developing countries such as China and India. We apply the approaches of collective action theory by Olson (1965) and the Samaritan's Dilemma game by Buchanan (1975) to this problem. The policy recommendation on how to make the USA rejoin the agreement is that other countries should support the USA in its 'tough' policy towards big developing countries, i.e. to define preselected rules for participation and delegate the decision-making power to a neutral international institution such as the World Trade Organization. This initiative may both induce big developing countries to join the Kyoto Protocol and may also ensure that the USA will rejoin and that all Annex B countries will reach their stated target levels.

TI TRIPS waiver of COVID-19 vaccines: Impact on pharmaceutical industry and
   what it means to developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB The WTO was formed in 1995 and since then countries have abide by Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The agreement provides for comprehensive plan for patenting and protection including those of medical supply units including vaccines and diagnosis. Recently developing countries such as India and South Africa have demanded TRIPS waiver for access to vaccines for all the developing countries The TRIPS waiver demanded, would apply to vaccines, diagnosis, and treatment related to COVID-19. The waiver is important as it would allow member state in researching, manufacturing, and supplying of vaccines. The proposal by the developing countries for temporary waiver of IP rights argues that IP could impede the supply of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. However, there is no near consensus as most of the developed countries opposed this stance and they even argue that waiving TRIPS is not going to ramp up the manufacturing process. The pharmaceutical industry is also against this stance of developing countries, they put their argument forward that waiving of the IP will inhibit research and development of future prospects.

TI Effect of multilateral trade liberalization on export performance in
   developing countries Does aid for trade matter?
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine empirically whether the impact of multilateral trade liberalization on export performance and export performance convergence in developing countries depends on the amount of Aid for Trade (AfT) flows that accrue to these countries. Export performance is measured by export of goods and services to gross domestic product ratio, whereas export performance convergence refers to the process whereby a developing country's export performance catches up with the world's average export performance. Design/methodology/approach The analysis has used an unbalanced panel data set covering a sample of 97 developing countries, over the period 2002 to 2015. The two-step system generalized methods of moments has been used to address the question empirically. Findings Empirical results show that multilateral trade liberalization generates higher export performance and convergence in export performance in developing countries only when it is accompanied by higher AfT flows to developing countries, with a view of helping these countries enhance their trade capacity and reap the opportunities offered by multilateral trade liberalization in the international trade market.
   Originality/value Many papers related to the AfT effectiveness have looked at the effect of AfT inflows on recipient-countries' export performance. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of multilateral trade liberalization on developing countries' export performance and export performance convergence and particularly to whether this effect would depend on the amounts of AfT that would accrue to developing countries to help them develop their trade capacity. To the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has addressed this issue.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This article examines the literature on trade liberalization and economic development. It also briefly looks at the theory of comparative advantage which is seen as justification for global trade liberalization under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. The study is important because once again the international institutions strongly advocate trade liberalization in the developing countries. Such policies may increase vulnerability and make the developing countries further hostages to international finance capital. It seems that trade liberalization is being presented as a suitable developmental strategy for developing countries despite weak empirical findings. It appears that with the current agenda of universal trade liberalization, not only will development space shrink but also self-determination and economic sovereignty will be undermined.

This article explores how freer international trade will affect developing countries that are net importers of health care goods and services. Four commodities are used as special cases for discussion: pharmaceuticals, health care technologies, pesticides, and tobacco and its related products. The authors discuss the role of international specialized agencies, such as the World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, and World Bank, that are concerned with international trade and its health and health care consequences, and argue that closer collaboration is required among these agencies if the negative effects of trade liberalization on developing countries are to be mitigated. The authors pose a number of research questions that could help in developing proactive policies for the South on the trade of goods and services with harmful effects on health as well as those with potential health and economic benefits.

AB International agreements and institutions affect innovation in developing countries. We analyze the impact of advanced country multinational enterprises (AMNEs) and supranational organizations on the regulatory adoption of global intellectual property protection standards. In particular, we investigate 60 developing countries that signed the Trade-relate Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement of the World Trade Organization in 1994. Our empirical findings show that a greater involvement of AMNEs in the domestic innovation systems of developing countries results in more stringent TRIPS adoption and convergence to advanced country IP protection standards. This relationship is positively moderated by country dependency on supranational organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. This analysis contributes to the literature on institutional change and institutional voids. It provides insights into the influence of external actors on the underlying change processes.

Important forces include increased funding initiatives supporting immunization at the global level; regulatory harmonization; widespread intellectual property rights provisions through the World Trade Organization agreements; the emergence of developing-country manufacturers as major players in vaccine supply; and the appearance of new communicable disease threats, including those potentially linked to bioterrorism. All of these forces can affect, either positively and negatively, the development and availability of vaccines. Harnessing these will be a challenge for policyrnakers and immunization stakeholders.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to highlight the lack of fairness in the international trading system, including the HR policies in the WTO which have wider implications on the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The main research methodology undertaken for this paper is based on the quantitative approach, predominantly from sources such as books, articles and WTO reports.
   Findings - There is a correlation between the HR policies employed by the WTO and the usage by developing countries of the WTO DSU.
   Practical implications - The implications of the research/paper indicate that discrimination against developing countries in the international system goes beyond their inherent weakness as poorer members of the international order. Such discrimination is deep rooted within the institutional governance of the system.
   Social implications - The need to re-evaluate policies practices by international institutions in the light of the developments of the twenty-first century.
   Originality/value - There has been no work undertaken in relation to the use of language as a criterion for job selection and its implications on the participatory value of developing countries in the WTO DSU.

TI Technology Transfer at the WTO: Old Promises and New Hopes of the
   Developing World
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB While the subject of forced technology transfer has elicited sharp focus in recent years, similar attention has not been directed to the issue of voluntary technology transfer under the aegis of the WTO. Technology transfer was seen as a tool to enable development by both developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement entrenched technology transfer to LDCs as a hard obligation for developed countries, but its imperfect implementation has caused concerns to LDCs. Developing countries, such as India, are not beneficiaries under Article 66.2, but they have pushed for a closer link between technology transfer and development issues through a variety of ways at the WTO. Due to COVID-19, the issue of technology transfer concerning health in the LDCs becomes more important. Against this background, this article analyses the experience of LDCs with the implementation of Article 66.2 and India's experience in its push for further entrenchment of technology transfer obligations. This article specifically assess technology transfer by the US and the EU in light of COVID-19 vis-a-vis Article 66.2. The paper pays particular attention to the various roadblocks in the implementation of Article 66.2 and the solutions as proposed by LDCs themselves.

SO LEGAL ISSUES OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB What kind of technical assistance (TA) and capacity-building benefits do developing countries enjoy if they sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with developed countries? This is the most frequently asked question on FTA policymaking raised by developing country officials at various occasions discussing trade policies. While we tend to normatively insist that an FTA should lead to a win-win situation for all contracting parties and that developed members should provide TA to developing partners so that the latter can maximize the benfits and minimize the costs of an FTA, empirical assessments of TA mechanisms under FTAs have not been conducted thoroughly. By conducting a detailed textual analysis of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and various FTAs, this article identifies how much more TA can be enjoyed by developing members if they sign FTAs, especially those with developed countries.

SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Several factors potentially responsible for the failure to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations are analyzed. A two-stage negotiation and ratification game between the "North" (industrialized countries) and the "South" (developing countries) is employed and collapses into a single diagram. The choice of negotiating agenda, principles, and currency of the Doha Round interact with domestic political factors in leading WTO members, the fast growth of exports prior to 2007, and pervasive unilateral trade reform to eliminate the "landing zone" for this particular multilateral negotiation. Recent emphasis on differences between developing countries and on Chinese WTO accession as independent causes of the impasse seems misplaced.

TI The TRIPS Patent Protection Provisions and Their Effects on Transferring
   Climate Change Technologies to LDCs and Poor Developing Countries: A
   Critical Appraisal
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Despite the existence of almost eighty international agreements and legal instruments, there has not been a marked development in the transfer of climate change technologies to poor and the least developing countries. This article investigates the role of intellectual property rights (IPDs) and scrutinizes the effects of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on the transfer of these technologies. It explores the TRIPS patent protection provisions and examines the associated flexibilities like compulsory licensing and parallel import options in the context of the transfer of climate change technologies. It finally concludes that the TRIPS patent protection rules, including the existing flexibilities, are one of the biggest impediments to the transfer of these technologies to poor and least developed countries. New agreements or promises on the transfer of green technologies would be fruitless if these TRIPS rules are not amended.

TI Pharmaceutical patent expropriation and technology strategy: strategic

SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB Developing country governments in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia, have legislated the controversial business practices of compulsory licensing and parallel importing of HIV/AIDS drug therapies - allowing for the domestic manufacture or foreign importing of HIV/AIDS generic drug therapies without the consent of the patent holding pharmaceutical industry companies. This article provides a descriptive overview of the economic structure of the global pharmaceutical industry and reviews exceptions (compulsory licensing/parallel importing) to the World Trade Organization's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property RightsAgreement on intellectual property rights protection. The article also explains the generic technology strategy of the global pharmaceutical industry, with special emphasis placed on the proprietary sector of the pharmaceutical industry. The author offers an analysis of alternative strategic options, including (1) foregoing patenting in developing countries; (2) companies negotiating prices with governments of developing countries; and (3) establishing out-licensing agreements, to be considered in lieu of government-mandated patent expropriation.

AB The Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is often described as one of the three pillars of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
   This paper examines the apparent lack of agreement between the two major international instruments; namely TRIPS and the Convention on Biological diversity (CBD). The Trips agreement defines minimum standards of protection for intellectual property rights (IPRs). This paper argues that current forms of bilateralism on IP has negative consequences for developing countries because the "TRIPS Plus" in bilateral agreements, undermine implementation of Doha declaration on TRIPS and Pub'ic Health, traditional knowledge, and biodiversity in poor countries.

SO DIALECTICAL ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This article, based on interviews and documentary sources, examines the participation in the N30 anti-WTO protests of peasants and farmers and, more broadly, the dynamics of transnational protest. It argues that participation in the protests by people from the Global South was important in convincing developing-country WTO delegates to derail the trade talks. The article suggests that N30 in Seattle was more diverse than is usually appreciated, both in terms of the provenance of the participants and in terms of the activities in which they engaged. The significance of N30 has less to do with the proportion of demonstrators who came from the Global South (or of those "of color'') than with the impact that the Seattle events had on those who did come, on developing-country WTO delegates, and on other sympathizers who stayed home but nonetheless followed the situation closely.

AB Although access to medicines has been a critical issue for developing countries, but by agreeing to the TRIPS Agreement and its amendment which has virtually eliminated such access, the internitnla treaty negotiations show that developing countries do not participate in such negotiations. The international power structure has marginalised developing countries completely. This effect of this asymmetrical power structure can be ameliorated to a certain extent by introducing transparency in such negotiations.

AB In this Comment, the author traces the relevant legislative history pertaining to compulsory licensing of patented pharmaceuticals from the TRIPS Agreement of 1994 to the 2003 waiver to, and later proposed amendment of, article 31, which enables poor countries to obtain needed medicines from other countries that possess manufacturing capacity. The Comment then evaluates recent, controversial uses of the relevant legislative machinery as viewed from different critical perspectives. The Comment shows how developing countries seeking access to essential medicines can collaborate in ways that would avoid undermining incentives to innovation and other social costs attributed to compulsory licensing. It ends by defending the legality of recent measures taken to promote public health in developing countries, and by reminding developed countries that unilateral retaliation against such measures is demonstratably illegal under WTO foundational law and jurisprudence.

TI The WTO's telecommunications commitments and the credibility of
   telecommunications regulatory reforms in small island developing states
SO PACIFIC ECONOMIC BULLETIN
AB Telecommunications regulatory reform is a recent phenomenon in small island developing states, including in five Pacific island states in the past five years. Opportunities for regulatory capture exist when independent regulators are vulnerable to political pressure. There is therefore a case for external multilateral policy restraint to deter policymakers from reneging on policies. This study estimates the impact of the telecommunications commitments of the WTO on a panel data set of 160 developing countries ( including 26 small island developing states) during the period 1995-2006. Preliminary evidence is that the credibility of telecommunications reform in small island developing states is enhanced via commitments to WTO telecommunications agreements that lock in domestic reforms. No evidence was found that signing on to bilateral investment treaties enhanced the credibility of telecommunications reform in small island developing states.

TI Developing countries in the ITO and GATT negotiations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The literature examining the participation of developing countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and International Trade Organisation (ITO) negotiations generally sees their attitudes towards these projects as having been driven exclusively by a commitment to import substitution. This commitment, it is argued, led developing countries to oppose many aspects of the GATT/ITO project, particularly the requirement for reciprocal tariff cuts. The purpose of this paper is to focus on examining the critical period around the ultimately doomed negotiation of the Charter for an ITO and the process of creating the GATT.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws from GATT documents and from the literature on economic history to give a more comprehensive account of the motivating ideas underpinning developing countries attitudes to the post-war negotiations.
   Findings - This paper argues that this view misconstrues and caricatures the ideas and motivations underpinning developing countries' attitudes towards the GATT and ITO. Though import substitution and the related objective of industrialisation each played a part in shaping developing countries' attitudes, they are only aspects of a more complex set of aims and ideas. Developing countries were drawing from a range of key experiences and ideas beyond simply import substitution in forming their attitude towards the GATT/ITO project, in particular the volatility in commodity markets that preceded the negotiations, the legacy of colonialism and the lessons provided by the ninetieth and twentieth centuries on trade policy. Finally, this paper argues that the first round of GATT negotiations shows that developing countries were substantially less opposed to reciprocal tariff concessions than has previously been argued.
   Originality/value - These findings are important for anyone who wants to understand the evolution of the GATT and the role developing countries played in it, and the difficulties between the rich and poor nations that continue to characterise negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.

TI Doha merchandise trade reform: What is at stake for developing
   countries?
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The linkage model of the global economy and the latest Global Trade Analysis Project (gtap) database (version 6.05) are used to examine the impact of current merchandise trade barriers and agricultural subsidies and possible reform outcomes of the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Doha Development Agenda. The results suggest that moving to free global merchandise trade would boost real incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa proportionately more than in other developing countries or in high-income countries, despite the terms of trade loss in parts of that region. Particular attention is given to agriculture, as farmers constitute the poorest households in developing countries but the most assisted in rich countries. Net farm incomes would rise substantially in Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing country regions, alleviating rural poverty. Partial liberalization could move the world some way toward those desirable outcomes, the more so the more developing countries themselves cut applied tariffs, particularly on agricultural imports.

TI The Poverty of the Doha Round and the Least Developed Countries
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Two distinct literatures have emerged on the World Trade Organization's Doha Development Agenda (DDA) and its likely benefits for developing countries. One is built on the use of computable general and partial equilibrium simulations, while another explores the political economy of the negotiation process to explore the opportunities a concluded round will bring for developing countries. Both literatures generate important insights into the DDA, and both highlight that the deal on offer to developing countries is very weak. However, there has been little engagement between these two bodies of thought. This paper seeks to begin to redress this, fusing a review of the simulations of likely DDA gains with an examination of the passage of the Doha negotiations. It argues that through this process we can arrive at a fuller understanding of how limited, and problematic, the results of the DDA are likely to be for the less developed countries. If the DDA is to deliver on its mandate, a qualitative shift in the negotiations is required.

TI Developing countries in economic globalization era
SO POLITICKA EKONOMIE
AB This article describes core changes, both theoretical and practical, of DC's action unity and its new features after the globalization acceleration during the 90's and the beginning of 21(st) century. Following re-defintion of basic terminological issues the authors show that the "unity of purpose" famous in the 70's has not yet evaporated as predicted by some authors in the late 80's. The case is analyzed and ilustrated by the failure of 5's WTO Summit in Cancun, September 2003 and also negotiations connected with the creation and activities of Group 21. The problems of agricultural subsidies are in the centre of attention with possible impact on international trade as mainly EU and its new members (including the Czech Republic) is concerned. However, the authors predict that the new LC's "unity of purpose" will be more volatile and fragile than before.

TI Implications of the Doha market access proposals for developing
   countries
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB This paper uses detailed data on bound and applied tariffs to assess the consequences of the WTO's December 2008 Modalities for tariffs levied and faced by developing countries, and the welfare implications of these reforms. We find that the tiered formula for agriculture would halve tariffs in industrial countries and lower them more modestly in developing countries. In non-agricultural market access (NAMA), the formulas would reduce the tariff peaks facing developing countries and cut average industrial country tariffs by more than a third. We use a political-economy framework to assess the implications of flexibilities for the size of the tariff cuts and find they are likely to substantially reduce the outcome. However, despite the flexibilities, there are likely to be worthwhile gains, with applied tariffs facing developing countries cut by about 20% in agriculture and 28% in NAMA, and sizeable cuts in tariffs facing industrial countries. The welfare impacts of reform are evaluated using a new approach to aggregation that improves on the traditional, flawed approach of weighted-average tariffs. This substantially increases the estimated benefits of an agreement along the lines of these modalities, with estimated global income gains of up to $160 billion per year from market access reform.

It briefly discusses the organization of scientific research in post-colonial India and then reflects on the shifts in the nature and scope of scientific research in India and the associated practices that are contingent upon the WTO provisions on the IPRs, as illustrative of the new scenario that is emerging in regard to the participation of developing countries in international collaborative research in the areas of science and technology. The scientific community(1) in India is confronted with the dialectic of resistance and accommodation under the stringent norms of IPRs regime.

AB This paper investigates how the implementation of intellectual property rights in developing countries under the 1995 TRIPS agreement affected trade in knowledge-intensive goods. We compare trade in knowledge-intensive goods with trade in other types of goods for 158 members and observers of the World Trade Organization from 1993-2009. Trade in knowledge-intensive goods increased relative to a control group after TRIPS implementation. The increase in imports by developing countries was driven by exchange with high-income countries and was concentrated in the information and communications technology sector. Our findings suggest that the effect of TRIPS on promoting knowledge diffusion from high-income to developing countries varies by sector.

TI NORTH-SOUTH ASYMMETRY IN TARIFF BARGAINING: A BLESSING FOR THE URBAN
   UNEMPLOYMENT?
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB In this study, North-South asymmetries are incorporated into a general equilibrium model to re-examine tariff bargaining. The asymmetric two-country model indicates that an import tariff charged by the North generates positive externalities that ameliorate structural unemployment in the South. The findings of this study yield two critical respects. First, the consideration of the urban unemployment in the South may reverse the consensus that a reciprocal tariff concession benefits both of the negotiators. Second and hence, this suggests that developing countries may bargain with opponents by manipulating second-best tariffs.

TI Legalization, diplomacy, and development: Do investment treaties
   de-politicize investment disputes?
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Empirical research on the impact of investment treaties has focused almost exclusively on their effect on foreign investment, with mixed results. Yet, another important promise of the treaties has been ignored altogether. Architects of the investment treaty regime, as well as many current proponents, have suggested that the treaties allow developing countries to de-politicize investor-state disputes; i.e. shield commercial disputes from broader political and diplomatic considerations with developed states. While this argument is widely accepted by legal scholars and practitioners and explicitly promoted by capital-exporting states, it has never been subjected to empirical investigation. We provide the first such test, using an original dataset of US diplomatic actions in 219 individual investment disputes across 73 countries as well as detailed case studies drawing on internal US State Department diplomatic cables. We find no evidence for the de-politicization hypothesis: diplomatic engagement remains important for investor-state dispute settlement, and the US government is just as likely to intervene in developing countries that have ratified investment treaties with the US as those that have not. Coercive American intervention in investment disputes is rare, but this is a general feature of American investment diplomacy after the Cold War, rather than one limited to investors with recourse to legalized dispute settlement procedures. These findings provide a critical corrective to our understanding of the investment treaty regime, and have important implications for understanding the effects of international legalization on developing countries.

TI Impact of WTO Policies on Developing Countries: Issues and Perspectives
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB About two thirds of the WTO's around 150 members are developing countries. They play an increasingly important and active role in the WTO because of their numbers, because they are becoming more important in the global economy, and because they increasingly look to trade as a vital tool in their development efforts. An attempt is made in this paper to examine whether the WTO policies have positive or negative effect on the trade of developing countries. The paper further discusses that the Doha Round of Talk is a myth, a fiction, or is it a reality. Can the spirit of Doha, which launched a new round of negotiations and work with an explicit pledge to deliver development-friendly results, be redeemed or not? Finally, it analyses the special differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries.

TI Trade and competition in the WTO: Pondering the applicability of special
   and differential treatment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB This article critically evaluates the potential applicability of special and differential treatment ('S&D') as a mechanism for addressing development concerns often associated with a possible WTO agreement on trade and competition policy. It begins by examining the origins, evolution, and current S&D provisions in the GATT and WTO. It then addresses S&D in a trade and competition context, by first evaluating its broad relevance and then exploring a number of options to formulate the concept in order to most effectively advance development objectives in this nascent area. While the article advocates that S&D could play a valuable role in addressing the special challenges faced by developing countries at this policy interface, it highlights where opinions differ, or empirical evidence is lacking, on the true developmental value of the various options explored. This is particularly the case concerning exceptions and exemptions, to competition regimes, the role of transitional time periods, and the optimal phasing in of competition policy. Thus the article argues that in a trade and competition policy context S&D is not a panacea, and cautions against S&D being used to delay or exempt the introduction of competition disciplines, where such disciplines would be of benefit to developing countries.

AB Currently there are proposals and negotiations regarding the strengthening of protection for geographical indications (GIs) in the World Trade Organization. A major proponent of stronger protection for GIs has been the European Union. One of the arguments it has put forward for stronger protection has been that it will provide an avenue for economic development for agricultural producers in developing countries-a way to capture rents in the markets of developed countries. This paper first outlines the proposed changes to the international protection of GIs. Second, the potential for groups of producers to generate and capture rents in foreign markets is assessed under differing assumptions pertaining to industry structure, product differentiation in the short and long run, barriers to entry, reputation and the form of legal protection in importing countries. A discussion of the resource requirements to establish and maintain a GI is also provided.

I contrast five lines of argument using a multi-country survey of developing countries, focusing on evaluations of the economy, skills, gender, and ideology and measures of involvement with the organizations themselves. At the individual level, respondents have negative views if they have negative views of the state of the economy. More educated respondents are more likely to have negative views of the IEOs. Women are more likely to have positive views of the IEOs than men. National levels of engagement with the IEOs also affect public evaluations of them. Evaluations of the state of the economy are more influential determinants of IEO evaluations in states that receive IMF and World Bank loans, as well as in states that are active in WTO dispute resolution.

The aim is to gain new scientific knowledge about the formation of the customary rules of international law and the political commitments at international level in the interests of developing and least developed countries. The author uses historical and logical methods of scientific knowledge, analyzes the development of international economic relations in the process of providing assistance to developing countries. This article contains historical analysis of the investigated problem subject to the provisions of these important documents in this sphere as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, United Nations Millennium Declaration of 2000, Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development of 2002, Istanbul Declaration on the Least Developed Countries of 2011, Declaration of RIO+20, Addis Ababa Action Programme of 2015 on Financing for Development etc. The author investigates the provision of international assistance to developing countries in such areas as trade, reducing the burden of external debt, technical assistance, increased funding and foreign direct investment, international support domestic reforms, the provision of official development assistance, and others. The article also provides an institutional framework for the study of international economic relations in the interests of developing countries - a description of the main activities in the field of the development of the World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the UN specialized agencies. The author concludes the study of the formation of the historical period at the international level of the complex international legal and political commitments made by the majority of states and aimed at building a stable economic relations with a view to inclusive economic growth for countries in need. Also, the author sums up the close relationship of international standards in the field of promoting socio-economic development of countries in need with the implementation of one of the most important international human rights - the right to development, as established in the Declaration of 1986.

AB Quality standards play an important role in global transactions, but can represent a barrier to trade if they differ across countries. International standards reduce transaction costs and WTO Agreements encourage the use of such standards. This paper presents a simple analytical framework to analyse the welfare effects of quality standards in a trade set-up, with a particular focus on voluntary measures. It illustrates that international standards can have positive or negative welfare effects for individual countries. The paper describes developing countries' involvement in international standard setting bodies and suggests that their engagement needs to be enhanced in order for international standards to work in the advantage of developing economies.

AB In many developing countries, the production and trade in agricultural products plays a crucial role for economic growth and development. It enables countries to cam foreign exchange, to create employment and to invest in sustainable utilization of resources. However, developing countries are often faced with a number of constraints that limit local farmers to develop. First of all, the agricultural sector often remains underdeveloped as a result of inadequate and unbalanced investments compared to the industrial sector. At the same time, farmers have insufficient access to market information and (as a result) have poor bargaining power. Most farmers own small plots of land, and as a result are unable to invest in meeting the stringent international standards to which they need comply. Finally, it is felt that, also at WTO level, trade rules favour multinationals and the developed countries, and not small farmers in developing countries. For these farmers to participate in international trade, KENFAP identified three strategies. The first is to build institutional capacity and self-organization; these will enable farmers to be better informed, improve bargaining power and learn from international best practices. The development of partnerships and networks will further contribute to preparing for market access. Finally it recommends the active support through enabling incentives (policies and regulations) from national and international policymakers.

TI The reform of the common agricultural policy and the Doha Round
SO REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL
AB Developed countries have ignored the agreements reached at the GATT's Uruguay Round. This has generated the reaction of developing countries, now better organized since the beginning of the Doha Round. Developing Countries demand the effective reduction of agricultural subsidies, given that such practices have lowered international prices and therefore ruined many small producers in the South. In this context, the EU has been pushed to cut subsidies to agricultural production and exports. Nevertheless, the final impact of the new Common Agricultural Policy is yet unknown, since negotiations in the Doha Round respond, not only to the interests of member countries and the theoretical defense of world free trade, but also to the interests of transnational corporations. This paper explains how the latest reforms of ACP have responded to negotiations within GATT and the WTO, as well as their impact in the world agricultural market and in the agriculture of developing countries.

Drawing on several hundreds of complaints received by the WTO since the establishment of the organization and till 2014, we demonstrate that the developing countries have a smaller probability of successful resolution in the dispute than the developed countries. This inequality can be explained by differences in the size of economies (GDP), but the paper shows that differences in the country's experience of participation in WTO disputes have a higher predictive power.

TI Child labour: parameters, developmental implications, causes and
   consequences
SO CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB An examination into the incidence of child labour in developing countries will require an analysis of the reasons for its occurrence, which in turn will go a long way in indicating a possible route towards providing a solution. This article will clarify why child labour rather than child work in general is an issue for concern, submitting that it is the type of work that impedes the education and development of children that needs to be addressed. A distinction between the two prevailing motivations behind calls for developing countries to address child labour will be drawn, and the article will pursue that only the human rights motivation will provide the requisite cooperation and commitment in attaining sustainable and effective elimination of child labour. In analysing statistics that child labour occurs predominantly in developing countries, the article will reflect on current global trends to submit that child labour in developing countries can have a global impact. Considering the various reasons that have been attributed to cause child labour in developing countries, it will be demonstrated that poverty is a common element in all such attributes. In discussing the possible solutions, the article will submit that developing countries with child labour problems do not have the resources for the necessary intervention to tackle a problem of such magnitude and, therefore, international effort is necessary. Discussions on the international forum to coordinate these efforts will establish that a forum free of trade links is needed, thereby dispelling suggestions that the World Trade Organisation and sanctions-based approach is the best solution. The article will conclude that work should be undertaken building on International Labour Organisation standards, if such standards are beneficial to child development. The problem may lie in developing countries, but only global efforts can offer a solution.

TI The protection of geographical indications after Doha: Quo vadis?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB During the last twenty years the international protection of geographical indications (GIs) has experienced a worldwide resurgence spurred by both the greater need and the additional opportunities offered by the global marketplace for the diversification of agricultural products and foodstuffs. The Doha Ministerial Declaration lends support to developing countries that are seeking forms of knowledge less than high technology that they have the capacity to exploit. June 2005 saw the European Communities submit a radical proposal, designed to also meet the needs of developing countries that would amend the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement in favour of a mandatory multilateral system of registration for all products. Yet, World Trade Organization (WTO) Members are as divided over their capacity to take advantage of GI protection no less than they are as to the means of regulation. To date, no ready solution to the further global harmonization of GIs has been found. This paper examines the two major regulatory models advanced by the European Union and the United States of America for the protection of GIs. In the light of the Doha Development Agenda, the authors argue in favour of an incremental approach that would allow developing countries the flexibility to adjust additional protection in accordance with their level of economic development.

TI Can the WTO reduce agricultural trade distortions?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB Earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed by anti-agricultural biases in own-country price and trade policies, as well as by governments of richer countries favoring local farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic welfare, add to global inequality and poverty, and are mostly the result of trade restrictions. Yet until recently they have not been disciplined by the GATT or WTO. New evidence illustrates where the GATT and WTO have failed to prevent rises in agricultural protectionism, including in developing countries. Global economy wide modeling results reveal that substantial trade policy reform has been achieved since the mid-1980s in ways that have helped developing country farmers, but that there remains very considerable scope for further farm policy reform. In the decades ahead, the effects of policies on farmers and others in developing countries depend on whether an ambitious Doha Round agreement is signed and countries continue the recent trends towards free trade. Should Doha fail, agricultural protectionism may well grow in emerging economies, suggesting that the stakes in the Doha Round are much higher than is traditionally believed.

TI Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries
SO HANDBOOK OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, VOL 1B
SE Handbooks in Economics
AB Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries (SDT) constitutes a central feature of the GATT/WTO system. Its formal goal is to foster export-led growth in developing countries. Its theoretical foundations and empirical support are, however, weak at best. In particular, SDT conflicts with the GATT's two key principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination, compromising the efficiency of the multilateral trading system. Still, if SDT provisions help those who most need help, sacrificing economic efficiency may be justifiable. However, there are numerous criticisms, on theoretical and empirical grounds, to the premises and the achievements of SDT-based disciplines, casting serious doubt on its effectiveness in helping developing countries trade and grow. For researchers, the good news is that there is plenty of room for progress, with several important areas where our understanding remains unsatisfactory but progress is feasible-that is, where the expected return to research effort seems unusually high.

TI What strategies are viable for developing countries today? The World
   Trade Organization and the shrinking of 'development space'
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The world is currently experiencing a surge of international regulations aimed at limiting the development policy options of developing country governments. Of the three big agreements coming out of the Uruguay Round - on investment measures (TRIMS), trade in services (GATS), and intellectual property rights (TRIPS) - the first two limit the authority of developing country governments to constrain the choices of companies operating in their territory, while the third requires the governments to enforce rigorous property rights of foreign (generally Western) firms. Together the agreements make comprehensively illegal many of the industrial policy instruments used in the successful East Asian developers to nurture their own industrial and technological capacities and are likely to lock in the position of Western countries at the top of the world hierarchy of wealth. The paper describes how the three agreements constitute a modern version of Friedrich List's 'kicking away the ladder'. It then outlines some needed changes in the way we think about development and in the role of multilateral organizations. It concludes that the practical prospects for change along these lines are slender, but not negligible.

TI Reflections on Developing Countries' Initiation of Disputes in the WTO
   Dispute Settlement System
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB The establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has presented a major improvement in international trade liberalization to the benefit, as claimed, of all its members. Such improvement is reflected in the comprehensive legal framework of the WTO trading system, which is based on detailed rules regulating various aspects of international trade, and a dispute settlement system ensuring the implementation of such rules and safeguarding rights and interests associated with the system's membership.
   Each of these two elements complements the other. The dispute settlement system needs to be based on comprehensive rules that provide a clear detail on members' rights and obligations, and such rules are useless in the absence of an effective dispute settlement process that guarantees the protection of members' rights and the enforcement of their obligations.
   The efficiency of the WTO dispute settlement system is not only measured by its mechanism's detail and strictness, but also by its accessibility and ability to accommodate the different positions of all WTO members in a way that ensures an optimal utilization of the system. Developing countries are still struggling in accessing the WTO dispute settlement system and reinstating their violated WTO-protected rights and interests, which undermines not only the integrity of the dispute settlement system, but also the whole organization.
   This study focuses on the participation of developing countries in the WTO dispute settlement process, outlining the main issues that affect such participation. In doing so, the initiation stage, where countries make the decision to participate or not, is going to be the focus, as it provides a clear indication on the general position of developing countries in the process of dispute settlement in general.

TI How Cultural Cognition Informs Differential Treatment in WTO Law and the

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Climate change is a core issue for sustainable development and exacerbates inequality. However, in both the WTO and the climate regime, disagreements over differential treatment have hampered efforts to address international inequalities in a way that facilitates effective responses to global issues. Sustainable globalization requires bridging the disparities between developed and developing countries in their capacities to address such matters of global concern. However, differential treatment now functions as a distraction from the global issues it was supposed to address. Cognitive biases distort perceptions regarding the climate crisis and the value of multilateralism. To what extent can cognitive science inform decision making by States? How do we change paradigms (cognitive background assumptions), which limit the options that decision-making elites in developed and developing countries perceive as useful and worth considering? To what extent do cognitive biases and cultural cognition create a barrier to multilateral cooperation on issues of global concern?

TI Emerging Powers, Leadership, and South-South Solidarity: The Battle Over
   Special and Differential Treatment at the WTO
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Emerging powers, such as China and India, have used claims of developing world leadership and South-South solidarity to strengthen their bargaining position in WTO negotiations. Yet analysis of the growing battle over special and differential treatment (SDT) suggests that such claims are increasingly tenuous. The question of how emerging economic powers should be classified and treated under global trade rules has become an acute source of conflict in the trade regime. The emerging powers insist on access to SDT as an unconditional right of developing countries. But in a debate dominated by the emerging and established powers, the interests of most developing countries have been largely overlooked. Drawing on the cases of agriculture and fisheries - two areas of international trade of particular importance to the developing world - I show that extending SDT to the emerging powers is increasingly problematic for global development. In these areas, many emerging economies are now among the world's largest subsidizers, and the harmful effects of their policies are felt most keenly by other developing countries. Granting SDT to exempt emerging subsidizers from WTO disciplines would therefore undermine efforts to use global trade rules to promote global development, as well as to protect the environment.

AB India's trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) compliant Patent (Amendment) Act 2005 saw the transformation of its laws from a process patent regime to a product patent regime. The amendments have had a direct impact on India's generic drugs manufacturing sector, which was developed through the process patent regime introduced under the 1970 Act. The knock-on effect will soon be felt both domestically and globally, as a number of developing countries have come to rely strongly on Indian generics. This article seeks to study the effectiveness of the Act of 2005, and if it can be seen as an instance of success of the TRIPS provisions in Articles 7 and 8 read along with the Doha Declaration. It will be queried if developing countries in the World Trade Organization can possibly benefit from the model set-up by India for the issuance of compulsory licenses, and to check the practice of 'evergreening' by pharmaceutical patent holders. Recent decisions from the Indian judiciary and the quasi-judicial authorities, along with the procedures and policies put in place will be used to carry out the study.

TI EU PREFERENTIAL TRADE OFFER TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: MODALITIES AND
   INTERACTIONS
SO REVISTA DE DERECHO COMUNITARIO EUROPEO
AB This work examines the several tariff preferences granted by the EU to developing countries and the relationship among them. This examination covers the autonomous preferences of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the conventional preferences included in several trade liberalization agreements (Economic Partnership Agreements and others) between the EU and developing countries. This paper highlights that tariff preferences are currently being used to increase the geographical spread of regulations which have not yet been agreed by the WTO, specifically regarding trade related matters (environment, social rights, etc.). These regulations are doctrinally known as extra-OMC obligations. This study submits that the negotiation of a trade liberalizations arrangement between the EU and a custom union that includes LDCs members may be counterproductive. The main reason is that it may dilute the said custom union into a free trade area in those cases in which a participating LDC decides to benefit from EU's GSP called Everything but Arms. Finally, it is noted that, in the future EU's GSP, the EU will strengthen its policy of differentiation among various developing countries excluding those classified by the World Bank as middle-income countries.

AB The paper identifies the need for improvements in policy space for developing and least developed countries under the current world trading system by examining the use of WTO dispute settlement system with descriptive statistics and case studies. The paper shows an asymmetry in the utilization of the dispute settlement system and the consequence of using the system between developed and developing countries. For instance, the paper demonstrates that the United States and some other developed countries use WTO rules effectively, resulting in the defeat of developing countries in disputes. These developing countries are forced to abandon their industrial policy measures. By contrast, the United States and the other de-veloped countries continue to use WTO-inconsistent industrial policies in need without being much effectively challenged. Based on our findings, we suggest what should be done within the practices of the current rules, what can be done to change the current global rules, and what developing countries can still try under the current rules.

   analysis under the restrictive trade regime
SO JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE
AB Global textile and clothing (T&C) export restraints had been enforced for nearly 50 years under the Short-Term Arrangement, Long-Term Arrangement, and the Multi-fibre Arrangement. With the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, a 10-year quota phasing out transitional period governed by the Agreement on Textile and Clothing was agreed with quota abolition by the end of 2004. This paper analyses the T&C exports from developed and developing countries under the Multi-fibre Arrangement and Agreement on Textile and Clothing from 1990 to 2004 and reveals that there existed a gradual shift of increasing T&C exports by developing countries. The scenarios for the 20 leading global T&C exporters, which assumed 80%-90% of the global export value, were analysed separately by time-series regression modelling during the prescribed period. Results showed that developed countries were seriously affected in the past 15 years and some developing countries would likely become potential global leaders in T&C exports with the abolishment of quotas.

AB The purpose of this chapter is to report some initial findings based on the WTO Dispute Settlement Data Set (Ver. 2.0) that the authors have compiled for the World Bank. The data set contains approximately 28 000 observations on the workings of the Dispute Settlement system. It covers all 351 WTO disputes initiated through the official filing of a Request for Consultations from January 1, 1995, until October 25, 2006; and for these disputes it includes events occurring until December 31, 2006. Each dispute is followed through its legal life via the panel stage, the Appellate Body stage, to the implementation stage.
   The descriptive statistics in the chapter points to three observations. The first and obvious observation is the almost complete absence of least developed countries. Second, less poor and developing countries are much more active and successful than the authors would have expected. Third, the EU and the United States dominate less than expected, being much more often the subject of complaints, than a complaining party, and they have a very low share of all panelists.

Developing country members may delay the full application of the TRIPS obligations until 1 January 2000, least developed countries until 1 January 2005. By that time their own systems for intellectual property protection must not only be adjusted to the minimum standards required by the TRIPS Agreement, but must also have implemented provisions for patent protection in fields not yet covered by IPR protection, for instance for living matter.

   Round
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Developing countries have been characterized by some eminent writers on the GATT as having played an essentially defensive role in the GATT, unwilling to make tariff concessions, and are said to have focused almost exclusively on securing special and differential treatment concessions. This perspective has become part of the conventional wisdom in the academic literature on the GATT. This paper argues, based on empirical evidence, that the conventional argument is not an accurate description of the role of developing countries in the ITO and the GATT and that developing countries have played an active role in shaping the agenda of the GATT/WTO.

TI Turkey's Foreign Trade and New Markets for Turkey
SO GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON TRADE INTEGRATION AND ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION
SE Advances in Finance Accounting and Economics
AB The share of developing countries in the world trade is increasing every day. According to an assessment made by the World Trade Organization (WTO), a share of developing countries in the world export is expected to rise by 8.5% in the years ahead. Turkey's share in the world trade is around 1%, and it is expected to increase up to 1.5% by 2023. Turkey is ranked 22nd in the world export and 15th in the world import of goods. Turkey's current problems are account and trade deficits. New markets will potentially offer an opportunity to overcome both account and trade deficits. The aim of this chapter is to define new export markets for Turkey. According to the survey results, Turkey may potentially increase its export to the USA. Apart from the USA, Germany and Russia will continue to serve as export markets for Turkey in the years ahead. Therefore, Turkish companies will maintain their existing trade relations with these countries.

TI Distributional effects of WTO agricultural reforms in rich and poor
   countries
SO ECONOMIC POLICY
CT 44th Economic Policy Panel Meeting
CY OCT 21, 2006
CL Helsinki, FINLAND
SP Bank Finland
AB Rich countries' agricultural trade policies are the battleground on which the future of the WTO's troubled Doha Round will be determined. Subject to widespread criticism, they nonetheless appear to be almost immune to serious reform, and one of their most common defences is that they protect poor farmers. Our findings reject this claim. The analysis conducted here uses detailed data on farm incomes to show that major commodity programmes are highly regressive in the US, and that the only serious losses under trade reform are among large, wealthy farmers in a few heavily protected sub-sectors. In contrast, analysis using household data from 15 developing countries indicates that reforming rich countries' agricultural trade policies would lift large numbers of developing country farm households out of poverty. In the majority of cases these gains are not outweighed by the poverty-increasing effects of higher food prices among other households. Agricultural reforms that appear feasible, even under an ambitious Doha Round, achieve only a fraction of the benefits for developing countries that full liberalization promises, but protect the wealthiest US farms from most of the rigors of adjustment. Finally, the analysis conducted here indicates that maximal trade-led poverty reductions occur when developing countries participate more fully in agricultural trade liberalization.

SO POLITICKA EKONOMIE
AB This article tries to summarize achievements of ten years anniversary of WTO (1995-2005) and the negotiations taking place at its summits from Seattle (1999) to Hongkong (2005). These achievements could be characterized at best as mediocre ones. WTO has been muddling through numerous disputes, the most important of which have been and still are agricultural subsidies of developed countries. Due to double standards and sometimes lack of transparency at least three summits (Seattle, Cancun and Doha) almost failed and the Katar Round ended deadlocked for 2004. The last Hongkong summit (December 2005) saved WTO functionality mainly through some concessions demanded by developing countries' since 1998. Katar Round, unfortunately, is still far from any safe landing. Nevertheless, the article praises some good results, too. The whole decade of such partial and practical struggling open, hovewer, also some issues important for theory of international economics, for example such as optimality of global vers. regional-subregional options for the future international trade liberalization, etc. The article, of course, cannot pretend solving but only draws attention of academic research resp. sorting them and establishing their hierarchy.

TI TRIPS-Plus Implications for Access to Medicines in Developing Countries:
   Lessons from Jordan-United States Free Trade Agreement
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 and implementation of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as a result, the United States (US) sought to impose still higher levels of intellectual property rights on developing countries, a phenomenon that is commonly known today as TRIPSPlus. The Jordan-US FTA, signed in 2001, contains several TRIPS-Plus rules that restrict the poor's access to medicines, and is today touted by US officials and the US Trade Representative (USTR) as a success, and providing a wide range of benefits. These benefits not only include a higher growth rate, but also more specific benefits to the pharmaceutical sector in particular, such as an improved ability to develop generic medicine and engage in new innovative research, as well as increasing the presence of and collaboration with multinational drug makers. This article analyzes in detail the TRIPS-Plus provisions of the Jordan-US FTA. It challenges the claims that the FTA brings general and specific benefits to developing countries, and provides fresh evidence which strongly suggests that benefits from the Jordan-US FTA have been largely exaggerated while the costs underestimated.

The framework draws on total quality management (TQM) models as its theoretical basis and was developed through an expert group panel, interviews, and focus group workshops. To verify the framework, pilot implementation was conducted in four countries. The results show that the proposed framework is useful for measuring the strengths and weaknesses of overall capability per pillar and category in a national standards system. The paper contributes to the expansion of the TQM model in assessing national level capability by more effective evaluation and systematic development of national standards systems for developing countries.

TI Regulations for mycotoxins: health protection v. economy?
SO MAGYAR ALLATORVOSOK LAPJA
AB For protecting consumer health more and more, recently at least 99 countries have introduced tolerable limits for mycotoxins. European Union applies the strongest limits, which are strongly criticized by WTO, and by developing countries and some developed countries (Australia, USA), as well. Economic losses for developing countries arising from the refused export of mycotoxin contaminated food and feed above tolerable limit are considerable. In the food trade the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission plays a central role in setting non-discriminative international standards based on scientific risk assessment.
   This paper summarizes the risk assessment activity of Codex, regarding some mycotoxins and the recent state of the world-wide mycotoxin regulation. Based upon scientific papers, it considers the connection between the health gain in developed countries and the effect of regulation on trade and economy.

TI EC-Chicken Cuts: How Developing Countries Obtained Increased Market
   Access Through Successful Recourse to WTO Dispute Settlement
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Some developing countries have learned from experience that WTO dispute settlement is by no means an abstract exercise. Instead, the WTO dispute settlement process has produced tangible benefits in the form of enhanced market access for key developing country exports, thus contributing to a rise in standards of living in those countries. This article examines how in EC - Chicken Cuts, two developing country Members, Thailand and Brazil, were able to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to challenge successfully EU customs classification measures that adversely affected their market access for exports of chicken products. Following their victory at the WTO, Thailand and Brazil were able to gain increased market access for chicken exports to Europe. The dispute illustrates how developing countries can successfully use the rules-based system in the WTO to level the playing field with large, developed country Members.

TI Prospects and Challenges of Embedding the Human Right to Food
   Obligations into the Legal Framework for International Agricultural
   Trade Regulation
SO COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICA-CILSA
AB Although many academic commentators have long argued that the World Trade Organization (WTO)-driven liberal rules of international agricultural trade regulation have a negative effect on the enjoyment of the human right to food, especially in developing countries, there is still a dearth of scholarship offering proposals to ameliorate the situation. This article fills this gap by presenting a discussion of the possible avenues for accommodating the food security-related human rights obligations of states in the extant legal framework for international agricultural trade regulation. It argues that such a development, among other measures, is a plausible response to the problem of food insecurity endemic in developing countries and which manifests in international agricultural trade regulation. The article contends that for the WTO to effectively address the human right to food concerns of developing countries, the free trade regulations, as practised in international agricultural trade, must be complemented with the human right to food as a supreme norm sine qua non lege. It is concluded that this eminently desirable outcome can be achieved through the assimilation of the human right to food into the 'public morals clause' of Article XX of the GATT, reading the human right to food into the Agreement on Agriculture, adopting some WTO Ministerial Conference proposals, re-configuring some WTO dispute settlement practices, and lastly, by adopting the proposal of the UN Special Rapporteur on the human right to food.

AB We are in the midst of a dramatic extension in the global reach of the patent system. Public concern over the price of HIV/AIDS drugs in Africa has focused attention on this new global system and generated a debate between those who support the establisbment of strong patent laws to protect pharmaceuticals in developing countries and those who, in various ways, would weaken them. But the choice does not have to be limited to strong or weak. This article describes a policy that would improve on the current patent regime by acknowledging the differences in pharmaceutical markets in rich and poor countries and what they imply for optimal patent protection. It would lower the price of pharmaceuticals in developing countries for a selected group of global diseases-those that, like cancer, affect people everywhere-while allowing protection to increase where it is most likely to lead to the creation of new products for diseases that affect primarily people in developing countries. The proposal requires no changes in international treaties, no changes in the adoption in poor countries of patent systems that comply with membership requirements of the World Trade Organization, and only minor changes in the patent laws of rich countries. Because the policy would be largely self-enforcing and use existing institutions, it would cost very little to introduce or administer and thus would not divert spending from other important health and development projects.

CT 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC)
CY DEC 10-13, 2017
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
SP WTO
AB In anticipation of the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11), several developing country Members submitted proposals reflecting concerns related with e-commerce and the continued involvement of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in cross-border e-commerce. Some developing countries perceive the booming significance of MSMEs as an opportunity to further enhance their economic relevance by incorporating them into e-commerce. The increase of MSMEs in e-commerce has also been reflected by the International Trade Centre (ITC). In one of the ITC's most recent surveys conducted on 2262 firms, the statistics indicated that of the firms that engage solely in cross-border e-commerce, 82% are MSMEs. Notwithstanding these significant changes on the ground, Members have differed significantly in their views since 1998 concerning the e-commerce agenda. This has created considerable inroads in defining what e-commerce is as well as the rules that should regulate e-commerce. More recently, the e-commerce dialogue has reflected concerns on how the WTO could potentially deal with the rapid inclusion of MSMEs in the market through e-commerce. Although all companies face red tape in cross-border trade, due to size and financial constraints, MSMEs in developing countries face the most challenges in cross-border e-commerce. Many of these problems are related to the cross-border delivery of goods, the after-sales services as well as limited cross-border de minimis exemptions that discourages MSMEs from e-trading. Therefore, several Members consider that it is vital to continue to work on trade facilitation matters, especially those that are forward looking and can better assist MSMEs to better integrate into the e-commerce world. This article adopts two specific discussion points based on the proposals submitted by different Members for the WTO MC11 suggesting ways to move forward. First, using case studies from different countries, the article will focus on some of the challenges faced by MSMEs in developing countries, such as inefficient customs administration which is a result of issues related to cross-border trade. Part of this discussion will also assess how developing countries can use the recently agreed TFA to address these issues. The second part of the article will focus on how current provisions in the TFA as well as other forward looking trade facilitation efforts that are not reflected in the agreement, can help MSMEs to benefit from cross-border e-commerce. In relation to this part of the discussion, an exploration of the possibilities of technical assistance and capacity building that is e-commerce relevant would thus be necessary. Finally the article will conclude, highlighting limitations associated with the recommendations given. We have two challenges at WTO on E-commerce. One is defining what E-commerce means for everyone and two is inclusivity in trade for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

TI The Trade Facilitation Agreement: A New Hope for the World Trade
   Organization
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB The new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) is a significant step forward for the international trading regime, representing new hope for the relevance of the WTO. The TFA is the first multilateral agreement since the creation of the WTO in 1995 and includes novel measures to help developing countries build capacity, while also taking into consideration regulatory concerns of WTO members through the application of the general GATT exceptions to the new agreement. While the TFA may appear narrow in scope, with regards to goods it is arguably the broadest WTO Agreement besides the GATT, since all goods that cross national borders find themselves subject to trade facilitation measures. If the TFA is properly interpreted, the combination of capacity-building measures, a focus on technological improvements and the judicious invocation of Article XX could result in a win-win situation wherein routine positive trade is streamlined, reducing time required to cross borders, while negative trade is more easily controlled and regulated at the border. Despite regulatory questions concerning implementation, it is likely that the TFA will reduce the cost of trading across borders, while improving trade for developing countries and allowing WTO members to better control trade flows, through a combination of procedural streamlining and regulatory discretion.

TI China's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the exports
   of the developing economies of East Asia: a computable general
   equilibrium approach
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB There is a general perception particularly among the developing countries of East Asia that China's WTO membership would spell bad news for their exports. The ASEAN countries in particular are quite concerned about its likely negative impact on their export and growth potentials. In this light, the main objective of this paper is to empirically assess the trade implications of China's WTO membership for these countries. Only few studies, using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach, have addressed the issue of China's WTO membership trade implications. Further, these studies have not adequately addressed the issue from the perspective of the developing countries of East Asia, particularly the ASEAN countries.
   Using the latest version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and based on the latest tariff reduction commitments by China, the results showed that, contrary to the current perception and previous studies, almost all of the developing countries of East Asia are likely to benefit from China's WTO membership overall, after allowing for anticipated price adjustments. Without the price adjustments, the Philippines and Singapore would have come out as net losers.
   These findings have confirmed the need for economic and export restructuring among the ASEAN countries and the importance of accelerating their economic integration. They have also highlighted the importance of promoting trade and investment cooperation between China and ASEAN countries.

TI Developing WTO Members as Users and Targets of Anti-dumping Policy
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB For most of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1947 era, the use of anti-dumping duties was typically limited to a small circle of developed countries. However, starting with the final years of the GATT 1947 era and especially in the WTO era, there has been a considerable expansion in the use of anti-dumping measures in general, and especially by developing countries. Today, developing countries represent the majority of both users and targets of anti-dumping measures. Like developed country users, developing countries have imposed many measures against exporters from other developing countries. The article discusses these trends and the underlying detailed statistics. The article concludes that anti-dumping policy is an integral part of the modern international trade policy landscape, and that the significant and increasing involvement of developing countries both as users and targets gives rise to an increased need for technical capacity on their part.

TI Government Procurement Outside the GPA: A Developing Country View
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Since the early days of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), government procurement has been a topic sensitive to the developing world. Developed nations with the aim of promoting competition, transparency and enhanced value for money, entered into a plurilateral agreement to govern government procurement. This was later revised to enhance the level of commitments. Currently, over forty-eight WTO Members are signatories to the plurilateral agreement on government procurement. This leaves a large proportion of the membership still tied to the GATT-era commitments on government procurement. The extent of these commitments was later extended to other multilateral agreements such as the TRIMS (Trade Related Investment Measures), SCM Agreement (Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures), and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This article aims to identify the extent of the commitments related to government procurement in these multilateral agreements and map out the policy space available to the developing countries.

Since 2005, about fifty government lawyers from ten different LDCs and eighteen different developing countries have participated in the Secondment Programme. This article reviews the criteria for participation in the Programme and the selection process. It also reviews feedback from former participants, and notes that the vast majority of former seconded lawyers continue to work for their governments, and have found the work experience and skills gained from the Secondment Programme have contributed to their government's capacity to understand and manage WTO issues. They also found that their participation in the Programme enhanced their professional development and career advancement. The article reviews the individual reflections of three former junior counsel from India, Malawi and Viet Nam who joined the Secondment Programme in 2014-2015, and found the experience to be enriching.

TI Globalisation and the regulation of FDI: recent proposals
SO RESEARCH HANDBOOK ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATION
AB Professor Ajit Singh analyses some of the main risks posed by the foreign direct investment (FDI) of multi-national enterprises for developing country economic development. His critical analysis of FDI forms the basis of his sceptical view of the proposals by the European Union and Japan in the mid 2000s to create a liberalised multilateral investment regime within the World Trade Organisation to govern FDI between WTO members. Although this proposal later failed to achieve consensus amongst WTO member states during the collapsed Doha Trade Round negotiations of 2006-2008, Professor Singh argues that weaknesses remain in the existing international regime that consists of thousands of bilateral investment treaties, most of which involving developed and developing countries limit the discretion of developing countries to regulate adequately their economies and thereby protect themselves from market failure. Although the EU and Japan's proposal failed, another version of it could be resurrected in future global trade round negotiations and therefore developing countries should be vigilant.

TI Barriers to trade in environmental goods: How important they are and
   what should developing countries expect from their removal
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Few developing countries have participated in the environmental goods agreement (EGA) negotiations to reduce barriers on trade in Environmental Goods (EGs). Reasons for this reluctance are first reviewed along with a comprehensive description of barriers to trade (tariffs and NTBs) on two lists of EGs used in negotiations: the APEC list comprising mostly industrial products representative of high-income countries that served as point of departure on the negotiations for an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) and a list of Environmentally Preferable Products (EPPs) more representative of the perceived interests of developing countries. The paper then revisits and extends the literature on the estimation of barriers to trade in EGs for these lists. These estimates are carried out with a structural gravity model with: (i) new data on bilateral (rather than MFN) tariffs, and a new classification of NTBs; (ii) a measure of regulatory overlap in bilateral trade. Results show that tariffs reduce the intensity of bilateral trade. Regulatory harmonization, as captured by an increase in regulatory overlap is also estimated to be conducive to more intense bilateral trade. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing the Doha Round: Market access, transactions costs and aid for
   trade facilitation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper compares the predicted trade impacts of a successful Doha Round with the trade effects of actions aimed at reducing domestic trade costs for traders in developing countries and the world as a whole. We show that a relatively small reduction in trade costs will generate trade impacts that are larger than what is likely to emerge even from a relatively ambitious Doha Round market access outcome. This illustrates the importance of complementing market access commitments with measures to reduce trade costs in developing countries which is the objective of the trade facilitation negotiations in the Doha Round - and additional aid for trade to assist countries in covering the costs of improving trade-related procedures and processes.

TI More or Less Ambition in the Doha Round? Modeling the Development Impact
   of Recent Proposals
SO EUROCHOICES
AB We analyse the impact on developing countries, whose economies depend heavily on agriculture, of a WTO Doha Development Round agreement based on greater or lesser levels of ambition. We present the results of an ambitious versus an unambitious Doha Round outcome, using the MIRAGE model of the global economy, with a special focus on developing countries. Our simulations are based on negotiating proposals from the run-up to the Hong Kong ministerial meeting but not agreed upon in December 2005. We compare those outcomes with the estimated effects of full global trade liberalization. The results for the two Doha scenarios demonstrate the high stakes of this negotiation given the positions of EU, US and the G-20 coalition. A successful round could deliver real gains both globally and for developing countries, but the magnitude of those gains depends on the shape of the agreement. A reform outcome based on the most ambitious components of the negotiating proposals of the US and EU delivers noticeably greater benefits than an unambitious outcome. Developing countries are exposed to very contrasting fortunes. The details matter in the differing proposals, such as the tariff and domestic support reduction formulae, tariff caps, and number of sensitive and special products. Negotiating commitment and diligence are needed in 2006 to avoid a hollow Doha outcome given the technical character of these details.

TI Effect of multilateral trade liberalization on foreign direct investment
   outflows amid structural economic vulnerability in developing countries
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This paper examines whether both multilateral trade policy liberalization and structural economic vulnerability (EVI) matter for outward foreign direct investment (FDI), which like FDI inflows, could substantially contribute to economic development in developing countries. The empirical analysis is carried out on a panel data of 112 countries over the period 1998-2013. It leads to two major conclusions: first, multilateral trade policy liberalization encourages outward FDI, while higher structural economic vulnerability discourages it. The lower the countries' development level, the higher the positive impact of multilateral trade liberalization on FDI outflows. Likewise, the lower the countries' development level, the greater the negative effect of EVI on outward FDI. Second, the positive effect of multilateral trade policy liberalization on FDI outflows could be undermined by the rise in structural economic vulnerability. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that reviving multilateral talks in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and reaching concrete outcomes that could be benefit all WTO Members, and promote FDI outflows, particularly for developing countries. Moreover, the support of the international community to governments in developing countries (in particular poorest ones) is critical to mitigate structural economic vulnerability faced by these countries and helps these countries take advantage of the multilateral trade policy liberalization, notably in terms here of FDI outflows.

TI HOW DOES THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM WORK FOR WTO MEMBERS? A
   COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The WTO dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) is now facing a crisis of paralysis. Given such a challenging environment, this study examines factors affecting the participation of the WTO DSM by using bilateral data of WTO members from 1995 to 2017. Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis of the factors affecting the filing of cases at the WTO DSM between developed and developing countries across this period. By conducting the rare-event logistic regression method, we find that the export intensity, retaliation capability, economic power and economic threat are the main factors determining the initiation of trade disputes by WTO members. Moreover, the results from seemingly unrelated regressions suggest that economic power, proxied by the complainant country's gross national income, is not a vital issue of importance that developed countries need to consider when deciding to initiate trade disputes; however, in contrast, developing countries still see it as an important factor affecting the use of DSMs, especially when the target countries are developed countries. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that in the later stage of the WTO, the impact of economic power no longer has any differential influence. On balance, these results reflect the efforts of the WTO to build a fair and rule-based DSM while also highlighting the urgent practical significance of maintaining a solid and effective mechanism for handling international trade disputes.

TI Assisting Developing and Least Developed Countries in Legal Aspects of
   WTO Negotiations: A Case Study of the Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB The Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL) is an international organization charged with assisting developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs) in all legal aspects arising from the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Among its services, the ACWL provides, upon request, legal advice in WTO negotiations. The ACWL does not influence the political position of its Members or the LDCs. Rather, it confines itself to providing legal inputs that would enable its developing country Members and LDCs better to participate in WTO negotiations. In particular, the ACWL assists in drafting proposed legal provisions when a requesting government wishes to propose an idea. In addition, the ACWL conducts legal analyses of proposals tabled by other WTO Members in order to ascertain their potential legal effects were they to become part of the WTO covered agreements. In the context of the fisheries subsidies negotiations, the ACWL has made strides to become familiar with such areas as international law of the sea, fisheries law, and the legal aspects of sustainability and development in order to provide well informed legal advice to its developing country Members and the LDCs. Legal advice on the fisheries subsidies negotiations has, both qualitatively and quantitatively, become an important part of the ACWL's work.

TI Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPSA) was negotiated with a view to setting in place an array of multilateral rules that would, on the one hand, recognize the legitimate right of WTO Members to adopt sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, and on the other, enshrine certain checks and balances to cope with the possibility of these measures emerging as non-tariff barriers (NTBs). However, the experiences of developing countries including India with SPS requirements imposed particularly by the developed countries bear testimony to the fact that SPSA has thus far proved rather ineffective in living up to the latter objective. This is largely attributable to the fact that, its dual objective notwithstanding, SPSA has left considerable space for WTO Members to use SPS measures for protectionist purposes under the guise of their legitimate concerns. This space seems to have been further reinforced by the mode of interpretation of SPSA by the WTO Dispute Settlement System. Written against this backdrop, the present article brings to the fore some of the key SPS challenges facing the developing countries by taking India as a case in point and explores certain plausible strategies to cope with such challenges in an effective manner.

TI Development from Within? The Potential for Geographical Indications in
   the Global South
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB In debates in the World Trade Organization over the protection of geographical indications (GIs), the European Union (EU) has framed its position in terms of the potential for GIs to protect local cultures, offer a quality guarantee to consumers, and provide opportunities for value-added agriculture. A key tenet of the EU's argument is that GI schemes can be successfully implemented in developing countries as well as Europe. However, my analysis of the case of tequila shows that GIs in developing countries face unique challenges. Tequila is the oldest GI outside of Europe, and is often cited as an example of a successful GI in a developing country. Despite obvious successes in terms of its market share, however, the GI for tequila has largely failed to benefit the local population and environment. My examination of the tequila case illustrates how, throughout the history of the evolving GI legislation for tequila, influential actors have manipulated production standards in ways that contradict the theoretical concept of a GI and negatively affect the overall quality of tequila. I situate this case within the larger framework of international legislation on GIs, arguing that higher standards and a more context-specific approach are necessary.

TI Access to medicines and the TRIPS Agreement: what next for sub-Saharan
   Africa?
SO INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW
AB When the proposal for an international intellectual property (IP) rights protection was included as an item in the agenda for negotiation in the Uruguay Round of World Trade Organization negotiations, it was strongly opposed by developing countries including Brazil, India, Argentina and others. The developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs) from Africa, realising the difficulties the Agreement would put them in, had vigorously campaigned against the inclusion of IP rights protection within the multilateral trading system. One of the chief areas of concern for the developing countries and LDCs was the difficulty of accessing affordable medicines under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) regime. While the resistance was gradually eroded and eventually neutralised during the long drawn Uruguay Round of Negotiations, the developing countries and the LDCs gained a few concessions in the post-TRIPS era in the form of Doha Declaration, which in their opinion would have given them the opportunity to invoke the emergency provisions of the Agreement in times of need to access essential medicines for their citizens. This was not to be the case, as the ground realities were difficult to manoeuvre and there were more impediments to invoking the flexibilities than originally perceived. This article will suggest that the best option available for sub-Saharan Africa is seeking an outright amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, as working within the parameters of the Agreement to achieve the goal of access to affordable medicines is not a viable option. It will also be argued that unless it acts urgently to seek the amendment it may be too late, as it could find itself left behind by both developing countries from other continents and patent-holding developed countries alike.

TI The Political Economy of Developing Country Antidumping Investigations
   against China
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB This article draws on industry-level data to analyze the political economy of the use of the antidumping statute by 10 less developed countries (LDCs) against China. Test results suggest that Chinese import competition is an important factor explaining the pattern of LDC antidumping initiation against China. Macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product growth rate also play some role in influencing the pattern of LDC antidumping determination against China. Importantly, statistical analyses did not yield any evidence suggesting that China's membership in the World Trade Organization has disciplined developing countries' use of the antidumping policy. The paper conjectures that China's Most-Favored-Nation status under the World Trade Organization, the designation of China as a nonmarket economy in antidumping investigations until 2016, and the retaliatory incentives generated by the growing deflection of Chinese exports to developing country markets may have overwhelmed the institutional effect of the trade organization in shaping the pattern of LDC antidumping decision making toward China.

TI Trade Liberalisation: The Effects of Free Trade Agreements on the
   Competitiveness of the Dairy Sector
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB In recent years, preferential trade agreements (PTAs), free trade agreements (FTAs) in particular, have proliferated while WTO negotiations have stagnated. This paper contributes to the literature on trade liberalisation and the agricultural sector by analysing the effects of FTAs on the competitiveness of the dairy sector across 76 countries and over a 20-year period from 1990 to 2009. With a longitudinal econometric model, the results demonstrate that when a country has a revealed comparative advantage in the dairy sector, FTAs positively influence several indicators of competitiveness in the dairy sector, such as production, market share and trade balance. The results also indicate that multilateral FTAs are more beneficial than bilateral FTAs. There is strong empirical evidence that FTAs are more beneficial to developed countries than to developing countries. There is no statistical evidence to support the hypothesis about a relationship between FTAs and farm-gate price.

TI Does Plant Variety Protection Contribute to Crop Productivity? Lessons
   for Developing Countries from US Wheat Breeding
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB The application of intellectual property rights (IP) in developing countries is and remains highly controversial, particularly as regards applications to food/agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, which have direct ramifications for large numbers of peoples. One dimension complicating a reasoned dialogue on the public benefits of IP, particularly when many developing countries are implementing the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as mandated by membership in the World Trade Organization, is a dearth of information on their actual operation and effects. In this study, we address one particular aspect of the limited documentation on the effects of IP systems, the effect of plant variety protection (PVP) on the genetic productivity potential of varieties. Specifically, we examine wheat varieties in Washington State, United States, which are produced by both public and private sector breeders. Results from the study show that implementation of PVP attracted private investment in open pollinated crops such as wheat in the United States and provided greater numbers of varieties of these crops, which are high yielding from both the public and private sectors. These results may provide some insights for policy makers from developing countries on the effects of IP for plants as their TRIPS commitments are being implemented.

SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
AB This paper tests empirically whether Aid-for-Trade has been working since its launch in the early 2000s. Using panel data consisting of 102 developing countries from 2002 to 2017, this paper finds that the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) initiative has been working conditionally. Specifically, AfT itself turns out to be effective in export promotion in developing countries, but more so only in a few countries with high growth rates. That is, AfT has greater effects in recipients with high state capacity and a sound economic environment. Additionally, the WTO-led AfT initiative, launched in 2005, has contributed to export promotion by aid recipients, indicating that more commitments from donor sides are essential for the effectiveness of AfT. These empirical findings are supported with evidence from the case of Vietnam, one of the largest recipients of both ODA and AfT, which illustrates the importance of the economic environment in which AfT initiative is implemented. Strategic economic policies implemented by the Vietnamese government have moved its centrally planned economy to a market-based economy, thus promoting integration with the global economy and creating a compatible environment for AfT.

TI Kicking away the financial ladder? German development banking under
   economic globalisation
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB While extensive literature exists on how economic globalisation has limited developing countries' policy space for industrial policy, the literature on how it has affected advanced economies remains scant. We utilise original archival material to analyse the activities of the German public development bank, the Kreditantstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), in order to shed light on an important, but neglected aspect of German industrial policy. We analyse how the KfW responded to multiple challenges after the rise of economic globalisation, including a funding crisis, international agreements to limit export subsidies and Europeanisation. We argue that KfW successfully managed to navigate these challenges in order to retain, and even increase, its ability to conduct selective industrial policy in the post-1980s era. This was possible because of Germany's hard currency and low sovereign credit risk, large market size, which was augmented by membership in the European Union, and Germany's position as regional hegemon within Europe. More broadly, this shows how, conditional on domestic politics, advanced economies are able to shape and exploit the rules of the international economic system to implement industrial policies to their advantage, even as developing countries are given the opposite policy recommendations.

TI From Preferential Trade Arrangements to Free Trade Agreements: One of
   the Downturns of Cooperation in International Relations?
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Since the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have been an interesting tool to promote international cooperation through the granting of non-reciprocal and/or unilateral tariff preferences by developed countries to developing countries. These international agreements have tended to generate critical trade dependencies for the receiving countries. Due to the circumstances of world trade and due to the lack of interest of the grantors to maintain this type of tariff preference, these developing countries are forced to renegotiate their PTAs into to free trade agreements (FTAs). To demonstrate this, we conducted a qualitative analysis to characterize the behavior of PTAs and their impact on the configuration of FTAs and to obtain indicators and trends. The results suggested a predominance of FTAs and a decline in PTAs. This was done to maintain access to the markets within those granting countries, which also became the main trading partners of these PTA recipient countries.

AB This paper critically explores the cases for and against the inclusion of core tabour standards in the World Trade Organization (WTO). First, it focuses on why the issue of social dumping has recently entered the public debate in advanced countries. It then analyzes the economic impact that the inclusion of such standards would have in both developed and developing countries, focusing specifically on its implications for child labor. The paper argues that the WTO is not the best institution to (teal with labor standards. Moreover, it explains why regulating this issue will directly damage developing countries growth and development prospects. Finally, it explores alternative solutions to deal with this global problem, both inside and outside the WTO.

TI Inequality in international trade? Developing countries and
   institutional change in WTO dispute settlement
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a controversial exercise in legalization at the international level, with direct implications for inequality between developed and developing countries. Conventional wisdom suggests that moves to establish binding, third-party arbitration in international law generally favor smaller, less powerful states. Nevertheless, many of the most pointed criticisms of the new WTO system and the most radical reform proposals have come from developing countries, its presumed beneficiaries. To unravel this paradox, I examine the role of the Appellate Body, which has become the principal engine of institutional change in the WTO system. Like all quasi-judicial actors, the Appellate Body has a certain level of delegated authority, especially over procedural issues. Despite objections from WTO members, the Appellate Body has brought about several significant procedural reforms. It has broadened the access of third parties in appellate proceedings; opened the door to amicus curiae submissions by private individuals and organizations; and endorsed the representation of governments by private counsel. In all three moves, the Appellate Body - whose legitimacy remains contested - generates information about the political context and potential consequences of its rulings. Its institutional interests, however, at times conflict with those of developing countries in the WTO, as these decisions on balance threaten to exacerbate existing inequalities, at least in the short term.

TI WTO remedies and developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse World Trade Organisation (WTO) remedies from a developing country perspective, with a view to suggest reforms in the system.
   Design/methodology/approach - WTO members' proposals for reforming WTO remedies and WTO cases are reviewed in order to determine the need for reforms and the nature of reforms to be undertaken.
   Findings - WTO remedies are unfavourable to developing countries, most of which are unable to utilise them due to their weaker economies as compared to their developed country counterparts. There is no consensus on the nature of reforms to be undertaken. This paper suggests the need to synthesise the current proposals and develop various workable models.
   Originality/value - This paper provides proposals which may improve WTO remedies for the benefit of developing countries, thereby not only strengthening the WTO enforcement mechanism but the multilateral trading system as a whole.

TI Crossing the river by feeling the stones: where the WTO is going after
   Seattle, Doha and Cancun
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB When we ask where the WTO is going after its debacle in Seattle its success in Doha, and the failure in Cancun, we find neither imminent collapse nor a new grand design. My analysis of the difference between these ministerial meetings separates the inter-linked themes of inadequate WTO procedure, the evolving trade policy agenda, and the changing role of developing countries. The first frame is the effort to make the institution stronger by improving internal and external transparency. The second frame is about the demands to deepen WTO disciplines in the era of globalization, when the meaning of liberalization moves from border measures to domestic regulations. The third frame is about making the WTO wider, where the context includes debates on the meaning of 'development'. After exploring these frames, and their implications for where the WTO is going, I speculate on what the Single Undertaking of the Doha round might contain. I use a metaphor to simplify a complex story about the difference between bargaining in incremental time and negotiating in conjunctural time: the WTO is 'crossing the river by feeling the stones'.

TI How Do Technical Barriers to Trade Influence Trade?
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper empirically estimates the trade effects of technical barriers to trade (TBT) based on all TBT notifications from 105 World Trade Organization (WTO) countries during 19952008. The paper adopts a modified two-stage gravity model to control for both sample selection bias and firm heterogeneity bias. It was found that a country's TBT notifications decrease other countries' probability of exporting, but increase their export volumes. The result can be explained by the TBT's differential effects on the fixed and variable cost of export, and consumer confidence. It was further found that (i) a developing country's TBT have significant effects on other developing countries' exports, but no significant effects on the developed countries' exports, (ii) a developed country's TBT have significant effects on the exports from both types of countries, and (iii) exports from developed countries are affected by a developed country's TBT more seriously than a developing country's TBT.

   1. Are the EU's actions in compliance with its own law and the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO)?
   2. What is the impact of these actions on international trade and on the EU's trading partners especially if they are developing countries?
   The most important consequence of this incident is its restrictive impact on international trade and/or the use of consumer protection as a tool for protectionism. In this particular incident, it does appear that the EU's actions could have been held to have violated WTO law had the Asian developing countries brought a case against the EU. The article will conclude by examining the impact of the EU's actions on its relations with Asia.

TI Services Trade Policies and Economic Integration: New Evidence for

SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB This paper applies machine learning to recreate to a high degree of accuracy the OECD's Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI) to provide quantitative evidence on the restrictiveness of services policies in 2016 for a sample of developing countries, using regulatory data collected by the World Bank and WTO. Resulting estimates are used to extend the OECD STRI approach to 23 additional countries, producing what we term a Services Policy Index (SPI). Converting the SPI to ad valorem equivalent terms shows that services policies are typically much more restrictive than tariffs on imports of goods, in particular in professional services and telecommunications. The SPI has strong explanatory power for bilateral trade in services at the sectoral level, as well as for aggregate goods and services trade.

TI Agricultural Liberalization in the Doha Round
SO GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL
AB Agriculture is an urgent and vital problem for developing countries, and even more so for the poorest countries that are often dependent on a very small set of commodities, many of which are highly subsidized and protected in the OECD countries. The Uruguay Round brought agriculture into the WTO legal framework, but did not lower the effective level of OECD farm protection after 1995 and granted many exceptions to WTO rules that reinforced agricultural protection. While there are a number of diverging forces that are potential sources of change in the levels and patterns of agricultural protection, the recent farm policies adopted by the U.S. and EU reflect an absence of significant domestic reform and appear to be going in the wrong direction.
   The analysis of agricultural liberalization reveals very large potential gains for both developed and developing countries that will come especially from own-country liberalization as well as from inter-country trade, significant benefits that may be realized by the poorest developing countries, and limited benefits from existing preferential agricultural arrangements. An ideal program for agricultural liberalization in the Doha Round would involve substantial reductions in the high tariffs that exist in both developed and developing countries using the Swiss formula approach and limiting exceptions and special and differential treatment, elimination of agricultural export subsidies, and making meaningful reductions in domestic supports. The negotiations should not get hung up on issues of food security and the effects of higher prices for low-income consumers, and a special safeguard for agriculture is not recommended. It is imperative that agricultural liberalization should be combined with appropriate domestic policies and actions and international assistance, if needed, to help finance emergency food inventories and aid to disadvantaged groups.

TI The politics of foreign direct investment into developing countries:
   Increasing FDI through international trade agreements?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB The flow of foreign direct investment into developing countries varies greatly across countries and over time. The political factors that affect these flows are not well understood. Focusing on the relationship between trade and investment, we argue that international trade agreements-GATT/WTO and preferential trade agreements (PTAs)-provide mechanisms for making commitments to foreign investors about the treatment of their assets, thus reassuring investors and increasing investment. These international commitments are more credible than domestic policy choices, because reneging on them is more costly. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2000 support this argument. Developing countries that belong to the WTO and participate in more PTAs experience greater FDI inflows than otherwise, controlling for many factors including domestic policy preferences and taking into account possible endogeneity. Joining international trade agreements allows developing countries to attract more FDI and thus increase economic growth.

TI Conflict and Reconciliation of International Genetically Modified Food

AB Genetically modified food gave rise to several controversies since it came into being. The clash of international GMF legislation is rooted in the divergence of the EU and the US legislation, which leads to the divergence of the WTO and Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and indirectly influences the legislative choice of developing countries. Like other developing countries, China also faces lots of challenges including lag in genetically modified organism technology, disadvantage caused by invisible private standard, technical control of GMO companies in developed countries and low level of involvement of the public. In recent years, China adopts its own policy on GMO by developing GM technology cautiously. The legislative situation in China fall far behind domestic research and commercial production necessity. China has revised several existing legislations. Although there is far from perfect, it makes great progress. In the future, China is expected to be more active, positive and open towards GMO.

TI Developing Countries' Pursuit of an Intellectual Property Law Balance
   under the WTO TRIPS Agreement
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Progressive and steady technological advancement in developing countries has generated serious debate whether government discretion to manoeuvre IP laws is unduly curbed by the ever-increasing and fragmented international regulatory regime. The global regime has expanded from WIPO conventions to TRIPS at the WTO, and to a myriad of regional and bilateral agreements stipulating TRIPS-plus standards. The way that a harmonized IP fashion operates affects internal decisions in striking a proper balance between incentives to create and those to promote dynamic competition. For developing countries, the ultimate goal is to transform to a knowledge-based and innovative economy. In this regard, the TRIPS "balance" objective is ambiguously formulated and hence cannot be actively considered by WTO panels. Secondly, conditions in the individual exceptions are so restrictively applied that governments are set back from devising innovative exceptions to balance their obligatory commitments. To maximize the use of TRIPS leeway for technological development schemes, both deficiencies need to be managed by a balance-oriented initiative taken by the WTO judicial and/or legislative bodies.

TI New Protagonists in Global Economic Governance: Brazilian Agribusiness
   at the WTO
SO NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The existing international economic order has been heavily shaped by US power and the US has been a key driver of globalisation and neoliberal economic restructuring, prompting speculation about whether the rise of new developing country powers could rupture the current trajectory of neoliberal globalisation. This paper analyses the case of Brazil at the World Trade Organization (WTO), a core institution in global economic governance. In the last decade, Brazil successfully waged two landmark trade disputes against the US and EU and created a coalition of developing countries - the G20 - which brought an end to the dominance of the US and EU at the WTO and made their trade policies a central target of the Doha Round. Brazil's activism has been widely hailed as a major victory for developing countries. However, I argue that rather than challenging the neoliberal agenda of the WTO, Brazil has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of free market globalisation and the push to expand and liberalise global markets. I show that Brazil's stance has been driven by the rise of its export-oriented agribusiness sector. This case demonstrates that business actors from the Global South are becoming significant new protagonists in global economic governance; they are taking the tools created by the states and corporations of the Global North - in this case, the WTO and its neoliberal discourse - and turning them against their originators. At the same time, their interests are being wrapped in and advanced through a discourse of development and social justice and a strategic mobilisation of the politics of the North-South divide.

The Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) serves as an important forum for trade-related issues among member countries. This study reviews the main food safety regulations currently prevailing in international trade, and examines food safety-related issues raised by member countries. Developed countries have engaged the mechanism for some time, but developing countries have started to use it only recently. The results of this study have several important implications for policymakers and stakeholders with regard to global trade issues. The long duration of the process and lack of regional representation highlight the importance of empowering the capacity of developing countries in terms of legal aspects.

TI The Quest for Accountable Governance: Embedded NGOs and Demand Driven
   Advocacy in the International Trade Regime
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The ongoing failure of the multilateral trade regime to deliver on global development priorities has produced a new brand of expert. Embedded NGOs have emerged with the expressed aim to socially embed global markets, carve out additional policy or development space for developing countries, increase their negotiating capacity, and promote the three pillars of sustainable development economic, social and environment. Eschewing conventional advocacy or protest work that challenges received wisdom, Embedded NGOs leverage their legal and technical trade-related expertise across a range of issue areas that are of primary concern to poor countries. This article develops a conceptual framework for analysing the impact of Embedded NGOs on the World Trade Organization's (WTO) accountability regime. While Embedded NGOs show good prospects for improving the inclusion and negotiating capacity of developing countries, the institutional and geographical attributes of Embedded NGOs, the uneven engagement by Embedded NGOs with developing countries, their commitment to a liberal economic order, and the internal and external accountability of Embedded NGOs themselves serve to reinforce dominant trade narratives and power asymmetries in global trade.

TI How does TRIPs compliance affect the economic growth of developing
   countries? Application of the Synthetic Control method
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper examines the effects of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on the economic growth of countries, with special attention to developing countries. We examine both the strength of countries' IPRs, as well as their compliance with the 1995 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of the World Trade Organization. Our theoretical framework is a growth model which distinguishes capital as physical capital, human capital and intellectual property. Our methods include panel regression techniques, plus a novel Synthetic Control method. The latter is valuable for examining policy effects in research situations where data are limited to small sample sizes; and where reverse causality and heterogeneity are concerns. The Synthetic Control method allows us to assess the impact of TRIPs compliance on economic growth relative to a counterfactual of what would have occurred in the absence of compliance. The results show that while select developing countries experience growth benefits from complying with the TRIPs agreement, others do not, supporting the notion that there is a wide range of heterogeneity in the effects of IPR reforms on growth. These findings are robust when we account for marginal institutional changes in IPRs, enforcement of IPRs, and technological capacity in developing countries.

This is considered in relation to fisheries access agreements in the Central and Western Pacific where several least developed but resource rich island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu are highly exposed to the risks associated with new WTO fisheries subsidies disciplines that do not consider their particular vulnerabilities. The paper considers some of the issues that coastal developing countries should incorporate into their emerging negotiating positions at the WTO. State-to-Sate fisheries access agreements which are often highly subsidised but where fishing vessel owners pay the equivalent of lump sum tax are paradoxically, the least distortionary and damaging to the environment. Strategies for managing the possible new disciplines are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Rule power or power rules?: State behaviour after the reform of the
   GATT/WTO dispute settlement mechanism
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB The author explores whether the reform of the GATT/WTO dispute settlement mechanism in 1995 has led to changes in the behaviour of the members in trade disputes. He concludes that there has been a change from a power-oriented behaviour towards a more rule-oriented one. The number of disputes has increased in spite of a low conflict level, and this can by far be explained by the rise in the number of members and rules. The members have so far tended to implement within a reasonable period of time the recommendations and rulings by the Dispute Settlement Council of the WTO. This was not the case in the past. After 1995, the members tend to avoid unilateralism, and weaker states are able to make the stronger states change policies after complaints.
   Power and rules are by no means opposite elements in a GATT/ WTO context. The rules that affect behaviour have not come into existence in a power vacuum. They have developed through strategic exercise of power. Through the dispute settlement mechanism reform, strong states have secured legitimacy for their pressure on developing countries to lower trade barriers. Developing countries that are able to utilise the mechanism at all, have secured a more level playing-field in their disputes with stronger counterparts.

TI King cotton, developing countries and the 'peace clause': The WTO's US
   Cotton Subsidies decision
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Although the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a powerful vehicle for promoting economic development, the Uruguay Round has been perceived by developing country WTO members as an unequal bargain. Especially with respect to agriculture, the Uruguay Round yielded only limited concessions. In September 2003, Doha Round efforts stalled at Cancun when developing countries coalesced to oppose a proposal that insufficiently liberalized trade in agriculture. In March 2005, the Dispute Settlement Body adopted a panel decision upholding Brazil's legal challenge of US subsidies to cotton producers. The US Cotton Subsidies decision represents a dramatic victory for Brazil and other developing country WTO members. The timing of the decision, coinciding with ongoing Doha Round agriculture negotiations, ensures that it will influence any outcome of the Round. This article examines the US Cotton Subsidies decision, describes the subsidy programs at issue in the dispute, reviews applicable WTO rules, and outlines the major findings of the panel and Appellate Body. The article concludes that Brazil's victory in US Cotton Subsidies may represent a broader shift within the WTO away from a system dominated by the US and EC toward a system that increasingly is influenced by emerging market economies.

TI Pollution Policy and Trade Liberalization of Environmental Goods
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB During the Doha Round at the World Trade Organization, reductions in trade barriers on environmental goods (EG) were put forward as a means of helping developed and developing countries alike deal with current environmental problems. We examine the potential effectiveness of such a strategy in a developing country that imports all its consumption of EG from an imperfectly competitive foreign eco-industry. We point out that trade liberalization of EG might in fact lead to less stringent pollution taxes, which can result in an actual rise in pollution levels. We then show that the environmental effectiveness objective of this trade reform can be achieved when the regulator uses quantitative abatement standards as an alternative pollution policy instrument. However, this environmental achievement comes at the expense of social welfare.

TI Multilateral talks on transparency in government procurement: Concerns
   for developing countries
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB While a transparent and efficient system of government procurement is developmentally desirable, it does not necessarily follow that a multilateral agreement is' required. At present, there are three WTO fora concerned with procurement and they have different agendas. Some deal with opening procurement markets to trade, others with transparency. A focus on "transparency" rather than "market opening" poses fewer problems for developing countries, but raises the question of whether compliance would be worth the (potentially substantial) cost. Moreover, the fear is that any architecture established under the banner of "transparency" will then provide the foundation for more ambitious subsequent negotiations on market opening. Market opening offers the potential gains of cheaper domestic procurement and improved access to other countries' markets. But the first of these can be achieved through domestic reform, and the principal constraints on developing country exports do not require a WTO agreement. Taking the example of the South African construction industry, the most direct way to improve export potential would be for donors to untie aid procurement.

TI Anti-dumping and market access: A note
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB For the duration of the currently stalled round of trade negotiations (the Doha Development Round) attention focused on the plight of developing countries under the current trade rules. One of the aspects under discussion is market access, and in particular the (ab)use of anti-dumping measures to limit market access so that the progress made towards trade liberalisation is eroded. A popular assertion is that developed countries use anti-dumping measures to protect their own industries against competition from developing countries. Part I of this short research note briefly takes stock of developments in this regard since the inception of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995. How has the use of anti-dumping (AD) measures evolved? Who are the most active initiators of AD investigations and who are the victims? What is the spread between initiations of AD investigations and the actual imposition of AD measures? In Part II we consider selected AD issues, such as the determination of dumping margins and injury, administrative discretion, and the longevity of AD decrees.

TI Declining Indian Agricultural Trade in an Unequal World: A Perspective
SO GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB The Uruguay Round established rules that were expected to improve market access for agricultural products and reduced export subsidies and domestic support payments as an opportunity to level the playing field. Major global economic benefits were predicted from the establishment of WTO and Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). But what has happened since the Uruguay Round? Industrialized countries systematically use subsidies to skew the benefits of agricultural trade in their favour. The overall level of support to agriculture in these countries has fallen very little. What does free trade mean in a context where the world's largest exporter of dairy produce, the EU, is providing subsidies in excess of US $300 billion a year? India is the number one producer of milk and yet cannot compete. The European Union and the United States have invented a category of support-known as the Green Box and the Blue Box in WTO talks-deemed to be decoupled from production and therefore exempt from cuts in subsidies. The persistence of high trade barriers as well as regulatory controls related to food safety and environment make trade rules unfair. The overall feeling is that AoA is an 'unequal treaty' as high support continues in OECD countries. There is no level playing field. Agricultural surpluses in rich countries, generated through protection and subsidies and then dumped onto world markets, have hurt agricultural development in developing countries. Developing countries as a whole are projected to increase their net imports of cereals for all purposes to a total of more than 200 million tonnes of net annual imports from the developed countries by 2020. Developing countries like India will become net agricultural importers. It is argued that the Uruguay Round agreements did not go far enough in reducing trade barriers in developed countries, to have a significant impact. It did, however, establish a framework for negotiating further reductions in support. The Doha Round offers the opportunity to level a tilted playing field. Equally important is India improving its own agricultural policies. For years we have discriminated against agriculture.

TI Exploring Aggressive Legalism: Is Now A Good Time to Promote This
   Approach in Greater Asia?
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB Aggressive legalism, a trade policy-making strategy targeted at actively utilizing WTO rules to defend trade interests, has greatly benefited major Eastern Asian countries in past years. This paper examines whether this strategy should be promoted around greater Asia in this era. First, this paper updates the status of adoption of aggressive legalism in East Asian countries including Japan, Korea and China. Second, it looks into the current and possible future utilization of the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism by selected countries which are frequent "targets" of trade remedy measures, namely India, Thailand and Indonesia. Finally, it discusses the participation of Asian developing countries in the WTO. Relying upon case studies and statistical analysis, the author finds that Asian countries' rising image in international trade signals a trend of adopting aggressive legalism in Great Asia. This trend will undoubtedly promote the energetic development of international trade globally. However, room for more progressive participation in the WTO still exists, especially in developing countries.

SO REVISTA VIRTUAL UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DEL NORTE
AB This article analyzes the different manners in which the procedure of the Dispute Settlement System (DSS) of WTO creates difficulties for a better and greater access of developing countries. The article is based on the analysis of both formal and empirical information about the DSS procedure, and proposes that some factors have enabled rich countries to maintain standards that are contrary to the covered agreements without fear of being forced to compensate the damages caused to the economies of developing countries. Among these factors we have: the flexibility of the consultation phase in which negotiators resolve most of the disputes regardless of unequal conditions between countries; in certain cases, the reversion of the burden of proof which affects the cost of the process; the freedom of proof which makes its contribution at the end of the procedure; and the inability to obtain a cash payment for violations of trade rules. All of the above affects the quality of the access of developing countries to the settlement of commercial disputes.

SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB Since the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures was established, risk analysis in trade, and ultimately in Veterinary and Animal Health Services, has become strategically important.
   Irrespective of their concept (discipline, approach, method, process), all types of risk analysis in trade involve four periods or phases:
   risk identification
   risk assessment
   risk management
   risk information or communication.
   All veterinarians involved in a risk analysis unit must have in-depth knowledge of statistics and the epidemiology of transmissible diseases, as well as a basic knowledge of veterinary science, economics, mathematics, data processing and social communication, to enable them to work with professionals in these disciplines.
   Many developing countries do not have enough well-qualified professionnals in these areas to support a risk analysis unit. This will need to be rectified by seeking strategic alliances with other public or private sectors that will provide the required support to run the unit properly.
   Due to the special nature of its risk analysis functions, its role in supporting decision-making, and the criteria of independence and transparency that are so crucial to its operations, the hierarchical position of the risk analysis unit should be close to the top management of the Veterinary Service.
   Due to the shortage of personnel in developing countries with the required training and scientific and technical qualifications, countries with organisations responsible for both animal and plant health protection would be advised to set up integrated plant and animal risk analysis units. In addition, these units could take charge of all activities relating to WTO agreements and regional agreements on animal and plant health management.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB This article identifies Professor's Jackson philosophies which permeated the "development aspect" of WTO Law. Firstly, it illustrates that throughout, he influenced the WTO legal framework. Specifically, he inspired GATT Contracting Parties in the establishment of the WTO's institutional structure. His motivation was to improve the accuracy of the GATT rules applicable to developing countries. One of his most prevalent innovative strategies included a rule-based WTO dispute settlement system. In the Doha Development Agenda, he recommended the modification of the decision-making process with the objective of enhancing the participation of developing and LDC Members.
   Secondly, Prof. Jackson educated fellows, therefore pioneering the development of new WTO experts. Under his directorship, a new vigorous platform comprising researchers was founded, namely, the Institute of International of Economic Law (IIEL). Amongst them were world prominent professors from the Editorial Board of the Journal of International Economic Law (JIEL); International students and editorial assistants. Prof. Jackson also included professionals from developing countries and LDCs, thereby increasing capacities for integration of their respective countries into the WTO community. His annual conferences which were hosted in Washington D.C. and London were attended by lawyers, diplomats and economists, amongst others. These conferences remain, and serve as a reminder of the legacy that he created.

SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB Why and when do developing countries file trade disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO)? Although financial conditions have long been considered an important driver of trade policy, they have been largely absent from the literature on trade disputes. We argue that developing country governments bring more trade dispute to the WTO when overvalued real exchange rates put exporters at a competitive disadvantage. This dynamic is most prevalent in countries where large foreign currency debt burdens discourage nominal currency devaluations that would otherwise serve exporters' interests. Our findings provide an explanation for differences in dispute participation rates among developing countries, and also suggest a new link between exchange rate regimes and trade policy.

TI Soaring antiretroviral prices, TRIPS and TRIPS flexibilities: a burning
   issue for antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries
SO CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS
AB Purpose of review
   The achievement of significant reductions in the price of antiretroviral drugs constitutes one of the main economic pillars of antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries. Today this economic pillar is threatened.
   Recent findings
   The prohibitive prices of newer first-line and second-line regimens have created a watershed in relation to the prices of earlier first-line treatments. These price increases are closely related to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) that imposes an important barrier to generic competition. Intellectual property flexibilities foreseen by the TRIPS agreement allow the manufacture and supply of affordable generic versions of new generations of antiretroviral under certain conditions. However, the capacity to supply a specified list of generics under such conditions is tight and the utilization of such flexibilities in their current form remains complex and unattractive.
   Summary
   The TRIPS agreement currently constitutes a significant barrier to providing access to new antiretroviral at affordable prices in developing countries. If the debate on initiatives for increased flexibility of intellectual property rights does not become more extensive or obtain the overwhelming support of the international community, serious consequences are to be expected in terms of the fight against AIDS in most of the developing countries.

TI Understanding developing country resistance to the Doha Round
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The Doha Round negotiations at the World Trade Organization have come to a halt. The vast majority of analyses of the (at least temporary) demise of the Doha Round have focused on the lack of the United States and the European Union to reach consensus on the agricultural proposals that were tabled during the round. Relatively little attention has focused on explaining the rationale for why a large part of the developing world would not agree to proposals on the table as well. Many developing country negotiators claim that the potential benefits of the Doha Round were relatively small while the potential costs in terms of a loss of sovereignty to deploy effective development policies were significant. This paper argues that developing countries took a respite from the negotiations because the possible gains from market access were not large enough to trade for giving up domestic policy space for development policy.

TI The Green Dilemma about Liberalization of Trade in Environmental Goods
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Environmental goods are a key element of the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Conventional wisdom argues that trade liberalization of environmental goods is crucial in the sustainable economic development process as it sustains potential benefits for promoting environmental protection and economic development. For many, the ongoing WTO Doha negotiations represent an opportunity to enhance the mutual supportiveness of trade and enviromnent. However, as this article shows, the policy choice for most developing countries is not so clear-cut. The truth is that most of them might not be better off with ambitious trade liberalization in this sector. This article attempts to answer if trade liberalization in environmental goods helps developing countries. If so, which trade liberalization policy would serve in best interest of Os well as benefit these as well as benefit of these countries. Lastly, this article also looks at various scenarios of environmental goods liberalization in the context of the ongoing proposals on the WTO negotiating table and tries to assess how they measure up against the development objectives of the negotiations.

TI THE OSTENSIBLE 'FLEXIBILITIES' IN TRIPS: CAN ESSENTIAL PHARMACEUTICALS
   BE EXCLUDED FROM PATENTABILITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES?
SO MONASH UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
AB The requirement that a country sign up to the complete package of WTO agreements in order to join the organization has been problematic for developing countries, entailing institutional reforms which are arguably illsuited to their needs; particularly those of the least developed members. The WTO has emphasised that the Sflexibilities' provided by the compulsory licensing provisions in TRIPS allow developing countries to determine their own national health policies and access essential pharmaceuticals. While political attention currently focuses on compulsory licensing under TRIPS, this article examines the art 27(2) of TRIPS, which allows members to exclude inventions from patentability if certain criteria are met. The article argues the approach of future dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body will be shaped by jurisprudence on both GATT's exception provision and the European Patent Convention. This jurisprudence shows that a very high threshold must be met in order to invoke unilateral trade restrictions or exclude an invention from patentability. This means it is likely that developing countries would have significant difficulty invoking art 27(2) of TRIPS to exclude certain pharmaceuticals from patentability in order to enable affordable access for those affected by diseases such as HIV-AIDS.

AB As a WTO member, China always insists that it is a developing country. But China' true interests in the WTO not only have something in common with other developing countries, but also have differences between. The starting and stand points in all issues should be its own economic interests. Only in this process of diluting "developing country" status, China's position in the World Trade Organization could be clarified. Since the WTO system itself is the product of the conflict, coordination and exchange of the interests among the members of the WTO and is not the sacrosanct system of the highest standard, China should make changes from strictly abiding by the rules and regulations to pragmatically carrying out rules and regulations. And China should transform its mode from complying with WTO rules to affecting WTO rules.

TI Domestic political competition and pro-cyclical import protection
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Governments, especially in developing countries, routinely practice binding overhang (i.e. setting applied tariffs below binding WTO commitments) and frequently move applied tariffs for given products up and down over the business cycle. Moreover, applied tariffs are pro-cyclical in developing countries. We explain this phenomenon using a dynamic theory of lobbying between domestic interest groups. Applied tariffs are pro-cyclical when high-tariff interests (e.g. import-competing industries) capture the government: these groups concede lower tariffs to low-tariff interest groups (e.g. exporting firms or firms using imported intermediate inputs) during recessions because recessions lower the opportunity cost of lobbying and thereby generate a stronger lobbying threat.

TI A General Agreement on Higher Education: GATS, globalization, and
   imperialism
SO RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB Through successive rounds of negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) encourages countries to commit their higher education system to the mandates of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The WTO is an organization committed to the aggressive trade liberalization of services like higher education. This ideology, known as neoliberalism (Apple, 2005) is redefining the role of higher education. Through critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 2003), three genres of documents have been analyzed in search of the ideology and power relations imbedded in the texts. These genres include informational documents, the legal text of GATS, and proposals from the USA, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan calling for the reduction of trade barriers in higher education. The relationship between the developed countries who are calling for a reduction in trade barriers and developing countries who are struggling to provide public education could be further strained through an international set of trade rules like GATS. Language and text can create, shift, or maintain ideologies. In the case of GATS, the ideology reflects a new imperialism where more powerful countries retain developing countries as markets in which they continue to rule intellectually.

TI Developing countries in international negotiations: How they influence
   trade and climate change negotiations
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Developing countries have become convinced that trade can have significant effects on their total income and on their development. Most believe that the effects of climate change will be particularly damaging to poor countries, while some of the measures proposed to mitigate it could provide significant financial benefits. Although they are not the most important or direct policy instruments against poverty, the outcomes of trade and climate change negotiations matter. Therefore, countries have started to participate. Participation works best where they have most experience, where they have the broadest range of allies, and where they are not handicapped by aid dependency. Some can point to achievements. Some countries made gains on agriculture and textiles in the Uruguay Round. Since then, some have succeeded in blocking unwelcome initiatives and putting their issues forward. But the World Trade Organization (WTO) and climate change institutions have not yet been changed to be appropriate for more players with more complex interests.

TI Analysis of TRIPS Agreement and the justification of international IP
   rights protection in the WTO's multilateral trading system, with
   particular reference to pharmaceutical patents
SO INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW
AB The entry of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement has seen the developing countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) suffer from the excessive burden of obligations imposed under the Agreement to embrace and implement a higher standard of intellectual property (IP) protection. One of the areas where the impact of the measures is most felt is on accessibility to affordable medicines for frontline treatment of diseases in developing countries and LDCs, where the majority of the HIV/AIDS sufferers come from. This inevitable plight, although well known, and posited by the developing countries and LDCs during the Uruguay round of negotiations, was overlooked. This also necessitated the Doha Deceleration, which does not seem to have addressed the problem. The developed countries have also successfully utilised the TRIPS Agreement's IP rights protection criteria as a benchmark, to develop a much higher IP rights protection agenda through the introduction of TRIPS-plus provisions in bilateral and other multilateral agreements entered into with developing countries. The winners in the game are the patent-holding pharmaceutical corporations, software corporations, media corporations, and the developed countries where they are incorporated. The ones at the receiving end are the developing countries and the LDCs who were promised technology transfer to build a modern economy by the developed countries, but are faced with multiple problems of non-availability of affordable medicines for health care, besides others. This article seeks to study the justification for an extended IP rights protection under the TRIPS Agreement through an analysis of the philosophical underpinnings of the IP rights and the patent regime. It will be argued that the TRIPS Agreement is a major obstacle that the developing countries and the LDCs have been made to face as Members of the WTO (World Trade Organisation), with no end in sight for their miseries, and that the only possible solution is a review or an amendment of the TRIPS Agreement.

TI David Ricardo's Comparative Advantage and Developing Countries: Myth and
   Reality
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB This article examines David Ricardo's trade theory, which emphasises that if protection is removed, resources would be expected to move away from high cost to low-cost products and as a result productivity would rise. His comparative advantage trade theory advocates in favour of a free trade, the argument implied generally to defend laissez faire. This study discusses the mainstream arguments relating to static and dynamic gains from trade liberalisation which seem to be based on weak theoretical and empirical grounds. It will also briefly discuss free trade and its impact on the industrial and agricultural sectors and how the performance of both sectors could have a long-term impact on local industrialisation, food security, employment and well-being of the people in developing countries. This article builds on this political economy and looks in particular at free trade policies and their impact on the economies of developing countries. Free trade theory, which has wide support among international financial institutions, namely, the IMF (International Monetary Fund), World Bank, WTO (World Trade Organisation) draws on David Ricardo's theory. The study has found that free trade policy will deepen further the process of uneven development and unequal exchange.

TI The Importance of Global Value Chains in Developing Countries'
   Agricultural Trade Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The role of global value-added chains is growing in international trade. The development gap between highly developed economies and developing countries means that the only products with which less developed economies can compete on the international arena are agricultural products. Moreover, integration into global value-added chains is an important factor in achieving comparative advantages in trade and improving export competitiveness. The main aim of this article is to assess the impact of integration within global value chains on changes in the comparative advantage of developing countries in the global agricultural trade. The degree of participation of developing countries in global value chains (GVC) was assessed using data from the Trade in Value-added OECD-WTO database (November 2021 edition) by calculating domestic (DVA), foreign value-added (FVA), and revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indexes. The analysis covers the period 1995-2018 and 28 developing economies. The research showed that the foreign value added in the gross exports of agricultural commodities of developing countries was an important factor in strengthening their export position and the importance of integration within global value chains rises with increasing product complexity. In agricultural production, FVA in most developing countries does not have a significant impact on the shaping of the comparative advantage.

TI Revisiting African States Participation in the WTO Dispute Settlement
   through Intra-Africa RTA Dispute Settlement
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Whereas developed countries were the main players in the GATT dispute settlement mechanism, the era of the WTO saw a sharp increase in the developing countries' participation in trade disputes. Thus, developing countries are active complainants and defendants in the WTO dispute settlement processes. Nevertheless, African states are still marginalised, and this situation has attracted attention of many scholars. As a result, scholars in the field have come up with many reasons to explain why African states do not appear as either complainants or respondents. The reasons for Africa's non-participation have been argued to include cost of WTO litigation relative to the gains, low trade volumes, legal knowledge and non-integration of African countries in the WTO system. This article seeks to contribute to the existing literature on Africa's non-participation in the WTO dispute settlement. The goal in this article is to confirm or dispel assumptions that African states have interests that they need to safeguard through dispute settlement but are inhibited from doing so because of the reasons mentioned above. Unlike other studies, the determination on Africa's non-participation in the WTO dispute settlement will be approached from African states' participation in intra-Africa RTA dispute settlement mechanisms. While there are six intra-Africa RTAs notified to the WTO, this work focuses on only two - East African Community and Southern Africa Development Community.

SP World Trade Org
HO George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs
AB In this paper, we examine the theoretical rationale for WTO rules on the special and differential treatment (SDT) of developing countries. We describe a model of bilateral trade between a small country and a large trading partner, in which the small country suffers from a domestic commitment problem in trade policy. This problem arises because investors in the import-competing sector lobby the government to enact and maintain protectionist policies. We show that a reciprocal trade agreement, in which the large country lowers its tariffs conditionally on the small country doing the same, creates a carrot and stick' mechanisms that helps the small country to overcome its commitment problem. If capacity in the import-competing sector can only be reduced gradually, the agreement may need to allow the small country to delay the implementation of its trade liberalization commitments, in line with SDT provisions in the WTO. Our analysis suggests that, if reconciled with the principle of reciprocity, SDT can help developing countries to liberalize and improve their trading prospects.

This article examines the political-economic causes of the failure to challenge poor countries and discusses the static and dynamic costs and externality implications of this failure. Given the weak incentives to enforce WTO rules and disciplines against small and poor Members, bolstering the transparency function of the WTO is important to make trade agreements more relevant to trade constituencies in developing countries.

This article analyzes the tariff reduction modality it) NAMA in light of the basic principle of less than fill reciprocity in reduction commitments that has beets recognized as an integral component of NAMA negotiations in the Doha ministerial declaration, the Get-feral Council decision of I August 2004 and the Hong Kong Declaration. The article interprets less than full reciprocity in the MAMA negotiations and discusses the deferent tariff reduction formulas that could be used to fulfil the mandate of less than fill reciprocity. It also provides a critique of the proposed tariff reduction modality given in the NAMA document issued on 8 February 2008. The article shows that the proposed tariff reduction modality with the proposed set of coefficients for developed and developing countries will fail in honouring the less than fill reciprocity principle in reduction commitments.

HO World Trade Inst
AB The TRIPS Agreement emerged from the Uruguay Round negotiations as one of the three pillars of the WTO. This article offers a preliminary assessment of the first ten years under the TRIPS Agreement. Based on that assessment, it makes suggestions for the future.
   The objective of the principal developed country demandeurs of the TRIPS Agreement was to increase information and technology rent payments from developing countries. Incomplete implementation and enforcement was anticipated. Taking this into account, the Agreement has resulted in a substantial transformation of legal infrastructure in developing countries and has increased rent payment outflows to the owners of intellectual property (IP) rights. From this standpoint, the TRIPS Agreement has been successful in accomplishing its objectives.
   From the standpoint of developing countries, it is more difficult to identify positive effects. China is the major developing country success story of the past decade, and it has achieved its historic accomplishments in the face of intensive criticism of its IP regime. The TRIPS Agreement has come under harsh public scrutiny for the role attributed to it by the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa, ultimately leading to the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. As a consequence of a somewhat more balanced approach to TRIPS now achieved at the WTO, the United States in particular has shifted to bilateral and regional fora to obtain higher standards of protection and enforcement, calling into question the relevance of TRIPS Council deliberations.
   This article makes several recommendations. First, that new agreements concerning IP rights be subject to objective prior impact assessment. Second, that WTO Members give greater recognition to the fact that IP rules have significantly different public welfare implications depending on their field of application and the level of development of the implementing country. As the TRIPS Agreement transition periods have largely expired, the manner by which the TRIPS Council assesses its rules and makes provision for TRIPS-plus and TRIPS-minus adjustments might be restructured along industrial subject matter and developmental lines, taking better account of the impact-in-fact of IP rules on societies.
   In June 2004 a group of trade specialists was brought together at the World Trade Forum in Berne in a 'preliminary stocktaking' exercise to assess the first ten years of the World Trade Organization.1 This article was prepared for that occasion and addresses the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the 'TRIPS Agreement') on its ten-year anniversary.

TI The World Trade Organization and competition policy: Implications for
   developing countries
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB There exists a strong development case for countries to have effective competition policies, but the justification for a multilateral agreement depends upon answers to three questions. Why should countries not be left free to decide the sort of competition policy they want? Does a multilateral agreement to deal with these have advantages over bilateral accords? And what form should any WTO code take? There is plenty of evidence on the first question that companies exploit gaps in the coverage of competition policy (often with the connivance if not support of their host government). Bilateral agreements are spreading, and have a role to play, but it is probably unrealistic to expect them to provide a full solution. Hence, there is scope for a multilateral agreement, but uncertainty as to its political feasibility. The industrialised countries are mainly concerned to outlaw non-competitive behaviour that forms a non-tariff barrier to their exports. Developing countries are more interested in rules that would curb the anti-competitive activities of foreign firms (e.g., by outlawing export cartels). While there appears to be a stand-off, a close analysis of the stated positions of the EU and India suggests that there could be room for compromise.

TI International Governance on Carbon Tariff and Its Vacuum in
   International Regime
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Drawing on the idea that countries are eligible to implement differentiated emission reduction policies based on their respective capabilities, some parties of UNFCCC attempt to weaken the principle of "Common but differentiated responsibilities(CBDR)" and impose carbon tariff on international trade. This initiative is in fact another camouflage to burden developing countries with emission cut obligation, which has no doubt undermined the development rights of developing countries. This paper defines Carbon Tariff as border measures that target import goods with embodied carbon emission. It can be import tariffs or other domestic tax measures that adjust border tax, which includes plain import tariffs and export rebates, border tax adjustment, emission quota and permit etc. For some developed countries, carbon tariffs mean to sever trade protectionism and to build trade barriers. Its theoretical arguments like "loss of comparative advantage", "carbon leakage decreases environmental effectiveness" and "theoretical model bases" are pseudo-propositions without international consensus. Carbon tariff has become an intensively debated issue due to its duality of climate change and trade, but neither UNFCCC nor WTO has clarified this issue or has indicated a clear statement in this regard. As a result, it allows some parties to take advantage of this loophole and escape its international climate change obligation. Carbon tariff is an issue arising from global climate governance. To promote the cooperation of global climate governance and safeguard the social and economic development of developing countries, a fair and justified climate change regime and international trade institution should be established, and the settlement of the carbon tariff issue should be addressed within these frameworks. This paper argues that the international governance of carbon tariff should in cooperation with other international agreements; however, principles and guidelines regarding this issue should be developed under the UNFCCC. Based on these principles and guidelines, WTO can develop related technical operation provisions.

TI Patents and pills, power and procedure: The North-South politics of
   public health in the WTO
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Developing countries have limited control over the distributional and substantive dimensions of international institutions, but they retain an important stake in a rule-based international order that can reduce uncertainty and stabilize expectations. Because international institutions can provide small states with a potential mechanism to bind more powerful states to mutually recognized rules, developing countries may seek to strengthen the procedural dimensions of multilateral institutions. Clear and strong multilateral rules cannot substitute for weakness, but they can help ameliorate some of the vulnerability that is a product of developing countries' position in the international system. This article uses the contemporary international politics of intellectual property rights (IPRs) as a lens to examine North-South conflicts over international economic governance and the possibilities of institutional reform. Lacking the power to revise the substance of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), developing countries, allied with a network of international public health activists, subsequently designed strategies to operate within the constraining international political reality they faced. They sought to clarify the rules of international patent law, to affirm the rights established during the TRIPS negotiations, and to minimize vulnerability to opportunism by powerful states. In doing so the developing countries reinforced global governance in IPRs.

TI An exploration of green supply chain practices and performances in an
   automotive industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB During recent years, the natural environment has become a challenging topic that business organizations must consider due to the economic and ecological impacts and increasing awareness of environment protection. Globalization and the increased number of countries entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) have promoted green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in manufacturing organizations. GSCM has emerged as an important organizational philosophy and a proactive approach to reduce environmental risks. Increasing pressures such as stricter regulations, increased community, and consumer pressures, and the developing country's aim to enter the WTO have caused automotive supply chain managers to consider and to implement GSCM practices to improve both their economic and environmental performances. This paper explores the practices and performances of the GSCM based on the GSCM literature, and it considers the relationship between green supply chain practices (initiatives) and performance outcomes. In this paper, two questionnaires were developed and a survey conducted to assess the importance of GSCM practices and performances in an automotive company in a developing country using a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making method. The result of this paper presents practical guidance for managers in performing GSCM practices by ranking GSCM practices according to their importance which leads to improving GSCM performances.

TI STRIKING CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW
   FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SO FRONTIERS OF LAW IN CHINA
AB The fragmentation of international investment law into bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and other international investment agreements (IIAs) made it impossible as a system of law. In addition, the potential for inconsistent and conflicting decisions (especially against developing countries) in investment treaty arbitrations are abundant. The causes of this situation are two-fold and concern both substantive law and procedural law. Concerning the substance, the fragmentation of sources of international investment law plays a significant role in disaggregating coherence. Due to the large number of BITs, a state measure might be assessed differently under the two existing investment treaties, with each treaty specifying different standards of investment protection, even varying with the nationality of the investor affected. Inconsistent decisions can also result from the possibility of having multiple proceedings, in the same or different form, relating to an identical set of facts that can arise from independent claims. For developing countries, who face investment law disputes more frequently than developed countries, an ideal solution would be a global investment treaty or a plurilateral investment agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and use its dispute settlement system to resolve investment disputes.

TI Making COVID-19 mRNA vaccines accessible: challenges resolved
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES
AB Introduction The rapid spread of SARS-CoV2 infection allowed testing of mRNA vaccines that translate the target antigen, unlike introducing antigens in traditional vaccines. It proved safer and more effective and, as a chemical vaccine, much easier to develop and manufacture. Areas covered The science and technology behind the mRNA vaccines are pertinent to establishing low-cost manufacturing of reverse-engineered mRNA vaccines, as suggested by the WHO. A stepwise approach to establishing a compliant manufacturing facility, testing, supply chain, regulatory submissions, and intellectual property handling is presented. Expert opinion mRNA technology is more straightforward, and the cost of establishing a manufacturing facility is affordable, even in developing countries. The technology and supplies are widely available; however, based on experience, several misconceptions and misunderstandings about mRNA vaccines need to be removed, such as the regulatory and intellectual property issues that are resolved in this paper.

TI Delivering on the Pledge: Global Access to Medicines, VVTO Rules, and

SO MCGILL INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT LAW AND POLICY
AB The global AIDS crisis has highlighted the impor tance of expanded and sustainable access to lowercost, generic medicines in realising the development aspirations of many low-and middle-income countruies. In 2003, WTO members decided to relax a restriction in the TRIPS Agreement ostensibly to permit countr wis h insufficient pharmaceutical manufacturing capaciiy to make effective use of compuory licensing by importing generics. Canada and a handful of other Jurisdictions have implemented that WTO decision, but none of these gmes have yet been used to supply any developing country with any medicine. While Canadas law suffers from a number ofiatures that hinder its usefulness, more fundamentally he flaw lies in the underlying WTO decision. 7h article outlines the relevance of WTO rules on intellectual propery to the global inequity in access to medicines and reviews key developments at the WTO underlying such legislation It then discusses the key features, positive and negative, of Canada' law, and the two initiatives to dae to use it. Finally it presents reforms that would streamline the legislation, making it more likely to meet the needs of both developing country purchasers and potential generic exporters; the alternative regime presented here woul bypass the flawed 2003 WTO decision but remain TRIPS-compliant.

TI The WTO and the Doha Negotiation in Crisis?
SO NETHERLANDS YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, VOL 44, 2013
SE Netherlands Yearbook of International Law Series
AB Is the World Trade Organization (WTO) in a legitimacy crisis and might the protracted Doha negotiations be evidence of it? This article understands the notion of 'legitimacy crisis' as a severe threat to an institution's viability due to fundamental shifts in the legitimising ideas underlying the institution, an external threat to its values or its ability to fulfil its functions. It contends that the WTO is not yet definitely in a legitimacy crisis because the Doha negotiations still reveal the commitment of the WTO members to the values and legitimising ideas of the WTO. Perception of a legitimacy crisis fuels the negotiation of free trade agreements (FTAs) amongst key WTO members, which could be used to advance the Doha negotiations, force developing countries into agreement and shape the outcome of the negotiations in favour of developed countries. Such an outcome, this chapter cautions, could be the real onset of a legitimacy crisis if developing countries gain very little from a Doha agreement. To prevent a crisis and move the negotiations forward this chapter suggests that the different trade-related development needs of developing countries need to be assessed more seriously and developing countries need to be enabled to address serious adverse consequences linked to any trade liberalisation they undertake.

TI Waiting for election season
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Why do countries frequently wait long periods of time before initiating disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over antidumping duties? Since the WTO usually rules in favor of the complainant, countries should initiate disputes as quickly as possible to limit the time their domestic industries are subject to these duties. However, countries often wait years before initiating a dispute. I argue that government leaders time disputes around their elections to gain political support from large domestic industries, particularly in developing countries with fewer economic resources and countries with highly contested domestic politics, where even small electoral gains are crucial. Using data on all WTO disputes over antidumping duties, I run a discrete time hazard model and find evidence that countries are more likely to bring up a dispute the closer they get to elections. As expected, the effect is particularly strong for divided governments and developing countries as elections draw near.

TI Corporate wealth or public health? WTO/TRIPS flexibilities and access to
   HIV/AIDS antiretroviral drugs by developing countries
SO DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB Between 1994 and 2003, the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement of the WTO was refined to allow for flexibilities in the use of compulsory licences to import and export 'generic' varieties of pharmaceutical products, including ARV drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. After summarising this process, and assessing its implications in practice for developing countries, this article briefly places the current regime in a longerterm context of the institutional protection of patents in Britain and Europe dating from the nineteenth century. It traces how that pattern, which benefits major patent holders, continues to be present in TRIPS. The article goes on to demonstrate the continuity of corporate influence over the state, as expressed in the 'TRIPS-plus' conditions, which are appearing in bilateral free-trade agreements between the USA and either individual developing countries or regional groupings. This array of what amount to institutional obstacles to the sustained availability of cheap drugs presents serious problems for future operations of the supply chain for many imported medicines and, in the case of HIV/AIDS, has negative implications for the longterm clinical effectiveness of the most widely used drugs.

TI THE NEOLIBERAL TURN IN REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
SO WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
AB This Article makes two primary arguments. First, that the increased resort to bilateral and regional trade agreements has taken a neoliberal turn. As such bilateral and regional trade agreements are now a primary means through which greater investor protections, commodification of social services, guaranteed rights of investor access to investment opportunities, privatization of public service goods, and generally the diminution of sovereign control are being realized. These trade agreements make the foregoing goals possible not just in developing countries, but in industrialized economies as well. I show that these agreements provide business interests with opportunities to exercise concerted pressure to influence the adoption of neoliberal economic policies in both developed economies and developing economies.
   Second, this Article argues that bilateralism and regionalism in trade are contemporary fads that are spreading neoliberal economic ideals in the periphery of the global trading system. In other words, emulation by small developing countries of neoliberal economic policies in developed countries is a significant driver of economic reform. Developing countries adopt neoliberalism not simply because it is imposed, as many accounts suggest. Rather, neoliberalism is also voluntarily adopted for a variety of reasons: (i) because there has been a convergence in the thinking of policymakers and academic thinkers in developing and developed countries in part as a result of socialization through education or professional associations and contacts; (ii) as a result of persuasion that neoliberal reforms are important preconditions for goals such as increased economic growth or the efficiency of public sector institutions, developing country officials have adopted them; (iii) public officials in developing countries are strategically adopting neoliberal reforms since they are regarded as a signaling device that their country is 'safe' for investment or because bilateral and regional trade agreements come with budget support that is otherwise unavailable to these developing country officials in their home country; (iv) officials in developing countries are passive imitators who in the absence of solid evidence as to the efficacy of neoliberal ideals on their own account or in relation to alternative reform ideas are rationally bounded actors who find it impractical to assess the efficacy of neoliberal ideals or their alternatives.
   In short, this Article argues that the increased number of regional and bilateral trade agreements represents an important opportunity for the further diffusion of neoliberal economic ideals, an insight often missing in leading accounts that have emphasized how this trend conforms or departs from the norms of the World Trade Organization. This paper does so using a constructivist account of the circumstances under which neoliberalism arises in the turn towards regionalism and bilateralism. It shows how ideas about market governance and the institutions and experts that generate and perpetuate these ideas impose an incentive structure within which choices in favor of neoliberalism are more than less likely to be exercised.

The author concludes that the Doha negotiations on trade facilitation and on aid for trade demonstrate that such a legal arrangement cannot be constructed. This is not, however, a problem; the international community has provided extensive trade-related assistance through bilateral and multilateral development agencies. Regarding the overall Uruguay Round imbalance (developing countries gave more than they got), failure of the international community to acknowledge that the imbalance stems in major part from the WTO agreement on intellectual property (TRIPS) has retarded a general making-up.

TI INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: INDIAN SCENARIO

A major issue is to protect the unauthorized use of this knowledge and to provide protection to the creators of this knowledge in order to motivate them to invest money, time and effort for the creation of this knowledge and provide their inventions for the well being of the society. With the emergence of WTO, the subject of Intellectual Property Rights and their protection has become a central issue in economic development, scientific and technological development, protection of traditional knowledge and scientific and economic co-operation between industrialized and developing countries. Intellectual property will no longer be seen as distinct or self-contained domain, but rather as an important and effective policy instrument that would be relevant to a wider range of socio - economic, technological and political concerns, It has been seen that developing countries, including India, have been providing very weak intellectual property protection. But in view of further deepening of globalization and the provisions of WTO being becoming functional in year 2007, there is a need for India to paint the picture of Intellectual Property Protection with different colors. This article is an attempt to examine the efforts and developments that have been made and that have been planned in this direction.

AB The main aim of this paper is to examine and discuss major trade concerns over the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) by WTO member countries, with the particular emphasis on the European Union's SPS issues. While SPS measures are the key elements in the system of protection of life and health of people, animals and plants, numerous specific trade concerns (STCs) formally raised to the WTO, show that these measures are often considered to be overly restrictive and inconsistent with the provisions of the SPS Agreement. The analysis, based on the data retrieved from the SPS Information Management System of the WTO, revealed that both developed and developing countries play a significant role notifying specific trade concerns, with developing country notifications increasing faster. The European Union is active both as a party raising the SPS issues and maintaining the measures questioned by trade partners. The conducted analysis of specific trade concerns, helps to identify measures related to the EU's trade in agri-food products, which very likely constitute a tool of trade protectionism. Thus, the results have practical implications for governments and the EU's decision making bodies that can undertake actions to remove unjustified barriers as well as for the companies that need to take into account the existing SPS requirements in their foreign markets entry strategies.

TI NARES Capacity in Relation to International Treaties and Conventions on
   Intellectual Property Rights, Agricultural Biotechnology, and Plant
   Genetic Resources Management
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Significant developments in the scientific front and international policy arena have affected the use and exchange of genetic resources, and the management of intellectual property. These developments are now reshaping public agricultural research and development (R& D) in developing countries, especially in the access, generation, and dissemination of research outputs. Three of the most important international treaties and conventions that are important in this context are the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Already, majority of the developing countries are signatories to these treaties and could be expected to exploit them for their own advantage. On the other hand, non-member countries, despite their non-participation, must find alternative scenarios to be able to effectively address issues concerning IPR, agricultural biotechnology, and plant genetic resources.
   As the main source of innovation in public agricultural research, national agricultural research extension systems (NARES) need to be enlightened on the various aspects of these treaties and agreements and the impact on their respective research and extension activities. It may be necessary, for example, to tailor capacity-building initiatives on the IPR, agbiotech, and PGR aspects of international treaties to specific countries or regions since policy and enforcement mechanisms among NARES vary according to the availability of human and logistical resources, research priorities, and technology transfer objectives.
   This paper takes a look at the critical aspects of TRIPS, CBD, ITPGRFA, and other agreements, and studies their implications on public agbiotech R& D among NARS; compares initiatives by several Asian developing countries to comply with the provisions of these treaties and agreements; highlights PhilRice's initiatives to help its national government comply with its obligations under these treaties; and assesses and recommends a plan of action on the capacity-building of NARES institutions on IPR, agbiotech, and PGR management.

TI The Unique Features of the Trade Facilitation Agreement: A Revolutionary
   New Approach to Multilateral Negotiations or the Exception Which Proves
   the Rule?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) has received much attention for its unique approach to special and differential treatment, especially the ability of developing countries to self-designate their implementation periods and technical assistance needs. However, the Agreement contains other unique features which, though they have received less attention from commentators, may turn out to be more significant for multilateral rulemaking. Most notably, the self-designation and categorization of measures result in each developing country taking a Member-specific approach to its TFA commitments. While a Member-specific approach to market access commitments has been commonplace since the original GATT, rules commitments have tended to have a broad application to all Members or, where some differentiation of Members is used, to broad groups of Members based on objective criteria. In this sense, the TFA may have broken the mould for how rules commitments are negotiated. This article explores whether the TFA could open the door for Member-specific approaches to other rules areas at the WTO. With the current deadlock in multilateral trade negotiations, this aspect of the TFA may provide a template for negotiators to seek more nuanced and balanced outcomes for other rules negotiations such as anti-dumping.

TI Macro economic determinants of antidumping: A comparative analysis of
   developed and developing countries
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB This study examines how macro factors influence the use of antidumping in developed and developing countries. A panel data analysis of 99 countries over 1980-2000 reinforces the view that the primary jurisdiction for the antidumping law is really more political than economic. Furthermore. it suggests that once the WTO is fully enforced, the use of antidumping will spread among developing countries not only due to greater liberalization pressures but also as many countries would like to create an antidumping ability so Lis to counter its use against them. This may reverse the trade gains that liberalization may ensure to them. This paper thus calls for the granting of the special and differential treatment to developing countries in this provision. Finally, based on its findings, the paper argues that future negotiations should be directed toward revising safeguard rules and replacing antidumping by this new clause. (C) 27004 Elsevier Ltd.

Although small in volume, alternative trade represents a unique response to the relentless pursuit of free trade through the GATT/WTO process. The economic underpinnings of both Fair Trade and subsidy programs in general (such as the EU's Stabilization of Exchange system) are evaluated. Ultimately, alternative trade can provide significant assistance to targeted groups within developing countries, including gains in production and export proficiency. On the negative side, Fair Trade is likely to prolong the dependence of developing countries on products with poor future prospects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the wake of the failure of the inward-looking development policy during the 1970s, Bangladesh embarked on a substantially greater globalisation of its economy in the early 1980s through export promotion and removal of import-restrictions. The endeavour has had a remarkable impact on the growth of labour-intensive manufacturing exports from Bangladesh, which in turn has contributed to GDP growth. This paper observes that Bangladesh's export regime rests on a domestic incentive structure that is highlighted by market distortions and, therefore, is inherently weak. Over the years, Bangladesh's export sector has been the beneficiary of a range of favourable conditions such as the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) facilities. The phasing out of these facilities from 2005 as spelled out in the GATT (1993) and WTO (1995) accords, and the corrections of domestic market distortions will have serious impact on the long-term growth of Bangladesh' exports. The paper also underlines that extreme reliance on a single export item namely, textiles and readymade garments, the lack of export-market diversification, the absence of backward linkages to the readymade garments, the high import-content of the apparel industry and the lack of innovation may render Bangladesh's present export-regime highly susceptible to external shocks and/or competition from other developing countries.

TI Alliances, Trade Discrimination, and the Global Trade Regime
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB Although nondiscrimination is a central tenet of the global trade regime, discrimination was in fact common under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, particularly against developing countries. The latter have recently sought to end such discrimination through World Trade Organization rules: for example, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) prohibited quota discrimination in this sector. I examine the ATC's impact on US discrimination, asking whether the ATC ended the US policy of favoring allies with generous textile and clothing quotas. I find that, while the United States favored allies before the ATC, this favoritism vanished in the post-ATC period. The ATC thus accomplished its goal of ending explicit textile and clothing discrimination. This result underscores the potential for multilateral rules to control trade discrimination and implies that popular theories of trade policy may be contingent on such rules.

   Promotion of Domestic Industrial Development in Developing Countries in
   the Absence of Local Working Requirements: Rethinking the Role of the
   World Intellectual Property Organization in Intellectual Property
   Standard-Setting
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB This article confronts the most basic question, which is whether in its traditional legislative intent the principle of patent working requirements would as an instrument of government policy in the mist of global value chains definitely guarantee industrial growth for developing countries and least developed countries LDCs. The author argues that globalization has promoted an increasing fragmentation of production, that is, in a dynamic economic efficiency and open trade environment, much of manufacturing today is trade in components from different sources, and seeking to produce all of them locally would be contrary to division of labour and undermines the very existence of the WTO's mandate to preserve the basic principles and to further the overriding objectives underlying the multilateral trading system, which is to reduce barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade relations. Therefore, a key distinction in thinking about policy is that as an instrument of government policy the patent working requirement is, on its own, insufficient, less prudence and not the smartest route to secure rapid socio-economic growth, as countries have more to lose from a confrontational scenario of implementing patent working requirements, and more to gain when they join the global supply chain to exploit its numerous opportunities.

TI The effect of nonreciprocal preferential trade agreements on

SO EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB Over the last decades, developed countries have provided developing countries with preferential market access via trade policies in the form of nonreciprocal preferential trade agreements (NRPTAs). Despite the lack of reciprocity of this kind of agreements, certain criteria for designating eligible countries refer to the commercial interests of benefactor countries. This paper examines for the first time the effect of NRPTAs on benefactors' exports to beneficiary countries. Using recent developments in the econometric analysis of the gravity equation, we find robust evidence that nonreciprocal agreements have had an economically significant effect on exports not only for beneficiary countries but also for benefactor countries.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The need for a legal solution to the compulsory licence problem was outlined in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of 14 November 2001. The agreement subsequently reached by WTO Members on 30 August 2003 in response to paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration is seen as key to improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. This article re-examines the negotiations that led to the 30 August agreement and assesses its likely impact. It then argues that compulsory licensing is one of a range of policy approaches that will ultimately assist in improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. The article suggests that a long-term achievement of the Doha-based negotiations is likely to be in refocusing attention on the potential of other measures that can operate alongside compulsory licensing provisions. It concludes that the debate about the Doha Declaration and compulsory licensing is part of a much wider problem and the solution requires a mix of policy initiatives.

TI Binding Tariff Preferences for Developing Countries Under Article II
   Gatt
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Tariff preferences, which are authorized under the WTO Enabling Clause and autonomous waivers, are often withdrawn on dubious grounds and without due process. This reduces much of their potential value, because traders and investors lack the predictability and security necessary to make long-term business decisions based on the market access opportunities that these preferences provide. Some developing countries have responded to this by concluding regional trade agreements (RTAs) under Article XXIV of the GATT, despite the sometimes heavy price of reciprocity. In this article, we offer an alternative. We make two practical proposals to provide the maximum possible security and predictability for both preference beneficiaries and donors. First, we argue that, contrary to what is often assumed, it is perfectly possible to bind tariff preferences under existing WTO rules. Second, based upon an examination of the current state of the law, we propose that any withdrawals of products and countries from tariff preference programs, whether by way of temporary safeguards or definitive 'graduation', should be based on objective and legally secure criteria. These criteria should also be scheduled as qualifications to bound preferences under Article II of the GATT. These reforms are possible without any change to existing WTO rules.

TI Managing the effect of TRIPS on availability of priority vaccines
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB The stated purpose of intellectual property protection is to stimulate innovation. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires all Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to enact national laws conferring minimum standards of intellectual property protection by certain deadlines. Critics of the Agreement fear that such action is inconsistent with ensuring access to medicines in the developing world. A WHO convened meeting on intellectual property rights and vaccines in developing countries, on which this paper is based, found no evidence that TRIPS has stimulated innovation in developing market vaccine development (where markets are weak) or that protection of intellectual property rights has had a negative effect on access to vaccines. However, access to future vaccines in the developing world could be threatened by compliance with TRIPS. The management of such threats requires adherence of all countries to the Doha Declaration on TRIPS, and the protections guaranteed by the Agreement itself, vigilance on TRIPS-plus elements of free trade agreements, developing frameworks for licensing and technology transfer, and promoting innovative vaccine development in developing countries. The role of international organizations in defining best practices, dissemination of information, and monitoring TRIPS impact will be crucial to ensuring optimal access to priority new vaccines for the developing world.

TI Multilateral trade liberalization and developing countries' economic
   exposure to shocks
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of multilateral trade policy (MTP) liberalization on developing countries' economic exposure to shocks.
   Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is conducted on a panel data set comprising 120 countries over the period 1996-2013 and uses the within fixed effects estimator.
   Findings - The empirical results suggest that over the entire sample as well as sub-samples of least developed countries (LDCs) and non-LDCs, multilateral trade liberalization have a negative and significant impact on economic exposure to shocks. Interestingly, LDCs appear to experience the highest magnitude of the reducing impact of multilateral trade liberalization on countries' economic exposure to shocks.
   Research limitations/implications - These findings suggest that a greater cooperation among countries in the world, including among WTO members to further liberalize trade would surely contribute to reducing developing countries' economic exposure to shocks.
   Practical implications - The current study shows that the current backlash against trade and the consequent strong appeal for domestic trade protectionist measures would likely to undermine the likelihood of further multilateral trade liberalization. One implication of this could be a rise in countries' economic exposure to shocks.
   Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, this is first the study on this matter.

   Dependency
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB This article critiques the notion of food security through trade promoted by suprastate organizations like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. We use and refine the food-regime perspective to contest this unwritten rule of the neoliberal food regime. Rather than mutual dependency in food between North and South, as argued by Philip McMichael, however, we show that food dependency has been stronger on basic foods in developing countries, while advanced capitalist countries' dependency has been mostly on luxury foods. Also, the more that developing countries become dependent on food imports and exports, the more they will be importing the world food price for the relevant commodities. Food-price inflation will more adversely affect their working classes, which spend larger shares of their household budgets on food. Our empirical focus is on food dependency in emerging nationsBrazil, China, India, Mexico, and Turkeyin comparison with long-standing agricultural exporting powerhouses, the United States and Canada. Using longitudinal data from FAOSTAT, we show that food security in the neoliberal food regime can best be characterized as uneven and combined dependency.

AB This article summarizes some of the results and findings emerging from an ongoing World Bank research and capacity-building project that focuses on the World Trade Organization (wto) negotiating agenda from a developing country perspective. Recent research suggests that the potential gains from further multilateral liberalization of trade remain very large. The payoffs associated with attempts to introduce substantive disciplines in the wto on domestic regulatory regimes are much less certain. This suggests that the focus of current and future negotiations should be primarily on the bread and butter of the multilateral trading system-the progressive liberalization of barriers to trade in goods and services on a nondiscriminatory basis. In addition, priority should be given to ensuring that rules are consistent with the development needs of poorer countries and to helping developing countries implement wto obligations.

TI Legal Aspects (Barriers) of Granting Compulsory Licenses for Clean
   Technologies in Light of WTO/TRIPS Rules: Promise or Mirage?
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB The development and use of clean technologies constitute a useful means of mitigating global warming. Although certain developing countries have become major emitters of greenhouse gases, they are not in a position to access the clean technologies that are prevalent in developed nations. In advocating technology transfers under the United Nations' climate change regime, developing countries argue that the intellectual property regime covering climate-related technologies must be ameliorated. In their proposals, they argue that compulsory licensing for clean technologies can be instrumental in furthering global access. This paper examines the legal issues associated with granting compulsory licenses for clean technologies. I analyze the legal challenges to authorizing such licenses, particularly in light of WTO/TRIPS and of national practices. An analysis of the previous practices surrounding the application of compulsory licensing reveals the severe hurdles facing competent national authorities and indicates the costs and burdens of such an action, which not every WTO member can afford. Jumping to the conclusion that the compulsory licensing of clean technologies is simply an illusory option may be premature; nevertheless, the legal barriers and burdens may dissuade developing nations from using such licenses injudiciously.

AB Globalization of the food system increases the shared risks from food safety, making it a global public good. Globally shared food safety risks include microbial pathogens, pesticide residues, or mycotoxins. Food safety is addressed as a global public good through improved private sector information, institutional innovations such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards Agreement under the World Trade Organization, and trade capacity building to improve food safety in developing country exports. Although meeting standards for high-income consumers motivates trade facilitation, there could be large positive spillovers for developing country consumers from such investments.

TI Opportunities to strengthen trade policy for food and nutrition
   security: an analysis of two agricultural trade policy decisions
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Food insecurity and the double burden of malnutrition have emerged as prevailing global health challenges of the twenty-first century. These have been influenced by trade policy decisions, particularly in relation to agriculture, which are highly political and can have large effects on global, national, and local food systems. The aim of this study was to analyse two multilateral trade policy decisions relevant to food and nutrition security, to understand the political and power dynamics in the spaces in which these decisions are being made at the global level, in order to strengthen trade-related food systems governance to improve population nutrition. This qualitative policy analysis drew on data from a targeted literature and policy review, as well as in-depth interviews with eight individuals with expert knowledge and/or involvement in the case studies. The analysis focussed on policy processes and power dynamics, drawing on two frameworks from political science. This study found that power dynamics were shifting, such that developing countries had more of a voice at these multilateral negotiations, and decisions reflected growing resistance from developing countries who were unable to protect their most vulnerable. Contextual factors such as level of food insecurity, socio-economic situation, and historical institutional processes at the World Trade Organisation, were influential in shaping actor agendas. The study suggests that engagement with the historical context of agricultural trade policy, the global spaces in which these policy decisions take place, and creating strong coalitions will be essential to create sustainable and equitable future food systems.

TI Collapse at the WTO: a Cancun post-mortem
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB This article offers an analysis of the collapse of the WTO talks in Cancun in September 2003. It argues that the collapse of the talks should not be regarded as a victory for the developing world, as many have suggested. Rather, the collapse should be seen as the inevitable result of deep-seated tensions within the WTO'S institutional framework, both in terms of the processes that underlie its working and the substance of its agreements. The article argues that these imbalances, if not corrected, will heighten the alienation of developing countries and work to the detriment of the legitimacy and survival of the WTO.

TI Trade policy space and foreign direct investment inflows
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
AB Purpose This study aims to use a quantitative measure of trade policy space to investigate empirically whether trade policy space influences foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to countries. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis covers an unbalanced panel data set of 158 countries, over the period 1995-2015 and uses the two-step system generalized methods of moments approach. Findings The results suggest that the impact of trade policy space on FDI inflows is positive and increases as countries enjoy greater trade policy space. Furthermore, advanced economies tend to experience a higher positive impact of trade policy space on FDI inflows than less advanced economies. Research limitations/implications These findings highlight the relevance of trade policy space for countries' FDI inflows. Practical implications The analysis shows that non-trade related constraints to trade policy could reduce trade policy space and adversely influence FDI inflows, which are critical for countries' economic growth and development. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the literature.

TI Legalization and dispute settlement benefits: The case of the GATT/WTO
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB This study investigates how the legalization of the GATT into the WTO affects the distribution of its dispute settlement benefits between developed and developing countries. Existing studies present two arguments to this question - the capacity argument emphasizing the importance of economic capacity for the use of the dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) and the legalization argument suggesting its participatory effects for developing countries. Statistical data about the use of the DSM under the GATT and the early WTO provide some support for the capacity argument, while those under the WTO of its whole period for the legalization argument. However, the capacity theory fails to explain the use of the DSM by developed and developing countries after about the year, 2000, while the legalization theory has so far lacked an adequate empirical support. The purpose of this study is to find out why the capacity theory fails to do so, and to provide more empirical support for the legalization theory. It finds that the respective impacts of economic capacity and socialization experiences on the use of the DSM under the GATT/WTO vary depending on the degree of its legalization: that is, under the less legalized GATT a member country's economic capacity is important, while under the legalized WTO its previous experiences are so, for its use of the DSM. The legalization has definitely attenuated the impact of its economic capacity on the use of the DSM, while it has strengthened the impact of its previous experiences on it very positively in the first half period of the WTO, and positively in its second half period. These results may mean that the WTO has by now leveled the playing field of dispute settlement not only for its economically less capable members but also for its relatively less experienced ones.

TI Fair in Form, But Discriminatory in Operation-WTO Law's Discriminatory
   Effects on Human Rights in Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB There are many points of intersection between the law of the World Trade Organization and international human rights law. This article looks at one such, where WTO law requires developing countries to introduce measures that may have disproportionately adverse impacts on the human rights of individuals or groups who are protected under human rights law from discrimination. Indirect discrimination of this kind usually occurs because prior discriminatory treatment has created social and economic inequalities that subsequent, apparently neutral-or 'fair in form'-measures exacerbate. Country studies of Nicaragua and Ghana provide evidence that indirectly discriminatory impacts might occur as a result of the reductions in agricultural tariffs proposed in the Doha Round for developing countries. While laws which have discriminatory effects may be justifiable, discrimination on the basis of race or sex is anathema to human rights law and will be subjected to intense justificational scrutiny. The article scrutinizes the justifiability of the proposed agricultural tariff reductions, concluding that less damaging alternatives are available and could be adopted at the multilateral level. It is argued that the potential discrimination is best dealt with at this level, since it is the law-making level and the discrimination is unlikely to be corrected through domestic, remedial action within developing countries.

TI Certificates of Free Sale: Who is Being Protected from Whom?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Certificates of Free Sale (CFS) are little known but widely used instruments in international trade. A CFS states that a product meets the regulatory requirements of the exporting country and can be sold freely in that country. Many developing countries require a CFS as a condition of importation in sensitive sectors, such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cosmetics, and food products. This paper is the first major work to explore the legal implications of certificates of free sale. It describes various CFS requirements and examines the WTO-legality of trade restrictions imposed by importing countries based on the failure of exported goods to meet the domestic standards of the exporting country. The authors conclude that most CFS schemes are likely to violate WTO obligations. They suggest WTO-consistent ways of protecting legitimate developing country interests that eliminate the need for CFS schemes.

TI Leadership in the WTO: Brazil, India and the Doha development agenda
SO CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB The Doha round of multilateral negotiations has witnessed the relocation of Southern powers towards the core of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decision-making structure. Brazil and India are the only developing countries that have participated consistently in all major ministerial phases of the Doha round between 2001 and 2008. Their consolidation as trading powers cannot be attributed solely to their status as emerging economies. Their projected legitimacy as representatives of the global South has operated as a catalyst in facilitating their relocation. In various phases of negotiations, however, Brazil and India have refrained from playing a proactive role in driving negotiations forward. Their defensive stance has raised questions about the two countries' prospects for systemic leadership in world trade. In explaining this condition, this article will argue that Brazilian and Indian trade diplomacy is consistently directed towards maintaining broad bases of followership. Brazil and India are disposed to exercise assertive leadership only when that accommodates the expectations and preferences of their followership in the global South. Their preoccupation with constantly reasserting their Third World image often renders blocking agreement the preferable strategy to avoid paying a high price in terms of legitimacy.

TI Potential Accession to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement: A
   Case-Study on India
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is a voluntary plurilateral agreement applicable to WTO members that choose to be Parties to the Agreement. Most developing countries, including India, are not members of the GPA. This case study presents an insight into India's current procurement framework, evaluates the prospects for, and comments on the principal constraints and challenges to India's GPA accession. The findings suggest that, though the Indian procurement system is evolving and aims to align the regime with the GPA, there are considerable policy issues, capacity constraints, corruption and transparency failures in procurement practices that will need to be addressed before India can join the WTO GPA.

TI On the emergence of an MFN club: equal treatment in an unequal world
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE
AB Motivated by GATT, we endogenize the formation of a club whose members have to abide by the MFN principle of non-discrimination. The underlying model is that of oligopolistic intraindustry trade. While an MFN club does not alter average tariff levels across countries, it increases aggregate world welfare; makes non-members worse off; and can immiserize its high cost members. These results imply that (i) core WTO rules such as MFN are valuable even if multilateral negotiations deliver limited trade liberalization and (ii) the distributional effects of MFN maybe one reason why developing countries have been granted Special and Differential treatment at the WTO.

TI On the Legality of the United States Action of Terminating India's GSP
   Status
SO FOREIGN TRADE REVIEW
AB Since the US Presidential Proclamation terminating India status as a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) beneficiary with effect from 5 June 2019, questions are raised on the WTO legitimacy of such an action. The US measure, which appears to have a punitive element-a move precipitated by lack of reciprocity from India by not providing 'equitable and reasonable access' for US products in Indian markets-challenges the fundamentally premise of the GSP schemes. Since the GSP schemes are established to provide economic and developmental opportunities for developing countries, and once established must be administered as per the 1979 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Enabling Clause, meaning it must be on a 'generalised', 'non-reciprocal' and 'non-discriminatory' basis, can India raise a legitimate challenge against the US action at the WTO Dispute Settlement Body? Or can the GSP schemes, being voluntary and unilaterally administered, be structured by developed countries as trade policy tools with stringent trade and non-trade conditionalities? The decision of the Appellate Body in European Communities-Tariff Preferences, the contested nature of the Enabling Clause and the heterogeneous nature of developing countries at the WTO makes the interpretation knotty. In this context, this article provides a brief comment on the legal basis of the Enabling Clause in the WTO framework and the legitimacy of the US action of termination of India from the beneficiary status. Keeping aside the legal question, the author is also of the view that time is ripe for India to consider 'graduating' itself from such preferential arrangements and engage in binding obligations that are reciprocal and sustainable.

TI SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE: SPECIAL
   CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB In the United Nations Millennium Declaration and Millennium Development Goals ('MDGs'), UN Members resolved to address the special needs of small island developing states ('SIDS'). One part of this is ensuring that the international trade regime contributes to their development. These issues have been discussed both in the UN system, as part of the implementation and review of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, and in the World Trade Organization, primarily through the WTO Work Programme on Small Economies. This article examines proposals made in these contexts to enhance the competitiveness of SIDS in a free global market and their effective participation in the multilateral regime. Responses to these proposals show some willingness to provide assistance to SIDS, but resistance to the recognition of further exceptions for certain subcategories of developing countries, reflecting larger debates about special and differential treatment for developing countries in the WTO. It is concluded that if, as seems likely, limited recognition of SIDS needs will be provided within the trade regime, the international community must take its assistance commitments seriously, and it will be beneficial to maintain linkages between SIDS trade issues and the broader context of the MDGs.

TI Harmonization, regulation, and trade: Interactions in the pharmaceutical
   field
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB This article aims to draw attention to the process of harmonization of requirements for drug registration (the so-called ICH process) and to examine how it may affect access to medicines in developing countries. The ICH process, especially when seen in conjunction with the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, may create additional barriers to would-be entrants on the global pharmaceutical market, notably large generic manufacturers in developing countries-the very companies that can create credible price competition for the innovative industry and, thus, increase access to medicines. These barriers could help maintain the status quo by insulating well-established companies from competition, thereby forming a further obstacle to lower drug prices and to access to medicines, especially in developing countries. Developing countries should therefore carefully consider the implications of the positioning of ICH standards as global standards, and be vigilant with regard to their possible incorporation, whether explicitly or not, in international trade agreements.

TI Globalization and environment: Effects of international trade on
   emission intensity reduction of pollutants causing global and local
   concerns
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB International trade's impact on the pollution reduction, especially varied reduction effects dealing with global or local pollutants has not been thoroughly researched empirically. We explored effects of international trade participation on both the carbon dioxide emission intensity and sulfur dioxide emission intensity with a panel data of 179 major countries during 20 years when globalization thrived. Carbon dioxide causing climate change is a global concern. While sulfur dioxide is one major air pollutant causing local health problems. Empirically, international trade participation mainly reduces carbon dioxide emission intensity but not sulfur dioxide emission intensity. Also, trade in goods form is more effective than in service form. However, international trade participation does little to improving a country's overall technology level, implying that regulation enhancement under international norm is the main mechanism. Compared with developed countries, developing countries can reduce both kinds of pollutant emission intensities more effectively by participating into international trade. A case study of China's entering into World Trade Organization (WTO)'s impact on pollutant reduction can provide more evidence. Also, developing countries with higher industrialization level experiences a bigger improvement in cleaner production. And developing countries with higher democratization level pay more attention to reduce local environmental concerns.

TI Determining a "Reasonable" Implementation Timeline for Developing
   Countries in WTO Disputes: An Appraisal of Special Treatment Commitments
   in DSU Article 21.3 (c) Arbitrations
SO LAW & PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS
AB The Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) prescribes three diffferent types of arbitration which are ancillary to the Panel and Appellate Body functions of the WTO dispute settlement system (DSS). These are the arbitrations for determining the implementation timeline under Article 21.3 (c) of the DSU and two other types of arbitration under Articles 21.5 and 22.6. This article focuses on some specific approaches and functions of Article 21.3 (c) arbitrations and examines the procedural actions which are related to determining a suitable implementation time for developing countries. It investigates the consistency and coherence of practice in selected arbitral awards in which developing countries claimed "particular attention" either as complainant or as implementing parties. This article points out that the lack of specific guidelines in the DSU is the substantial cause for arbitrators' noncompliance with Article 21.2 provisions in Article 21.3 (c) arbitrations, which questions the procedural fairness of such arbitrations. This situation, amongst others, reiterates the urgent necessity to amend the relevant DSU rules.

TI Negotiating North-South dynamics and the Philippine experience in the

SO PACIFIC REVIEW
AB This paper elucidates how domestic and external factors have shaped the negotiating policy of the Philippines in bringing about incremental gains not only for its benefit but also for other developing countries during the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture Doha Development Round (DDR). The internal factors include the following: (1) executive monopoly of the WTO negotiations; (2) issue-based fragmentation and dispersal of authority; (3) the autonomy and flexibility of the Philippine WTO negotiator; (4) the involvement of civil society in the WTO negotiations, and (4) the central role of the Department of Agriculture as the lead agency in the WTO negotiations. A major reason for this is attributed to an external factor which is the centrality of agriculture as a major WTO issue among developing countries. Other external factors, on the other hand, include the following: (1) the strong solidarity among developing countries and (2) the confinement to particular issues with regards to coalition-building. These factors helped to strengthen the bargaining leverage of the Philippines, a seemingly weak' country, vis-a-vis the developed countries in the WTO.

AB International trade is a significant factor in the introduction of invasive alien species around the world. The preparedness of countries through their domestic regulations to combat invasive alien species differs from country to country. This article discusses the potential of WTO law in combating the spread of invasive alien species in countries with weak environmental regulation regimes such as Botswana. It recognises the possibility of invoking provisions of WTO agreements by member states to combat the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. It concludes that the use of WTO agreements by developing countries may be an immediate solution to address and combat biodiversity losses in the global south. The article recommends the building of technical and scientific capacity by developing countries to effectively use international trade law for environmental protection.

These two approaches also do not agree on which institution should address labour standards (WTO vs ILO) and the obligations that come with them.

TI Equality and inequality in the WTO dispute settlement (DS) system:
   Analysis of the GATT/WTO dispute data
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB This article explores the distributive aspects of the dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) of the World Trade Organization WTO. Even though the strictly binding dispute settlement (DS) system can operate in an unbiased way and thereby minimize power disparity among disputants, in general, the content of law on which the whole DS system is based is favorable to developed countries in the system. This study of the WTO DSM demonstrates that (1) the procedural/substantive dispute outcomes of the WTO are not significantly affected by power disparity between disputants (thus, enhancing the principles of "equality before the law" and "protecting the weak"), but that (2) the strict substantive provisions and the newly included provisions of the WTO agreements are advantageous to developed countries and disadvantageous to developing countries (thus, increased inequality in the content of the law). In order to understand the distributive consequences of the legal DSM, we need to combine an analysis of the operation of the legal body with an examination of the content of the law.

TI Using dispute settlement partnerships for capacity building Bangladesh's
   triumphant experience at WTO DSU
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose World Trade Organisation grants rights to its members, and WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides a rule-oriented consultative and judicial mechanism to protect these rights in cases of WTO-incompatible trade infringements. However, the DSU participation benefits come at a cost. These costs are acutely formidable for least developing countries (LDCs) which have small market size and trading stakes. No LDC has ever filed a WTO compliant, with the only exception of India-Battery dispute filed by Bangladesh against India. This paper aims to look at the experience of how Bangladesh - so far the only LDC member that has filed a formal WTO complaint - persuaded India to withdraw anti-dumping duties India had imposed on the import of acid battery from Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach The investigation is grounded on practically informed findings gathered through authors' work experience and several semi-structured interviews and discussions which the authors have conducted with government representatives from Bangladesh, government and industry representatives from other developing countries, trade lawyers and officials based in Geneva and Brussels, and civil society organisations. Findings The discussion provides a sound indication of the participation impediments that LDCs can face at WTO DSU and the ways in which such challenges can be overcome with the help of resources available at the domestic level. It also exemplifies how domestic laws and practices can respond to international legal instruments and impact the performance of an LDC at an international adjudicatory forum. Originality/value Except one book chapter and a working paper, there is no literature available on this matter. This investigation is grounded on practically informed findings gathered with the help of original empirical research conducted by the authors.

TI Labor Standards and WTO Rules: Survey of the Issues with Reference to
   Child Labor in South Asia
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB Some developed countries have sought to counteract what they see as unfair competition faced by their domestic industries arising from the employment of child labor in the production of consumer goods in developing countries by including a "social clause" in the World Trade Organization (WTO) charter. Many people and civil society organizations in developed countries are also genuinely concerned with child labor employment purely on humanitarian grounds. In this paper we have argued that a more appropriate approach to tackle the child labor problem would be to facilitate acceleration of growth in developing countries through greater, not less, integration of these countries into the world trading system. We have also argued that directing development assistance for improving institutions and social infrastructure would be more effective than trade sanctions.

TI Engagement to Global Production Networks in Southeast Asia: Prospects
   for Technology Upgrade and Lessons for Latin America
SO MEXICO Y LA CUENCA DEL PACIFICO
AB Developing countries are under constant pressure to improve economic conditions and generate sources of employment. To achieve these goals, in the last few decades the mantra has been to engage in global production networks and carry out institutional reforms to attract foreign capital. However, the current set of ideas about globalization is dominated by the premise that economic institutions should aim to insert national economies (or sub-regions) into certain stages of production and specialization (Baldwin, 2012, 2013; Gereffi & Sturgeon, 2013; World Trade Organization, 2011). Developing countries are often targeted at the extractive and labor intensive stages, thus influencing the reforms to become as functional nodes of the global capitalist network. This article argues that any institutional reformulation must contemplate a two-track strategy instead of a single one. This is, the economy must be restructured to attract foreign direct investment, but it must also seek to develop domestic capacities independently not only engage local capital, preferably in high value-added stages, but also to socially master as many phases of the production process as possible. Thus, it is suggested to reconsider an updated developmental industrial policy as the guiding thread of economic policy.

TI Universal access in developing countries: A particular focus on
   Bangladesh
SO INFORMATION SOCIETY
AB The concept of universal access, which originated in the United States, is now part of the telecommunications policy frameworks of many developing countries. This article uses the case of Bangladesh as a vehicle for examining the transferability of the universal service concept to developing countries. The analysis suggests that liberalization and privatization of the telecommunications sector policies pushed by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, and other international agencies, will not by themselves create universal access in countries with rudimentary urban-centric networks. The policymakers need to incorporate build-out obligations when licensing operators and also develop cross-subsidy mechanisms even though they are now out of fashion in the industrialized world.

TI Institutional Responses on Strengthened Intellectual Property Rights in
   Agriculture and Needs' Assessment on Intellectual Property Management of
   Public Research Institutions in Asian Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION
AB Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are being introduced or strengthened in developing countries as a result of international agreements such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This study conducted a web-based survey to gain perspective on the impact of IPRs to public research institutions in developing countries and how these institutions have responded to IPR developments. Specifically, this survey collected information from research directors (n=43) of public research organizations in India, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Overall, this study strongly indicates that research administrators in the five countries are positive towards IPRs and the implementation of measures to build their institutional IPR management capacities. They have also started to build their IPR structures and procedures by setting up IP policies and offices, but strengthening is needed, particularly in the area of technology commercialization. This research serves as a reference for international institutions interested in and/or evaluating capacity programs allowing them to craft projects that can better foster the importance of IP management to these and similar institutes in the developing world.

TI Impact of trade facilitation reforms on tax revenue
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the empirical literature of the macroeconomic effect of trade facilitation reforms by examining the impact of the latter on tax revenue in both developed and developing countries. The relevance of the topic lies on the fact that at the Bali Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2013, Trade Ministers agreed for the first time since the creation of the WTO (in 1995) on an Agreement to facilitate trade around the world, dubbed Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The study considers both at-the-border and behind-the border measures of Trade Facilitation.
   Design/methodology/approach - To conduct this study, the authors rely on the literature related to the structural factors that explain tax revenue mobilization. The authors mainly use within fixed effects estimator. The analysis relies on 102 countries (of which 23 industrial countries) over the period 2004-2007 (based on data availability). A focus has also been made on African countries, within the sample of developing countries.
   Findings - The empirical analysis suggests evidence of a positive and significant effect of trade facilitation reforms on non-resources tax revenue, irrespective of the sample of countries considered in the analysis.
   Research limitations/implications - This finding should contribute to dampening the fear of policymakers in developing countries, including Africa that the implementation of the TFA would entail higher costs, without necessarily being associated with higher benefits. An avenue for future research would be to extend the period of the study when data would be available.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors knowledge, this study had not been performed in the literature of the determinants of tax revenue mobilization, although fact-based analysis was performed.

TI The Impact of Aid for Trade Facilitation on the Costs of Trading
SO KYKLOS
AB There have been ongoing discussions within the WTO Doha Round on Trade Facilitation and the wider Aid for Trade agenda to assist developing countries in reducing behind-the-border restrictions and to help them benefit from trade reform. Our paper contributes to this debate by analyzing the impact of foreign aid spent on Aid for Trade and Trade Facilitation on the costs of trading. In our empirical investigation, we conduct a panel data estimation for a sample of 99 developing countries for the period 20042009. Overall, we find that our aid measures are negatively associated with the costs of trading.

TI Tobacco control and the World Trade Organization: mapping member states'
   positions after the framework convention on tobacco control
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
AB Objective To note the frequency of discussions and disputes about tobacco control measures at the World Trade Organization (WTO) before and after the coming into force of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). To review trends or patterns in the positions taken by members of the WTO with respect to tobacco control measures. To discuss possible explanations for these observed trends/patterns.
   Methods We gathered data on tobacco-related disputes in the WTO since its establishment in 1995 and its forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), prior-FCTC and post-FCTC. We also looked at debates on tobacco control measures within the WTO more broadly. To this end, we classified and coded the positions of WTO member states during discussions on tobacco control and the FCTC, from 1995 until 2013, within the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council.
   Results There is a growing interest within the WTO for tobacco-related issues and opposition to tobacco control measures is moving away from high-income countries towards low(er) income countries.
   Conclusions The growing prominence of tobacco issues in the WTO can be attributed at least in part to the fact that during the past decade tobacco firms have been marginalised from the domestic policy-making process in many countries, which has forced them to look for other ways and forums to influence decision-making. Furthermore, the finding that almost all recent opposition within the WTO to stronger tobacco regulations came from developing countries is consistent with a relative shift of transnational tobacco companies' lobbying efforts from developed to developing countries.

TI The Uruguay Round and agricultural policies in developing countries and
   economies in transition
SO FOOD POLICY
AB This paper reviews changes in the global trade policy environment as a result of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, and their potential impact on developing countries and economies in transition, The Agreement is, except in a few cases, not likely to present these countries with major policy adjustment problems, In Latin America, unilateral reforms have proceeded further than required by the Agreement, In Africa, countries that have experienced structural adjustment are liberalizing faster than the Agreement requires, In Asia the situation is mixed, but in general agricultural trade liberalization appears to be moving more slowly, especially when compared to Latin America; progress in reducing quantitative restrictions has been slow, In Eastern Europe and the CIS, the progression and completeness of liberalization varies widely, though GATT notions of tariffication and tariff bindings have strengthened the position of reformers in those countries that are members of the WTO, While the short term impact of the Agreement may be modest, the bringing of agriculture under the rules of GATT should help prevent reintroducing non-tariff restrictions in the future, However, given that much of the food imports, particularly in parts of Asia, are still conducted by parastatals, if state trading is GATT-legal it is hard to anticipate how strong discipline on trade distorting support could be brought about.

TI Towards an alternative perspective on trade and industrial policies
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB Trade policy is at a crossroads, as is trade diplomacy, in the form of trade negotiations under the auspicious of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Widespread 'traditional' import substitution industrialization (ISI) strategies, which prevailed from the 1950s to the 1970s, failed. Across-the-board trade liberalization, recommended by the international financial institutions (IFIs) and neoliberal scholars in the 1980s and 1990s to promote outward-oriented industrialization and development, fared no better. What is next ? Drawing on the experiences of developing countries in trade liberalization and economic reform in recent years, as well as the history of those countries which underwent early industrialization, this article aims to develop an alternative approach to trade and industrial policy by taking a bottom-up approach. The author presents a national policy framework (that is, a view of what is needed at the national level to catch up in the process of industrialization) and, on that basis, argues for changes in international trade rules.

AB Access to international markets will be an important factor in investment decisions for firms engaging in the research and development of agricultural biotechnology. International market access can be restricted in two ways: the imposition of trade barriers and intellectual property piracy. This paper develops a model of the enforcement game between a developing country's government and a foreign biotechnology firm to examine the efficacy of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement for the protection of intellectual property in agricultural biotechnology. The conclusion is that the TRIPS is unlikely to provide sufficient protection and, thus, will lead to suboptimal levels of investment.

AB This paper explores the reasons and motivations for Vietnam's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007. On the basis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with elites, secondary sources, and official documents, we point to the relevance of political economy considerations in this decision. In particular, Vietnamese authorities used WTO accession as an instrument to lock-in internal structural reforms, signal political stability to trade partners, and secure market access to Western consumer markets. Accession comes after a qualitative change in the export pattern (increased added value) that also meant new trade partners, mostly Western partners. Therefore, we interpret VVTO accession as the final step of a wider process of economic and trade "Westernization".

TI WTO government procurement rules and the local dynamics of procurement
   policies: A malaysian case study
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB This article examines efforts to create binding international rules regulating public procurement and considers, in particular, the failure to reach a WTO agreement oil transparency in government procurement. The particular focus of the discussion is the approach taken by Malaysia to these international procurement rules and to the negotiation of an agreement on transparency. Rules governing public procurement directly implicate fundamental arrangements of authority amongst and between different parts of government, its citizens and non-citizens. At the same time, the rules touch upon areas that are particularly sensitive for some developing countries. Many governments use preferences in public procurement to accomplish important redistributive and developmental goals. Malaysia has long used significant preferences in public procurement to further sensitive developmental policies targeted at improving the economic strength of native Malays. Malaysia also has political and legal arrangements substantially at odds with fundamental elements of proposed global public procurement rules. Malaysia has, therefore, been forceful in resisting being bound by international public procurement rules, and has played all important role in defeating the proposed agreement oil transparency. We suggest that our case study has implications beyond procurement. The development of international public procurement rules appears to be guided by many of the same values that guide the broader effort to create a global administrative law. This case study, therefore, has implications for the broader exploration of these efforts to develop a global administrative law, in particular the relationship between such efforts and the interests of developing countries.

TI Anti-WTO movement in Hong Kong - The 'battle of Hong Kong' and
   implications for Asian social movements
SO INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES
AB The Hong Kong Declaration, which came out of the WTO ministerial that was held in Hong Kong from 13th to 18th December 2005, was a victorious outcome for transnational corporations and the major powers. They gained successes in all negotiations-services, Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) and even in agriculture-although governments and neoliberal pundits declare otherwise. Initially the WTO secretariat and developed countries such as US and EU had downplayed the objective of the Hong Kong ministerial. However, with some concessions from major developing countries such as Brazil and India, the WTO was able come to such conclusions. This is a reflection of the fact that developing countries are becoming more immersed in the neoliberal economic order. On the other hand, global social movements, led by 1500 Koreans, were active from 11th December until the end of the ministerial and even beyond, in mobilizing protests and other anti-WTO activities. Although movements failed to 'derail' the ministerial, they were also successful in many ways. First of all, they gained worldwide attention through militant and diverse non-violent activities. In addition, Asian movements were able to strengthen regional solidarity from the various joint activities conducted in Hong Kong. Also because Asian movements were in the forefront, they rose to become a very important part of the global movement against imperialism and neoliberal globalization. just as Asian economies come to play a larger role in the global order, Asian movements also need to exert themselves into a more prominent role in the continuing struggle against the WTO and the neoliberal regime.

AB This article argues that Article XXIV and special and differential treatment (SDT) provisions of the WTO present a number of constraints and opportunities to the design and scope of the proposed economic partnership agreements between the European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. It examines the negotiating positions of both sides to argue that were the EU's position to prevail, ACP and other developing countries would likely suffer an 'erosion of the development principles' embedded within the WTO. It is shown that the differences between the two groups over the desirability and/or applicability of negotiating free trade agreements between developed and developing countries under the 'strict' jurisdiction of Article XXIV, and of negotiating agreements on services and the 'Singapore Issues', amount to a contestation over the principles of reciprocity and SDT within the WTO, and of the scope of the WTO.

TI Patents and Public Health in the WTO, FTAs and Beyond: Tension and
   Conflict in International Law
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB By mandating patent protection for pharmaceutical products, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) creates difficulties for developing countries seeking to import medicines to deal with serious public health concerns. In 2001, WTO Members began working towards a solution to this problem. Their work led to a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations and a proposal for a formal amendment of the TRIPS Agreement. However, the waiver remains underutilized and the amendment still lacks the necessary support of WTO Members for it to come into effect, suggesting that Members need to re-evaluate their commitment to affordable medicines while testing the workability of the waiver before snaking it permanent. Moreover, the potential of bilateral approaches to the problem of access to medicines for developing countries in the context of international trade is not being realized. On the contrary, preferential trade agreements concluded with the United States (US), in particular, are extending patent protection and diminishing flexibilities available under the TRIPS Agreement to address public health concerns. A pattern of contradictions exists between the WTO rhetoric on the one hand and Members domestic frameworks, bilateral agreements, and unilateral actions on the other. When it conies to attaining a coherent approach under international law towards reconciling patents and public health, the outlook is bleak.

TI Special and Differential Treatment in the Multilateral Trading System
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Special and differential treatment (S&DT) provisions relate to developing and least developed members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The effectiveness of S&DT provisions is important because they (1) address asymmetries between members and (2) give the WTO a global character, i.e. it is perceived as catering to the interests of all its members. Have these provisions been effective? Not really. This is mainly because these provisions are nonbinding, ambiguous, unstructured and lack connectivity with each other. Developing countries claim they are best endeavour clauses and unrealistic. So how can these provisions be made effective? This article examines the concept of S&DT including its history, reasons behind its introduction and continuation, its merits and demerits, reasons for its success and failure, its jurisprudence, and provides suggestions for improvement.

TI The evolution of the Jordanian TRIPS-Plus model: Multilateralism versus
   bilateralism and the implications for the Jordanian IPRs regime
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB This paper provides a brief preview of the historical development of intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection in Jordan. It examines the country's accession to the WTO and the emergence of the Jordanian TRIPS-plus model and its implications as envisioned under the recent Bilateral Free Trade and Investment Agreements with the USA and the EU. The paper argues that pressuring developing countries, including Jordan, to implement further levels of IPRs protection without the adaptation of a clear national development agenda outside the ambit of the WTO will have negative consequences for both developed and developing countries and for the multilateral trading system as a whole.

TI Using international institutions to improve public procurement
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
AB The World Trade Organization's voluntary rules on government procurement are a useful mechanism for ensuring that public procurement procedures are efficient. They also provide an opportunity to reduce the uncertainty of participants by increasing transparency and accountability. Yet most developing countries have chosen not to subject their procurement policies to international disciplines and multilateral surveillance. Their reasons may include an unfamiliarity with the government procurement agreement (GPA); a perception that the potential payoffs are small: a desire to discriminate in favor of domestic firms; or the successful opposition of groups that benefit from the current regimes. Although the economic rationales for abstaining from the GPA are not compelling, a quid pro quo for accession may be needed to oversome opposition by special interests. Developing country procurement markets due large enough that governments may be able to make accession to the GPA conditional On temporary exceptions to multilateral disciplines or on better access to export markets.

AB This paper examines the effect of trade policy space on production diversification, and particularly on industrialization. We define trade policy space as the extent of constraints imposed by non-trade obligations, and possibly bilateral and regional trade agreements on the current trade policy stance. Thus, the lower the extent of these constraints, the higher is the available trade policy space to promote production diversification and particularly on industrialization. The empirical analysis uses a sample of 159 countries, over the period 1995-2015, and shows that trade policy space is conducive to production diversification and industrialization, although the effect could vary across sub-samples.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB What opportunities does the World Trade Organisation (WTO) offer for the representation of transnational envirommental concerns by non-governmental organisations (NGOs)? Even prior to the Seattle protests in 1999, social movement pressure prompted WTO to increase its engagement with civil society groups, derestrict documents, facilitate NGO-oriented symposia and briefings, and extend access to ministerial meetings. A survey of NGO participants in recent WTO environment briefings reveals their positions on current and proposed modes of civil society input, the feasibility and legitimacy of which are discussed. Their recent coalition-building with development NGOs on specific trade campaigns is evidence that transnational environmental NGOs have grasped the need to appeal to developing country interests in order to widen political support for ecological concerns within the WTO.

AB The Doha Round of trade talks was suspended following the inability of the key players to find a mutually satisfactory agreement. One contributory factor to the problems the negotiations have faced has been the significant improvement in developing countries' awareness of the costs and benefits of the offers being made, as a result of a huge expansion in the availability of economic analyses being performed by a diverse array of agencies, much of it focused specifically on the effects on developing countries. While in the Uruguay Round and before many developing countries had little understanding of what the various agreements entailed, this is no longer the case. As a consequence, the EU and the United States have been unable to force through a bilaterally agreed deal, as was the usual practice in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds.

TI Reconstituting the 'Third World'? Poverty reduction and territoriality
   in the global politics of development
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB This article explores the relationship between the Politics of international development and the reproduction of global inequality. I argue that contemporary discourses about- and the practices of-'development for developing countries' represent an attempt to reconstitute the political utility of the 'Third World'. In an era of globalisation the deployment of the notion of a Third World of 'developing countries' which require immediate, systemic attention through the discourse and practice of international development continues to provide a way of both disciplining and displacing the global dimension of social and political struggle. I refer to this dynamic in terms of the political utility of the Third World, which, I argue, has been conducive to the organisation of global capitalism and the management of social and political contradictions of inequality and poverty. I develop this argument by drawing on the historical implications and legacy of 'international development' as practised in and on the Third World and through a critical analysis of the methodological premises that constitute international development. I illustrate this by drawing on a key strategy aimed ostensibly at development: the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) approach, promulgated by the World Bank and the IMF, which I discuss in relation to the 'development agenda' inaugurated during the 1999 WTO meeting in Doha (Qatar). I argue that the ideology and practice of the global politics of international development reinforce the conditions of global inequality,, and must be transcended as both an analytical framework and an organising principle of world politics. While the PRSP and related approaches are currently presented as key elements in the building of the 'architecture for (international) development', what is emerging is a form of governance that attempts to foreclose social and political alternatives.

SO EKONOMIKA REGIONA-ECONOMY OF REGION
AB In the article, the results of the research dedicated to the probable consequences of Russian entry to WTO are represented. Based on the analysis of the opposite points of view, it is shown that changes depend more on the economic situation in the country and not on the entry itself. The series of negative starting characteristics of Russian economy is noticed. Among those are the significant spatial differentiation of particular regions and the disproportion of the regional development. It also noted that Russian entry to WTO may deepen this disproportion. The prognosis of economic structural changes is proposed to implement in the two fields: in the traditional economic sector and the field of the knowledge-based economy. The method was developed for determining the first field of prognosis, which approbation confirmed the probable declining trend in traditional economic sectors. The task considering the second field was solved on the basis of the research in technology and innovation capital transformation processes on the example of two groups of countries: already WTO members but still developing countries and developing countries beyond WTO. The results of the research show the WTO entry neutral influence on structural changes in the knowledge-based economy.

SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LAW REVIEW
AB The wto has become one of the key international organisations responsible for regulating international economic relations among states. At first glance, the wto Agreement makes very democratic provisions with respect to decision-making. All formal wto decision-making organs are open to all members. Independent of population size, economic might or contribution to international trade, each member of the wto wields a single unweighted vote-i.e., 'one member, one vote'. Thus, at the formal level, all appears to bode well with the wto decision-making process. This seeming wellbeing, however, belies the true nature of the problems and challenges the decisionmaking process is encumbered with. This article undertakes analytical exegesis of the provisions on decision-making in Articles ix and x of the wto Agreement. The article also explores possible options for reforming the wto decision-making process and its implications for developing countries.

TI Participation Constraints in the WTO Dispute Settlement: Considering

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB This study examines participation constraints faced by developing countries and the impact of wealth and power (the power hypothesis) or economic and legal capacity (the capacity hypothesis) of a Member State on its decision to file a legal complaint against a specific other member at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Empirical research of 486 WTO disputes filed between 1995 and 2014 indicates that legal capacity matters more than power considerations in the WTO members' legal dispute settlements. This study is based on the premise that Kazakhstan does best when using the WTO dispute settlement system (after its accession to the WTO) against its main trading partners. Moreover, it attempts to predict the maximum gross domestic product (GDP) levels of Kazakhstan's potential defendants. The main findings are that under the legal capacity theory, Kazakhstan's economic features (such as GDP per capita, international trade position, government efficiency, military and non-military government spending, and others) are sufficient to proceed with legal claims against the Netherlands, Austria, Romania, Portugal, and Belarus.

TI Brazil's implementation of TRIPS flexibilities: ambitious missions,
   early implementation, and the plans for reform
SO INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW
AB The flexibilities introduced in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement were aimed at providing the developing countries with the option to adopt suitable measures to address access to patent-protected pharmaceutical products. The flexibilities include the grant of compulsory licences, exceptions to the exclusive right conferred by patent, allowing for parallel imports, and defining the criteria of patentability to achieve the goal of public health. While these flexibilities are available to all developing countries, only a few have implemented the flexibilities into their patent legislation. This paper examines the TRIPS compliant patent laws introduced in Brazil in the post-TRIPS era. It will be argued that the TRIPS Agreement was implemented too soon in Brazil, and the TRIPS flexibilities, although available had not been fully utilised due to pressure from transnational pharmaceutical corporations backed by developed countries, fear of exclusion from major trading blocs, and also due to a gap in the knowledge economy. It will also be argued that the World Trade Organization did not create a level playing field in the TRIPS negotiation in the lead up to the entry into force of the Agreement in 1995, which effectively handed over the advantage to the developed countries, thereby creating a two-tier system in the intellectual property rights arena and making it impossible for developing countries and least-developed countries to achieve the objective of access to affordable medicines.

TI Duration of the Membership in the World Trade Organization and Aid for
   Trade Flows
SO ECONOMIES
AB In examining the effect of membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the amounts of Aid for Trade (AfT) that accrue to developing countries, Lee et al. (2015) (The World Economy, 38, 2015 and 1462) have found that developing country members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) received higher AfT flows than non-WTO developing members. The present paper deepens the analysis by Lee et al. (2015) by investigating the effect of the duration of WTO membership on the amounts of AfT flows that accrue to recipient countries. The duration of membership in the WTO captures both the membership in the WTO and the time spent by a country in the organization. The main argument in this analysis is that the duration of WTO membership matters more than the mere WTO membership for the degree of liberalization in AfT recipient countries' trade regimes and their participation in international trade, the latter being a critical determinant of the AfT flows supplied by donors. This analysis has relied on a panel dataset of 136 countries over the period from 2002 to 2019, and the two-step generalized method of moments estimator. It has established that countries receive higher AfT flows as their membership duration increases, and the amounts of these resource inflows increase as recipient countries further liberalize their trade regime and further participate in international trade. Additionally, the effect of the duration of WTO membership on total AfT flows depends on donor-countries' commercial self-interest in recipient countries, including the latter's economic growth performance and endowment in natural resources.

TI Special and Differential Treatment as If It Could Be Reformed
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The central question posed by the longstanding debate among World Trade Organization (WTO) Members over special and differential treatment (S & DT) is how best to address legitimate demands for differentiation. Should this be done by replacing the self-designation of development status by a set of objective metrics distinguishing different categories of WTO Members? Or should Members alternatively focus their efforts on addressing objectively assessed capacities and needs in a more customized manner and on a case by case and agreement-specific basis? This note's review of the S & DT debate suggests that rather than focusing on the divisive issue of development status, where prospects for consensus appear non-existent, WTO Members should design S & DT support focusing on objectively assessed negotiating and implementation needs to which targeted Aid for Trade would respond. A forward-looking approach to differ-entiation within the WTO requires that an altogether different narrative on trade and develop-ment take root in the organization, one that ascribes to trade (and to trade policy) a key supportive role in development trajectories. All too often, S & DT demands are formulated as if multilateral rules are inherently inimical to the development needs and aspirations of the world's poorest nations. The note advances several reform options in charting a forward-looking S & DT agenda.

TI The WTO legality of the EU's GSP plus arrangement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In EC-Tariff Preferences, the Appellate Body held that the WTO Enabling Clause permitted developed countries to grant better tariff treatment to some developing countries than to others, subject to certain conditions. It held further that these conditions were not met by the EU's so-called 'drugs arrangement', a system of additional preferences (normally duty free treatment) for certain countries which the EU had determined were in need of special tariff preferences, thanks to their involvement in combating the production and trafficking of narcotics. In response to this ruling, when the EU renewed its GSP programme in 2005, it replaced its drugs arrangement and two similar, though less generous, labour and environment arrangements with a new arrangement popularly known as the 'GSP+ arrangement'. Under this arrangement, additional tariff preferences (normally duty free treatment), were made available to developing countries committing to ratify and implement a list of human rights and good governance conventions. According to the EU, the GSP+ arrangement complies with the Appellate Body's interpretation of the Enabling Clause. This article argues that it does not. This is primarily because of the substantive criteria chosen by the EU to select GSP+ beneficiaries, which do not meet the Appellate Body's criteria for differential tariff treatment of developing countries. Second, it is because the EU's requirement that would-be beneficiaries must have applied by a certain date, replicates the problem of the 'closed list' of beneficiaries that was fatal to the earlier incarnation of the EU's GSP program. The article concludes with some suggestions for designing a GSP+ arrangement more likely to meet the Appellate Body's conditions than the EU's present arrangement.

Our empirical results show that IPR protection positively affects economic growth in developing countries by attracting foreign technology embodied in capital goods. In addition, a developing country's membership of the WTO promotes and encourages technology transfer through the liberalization of international trade.

Empirical results show that multilateral trade liberalisation is positively associated with export product diversification. However, less-developed economies experience a greater positive effect than relatively advanced economies. This analysis suggests that if trade tensions reduce cooperation on trade matters among World Trade Organization members, it may hinder export product diversification in developing countries, and the poorest countries might be the most adversely affected.

SP OECD
AB The current WTO round has been set in motion by recent negotiations in Doha, Qatar. Among the most contentious issues in that meeting, and probably over the course of the next round, is direct and indirect producer support for agricultural exporters in the North and forgone production, employment, and trading opportunities for farmers in the South. Our results indicate that real commitments to reduce agricultural support in high-income countries will induce substantial changes in world food prices, domestic agricultural rates of return and output, and dramatic shifts in agricultural trade patterns. Total trade expands and real output, wages, and incomes in developing countries, especially among the rural poor, increase substantially. In particular, rural incomes in low and middle income countries increase by over USD 60 billion, a figure that comfortably exceeds even the most ambitious goals for increased development assistance and a substantial savings to OECD taxpayers. At the same time, EU and Japanese agricultural exports fall sharply and their imports rise. Other OECD countries see more balanced aggregate trade growth, but a number of strategic sectors are still adversely affected. These factors are likely to complicate negotiations in the Doha Round significantly.

TI Unexpected Usage of Enabling Clause? Proliferation of Bilateral Trade
   Agreements in Asia
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB In forming Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), developing countries mainly have two legal options: GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause. The latter provision can be used when the RTA involves only developing countries. The way the Enabling Clause is used by developing countries in Asia is very different from other regions. Outside Asia, the Enabling Clause is usually used to form a plurilateral RTA that have an accession clause, which envisages gradual evolution into a (sub)region-wide cooperative agreement. In contrast, in Asia, developing counties started to use the Enabling Clause to sign bilateral RTAs after 2000. Such an innovative way of using the Enabling Clause is one of the contributory factors to the recent proliferation of RTAs in Asia. This paper also considers the implications of the proliferation of Enabling Clause-based RTAs to the ongoing policy discussions on the 'systemic issues' of RTAs at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

TI Alliances, market power, and postwar trade: explaining the GATT/WTO
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB This paper argues that testing the empirical implications of existing theories about institutions yields rich insights into the postwar trade regime. Market-failure theory predicts that the GATT/WTO will exert its strongest impact on trade between its largest member states. A theory based on security externalities implies that a sizeable expansion of trade will also occur between a subset of the contracting parties that alliance ties link. An analysis of the data shows that the evidence is consistent with both theories, making clear the value added of taking explicitly into account the economics and politics that motivated the establishment of the postwar regime and that governed its subsequent operation.

TI Economic liberalisation for high-tech industry development? Lessons from

   with the strategies of Korea and Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB This paper argues that China's response to economic liberalisation, which artificially focuses on promoting particular sizes of firms, cannot improve technological capabilities in the ICT manufacturing industry. Not only have historical and economic conditions created difficulties in adopting Korean and Taiwanese style policies, but also competitive ICT firms in the global economy are increasingly moving from manufacturing to innovation activities against a backdrop of increasing economic liberalisation. Given the WTO and ITA agreements, the main path which Korea and Taiwan employed is now unavailable. The government therefore should leave the size of firms to market forces.

TI Aid for Trade and the Liberalization of Trade
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative has gained much popularity since its launch at the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s Ministerial Conference in 2005, and there are ongoing discussions on its effectiveness and potential to improve the integration of developing countries (DCs) into the world economy. This article contributes to the debate by analysing AfT in a political economy context. We find that the delivery of AfT is a precondition for trade reform and trade-enhancing rule-making in DCs and may cushion adjustment problems to trade liberalization. Accordingly, AfT can be a catalyst of trade reforms domestically and internationally.

TI Globalization, inequality and social policy: China on the threshold of
   entry into the World Trade Organization
SO SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
AB Over the part twenty years, social researchers have had increasingly to turn from domestic to international and global perspectives in their efforts to account for growing levels of social inequality! and in their search for practical policy solutions. It is against this background that China's recent experience is to be appreciated. The combined programme of economic reform coupled with an open-door policy has achieved much, yet has been accompanied by marked increases in social inequality. Until recently, most expects seemed to believe this trend to be a mere transitional "by-product" of domestic economic reform. Further social reform, backed by sustained economic growth, would be sufficient to resolve the problem. However, the facts note suggest otherwise. Sustained economic growth and reform, especially from the later 1990s, has been accompanied by ever-rewidenig social inequality, with no signs of an end in sight. This is a critical period. China is now on the cue of entry into the WTO, with all the anxieties as well as rewards this signals for the Chinese people Against this background the present paper weighs up the likely impact of offering suggestions for international social policy advance both "longitudinal" (between developed and developing countries) and "latitudinal" (between developing countries in competition with each other). Only by means of such "joint efforts" might China hope to escape the "social protection dilemmas" associated with entry into the WTO.

TI Trade Measures for Regulating Transboundary Movement of Electronic Waste
SO UTRECHT JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW
AB International trade in used electrical and electronics equipment (UEEE) provides an avenue for socio-economic development in the developing world and also serves as a conduit for transboundary dumping of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) also referred to as electronic waste or e-waste. The latter problem arises from the absence of a regulatory framework for differentiating between functional UEEE and junk e-waste. This has resulted in both functional UEEE and junk e-waste being concurrently shipped to developing countries under the guise of international trade in used electronics.
   Dealing with these problems will require effective regulation of international trade in UEEE from both exporting and importing countries. Although, the export of e-waste from the European Community to developing countries is currently prohibited, significant amounts of e-waste from the region continue to flow into developing countries due to lax regulatory measures in the latter. Hence, there is a need for a regulatory regime in developing countries to complement the prohibitive regime in the major e-waste source countries. This paper proposes trade measures modelled in line with WTO rules that could be adopted by developing countries in addressing these problems. The proposed measures include the development of a compulsory certification and labelling system for functional UEEE as well as trade ban on commercial importation of UEEE not complying with the said certification and labelling system. The paper then goes further to examine these proposed measures in the light of WTO rules and jurisprudence.

The focus of the study is on the WTO Agriculture and Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) modalities negotiations ether the G4 Potsdam collapse in June 2007 to the July 2008 G7 ministerial meetings. The analysis focuses on the role of the chair of NAMA in biasing the outcomes against the developing countries. The NAMA chair's role is contrasted with that of the Agriculture chair's snore inclusive and bottom-up process. The paper offers some tentative proposals that could foster a more efficient and balanced outcome in future WTO negotiations.

TI Impediments to global surveillance of infectious diseases: consequences
   of open reporting in a global economy
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Globalization has led to an increase in the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. international efforts are being launched to control their dissemination through global surveillance, a major hindrance to which is the failure of some countries to report outbreaks. Current guidelines and regulations on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases do not sufficiently take into account the fact that when developing countries report outbreaks they often derive few benefits and suffer disproportionately heavy social and economic consequences.
   In order to facilitate full participation in global surveillance by developing countries there should be: better and more affordable diagnostic capabilities to allow for timely and accurate information to be delivered in an open and transparent fashion; accurate, less sensationalist news reporting of outbreaks of diseases; adherence by countries to international regulations, including those of the World Trade Organization and the International Health Regulations; financial support for countries that are economically damaged by the diseases in question.
   The article presents two cases - plague in India and cholera in Peru - that illuminate some of the limitations of current practices. Recommendations are made on measures that could be taken by WHO and the world community to make global surveillance acceptable.

SO WTO LAW AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB The aim of this paper is to analyze developing countries' participation thus far in the current round of services negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda. The chapter analyzes developing countries' negotiating positions, as evidenced by their multilateral negotiating proposals; their initial offers; and, to the extent allowed by the incomplete and sketchy information available, their participation in bilateral market access negotiations. Several basic themes are raised: the essential role of services for economic development, the high costs imposed by trade protection, the benefits of liberalization, the need to make use of the WTO forum to enhance credibility and sustain domestic regulatory reform programs, the challenges of regulatory reform and the importance of appropriate sequencing, and the benefits arising from seeking further market access overseas in those areas in which developing countries have a comparative advantage.

AB Global trade liberalization, promoted by GATT/WTO, stimulated major world economies to extensively cut their average tariff levels through a number of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. However, simultaneously with the reduction of tariffs and in order to protect their national interests in the changing global environment, member states adjusted their trade policies toward a more frequent application of trade remedies. In this paper, the authors empirically examined the actual imposition cases of trade remedies by Japan. The study results demonstrate that anti-dumping duties are the most frequently applied trade remedies administrated on intermediate products, primarily from developing countries (China, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Pakistan). However, the number of these measures actually imposed by Japan is not comparable with the frequency of similar measures initiated against Japanese exporters abroad. Actual imposition cases of countervailing duties and safeguards remain low, nevertheless Japan shows concerns regarding the upward rising trend of safeguards in the world. The study conducted envisages a more frequent application of trade remedies by Japan due to the gradual increase in imports of manufactured goods from developing countries. The imports from the respective countries is expected to further expand in the context of a new strategic approach to emerging economies aiming at building new extensive networks of regional trade agreements as stipulated by the Strategy of the Global Outreach drafted by the Japanese government.

TI Is the dispute settlement system, "jewel in the WTO's crown", beyond
   reach of developing countries?
SO REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS
AB Since the inception of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995, member countries have been heavily relying on the organisation's Dispute Settlement System (DSS). Exploiting a new database on WTO litigations between 1995 and 2014, this paper describes disputes initiated over this period and identifies potential sources of bias concerning the participation of developing countries. The analysis builds on three different models to determine country i's probability of initiating a dispute against country j. Either it depends on the two countries' structure of trade (the rules-based model), or it is also affected by country i's or country j's specific characteristics (the unilateral power-based model), or it is also affected by bilateral economic and trade relations between countries i and j (the bilateral power-based model). We find that country i's structure of trade with j plays an important role in explaining the probability that i initiates a dispute against j under the DSS. We also find clear evidence with regard to the importance of two independent variables: first the legal capacity of i (a variable related to the unilateral power-based model) and second the trade retaliatory capacity of i against j (a variable related to the bilateral power-based). Almost all these results hold when testing for both the likelihood of initiating a dispute and for the number of disputes initiated before the WTO.

TI Capacity Constraint: A Fundamental Perspective for the Development Issue
   at WTO
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The development issue at WTO, which has generated heated academic and policy debates, is an integral part of the multilateral trade negotiations, with the special and differential treatment (S&DT) for developing countries being at the core. This article seeks to, by introducing certain theoretical analysis framework - such as the theory of 'incomplete contract' and 'poverty as capability deprivation' - into the multilateral trade negotiations, conclude that the fundamental aspect of the development issue at WTO is the capacity constraint of developing countries: the insufficient capacity limits the extent of their capability to negotiate internationally as well as to transform the negotiated outcomes into domestic economic development. Reviewing the capacity constraint and an array of economic and social indicators, it argues that China is still a developing country. Further, one of the important aspects for the multilateral trade negotiations on development lies in abridging the 'rules deficit', focusing on empowering and strengthening endogenous capabilities of developing countries. Meanwhile, the capacity constraint of developing countries stems from the past negotiations of multilateral trade rules and is reflected in the implementation of those rules, i. e., to transform multilateral trade rules into domestic laws and regulations, and further convert such capacity into a driving force and endogenous engine for domestic economic and social development. Thereafter, in the multilateral trade negotiations, developing countries may, on a voluntary basis, duly contribute according to their capacity to do so, which may be the way out for development negotiations at WTO.

Data were collected from various secondary sources and data is analyzed by using SPSS-20 version statistical software. It was revealed that WTO more industrialized countries consented to export fewer textiles while less industrialized countries enjoyed increased quotas for exporting their textiles(1). Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA(2) because it was expected to face more competition, particularly from China(3), it has tried to maintain its competitiveness in the post-quota era. It was further revealed that It has also been examined that all over the world textile industries are facing high inflation which is the hottest issue due to which the cost of doing business is going higher and higher day by day. The Chinese, Indian, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi textile manufacturers are also out of those affected ones whose major issues are associated with increased cost of production. China's dominance of the global garments trade has also been affected due to the rise in the costs of material, labour, energy, environmental protection and high interest rate. Furthermore, the environmental standard is also a barrier to many Chinese enterprises; even most of the Chinese enterprises have inputted environmental Standard.

TI A decomposition method on employment and wage discrimination and its
   application in urban China (2002-2013)
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Labor market discrimination is an important issue in developing countries where path-dependent institutions have been dominant, while effective institutional arrangements and policies have been hidden by local customs and culture. However, the existing applications of classical Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition face criticism for their imprecise understanding of the factors affecting institutional discrimination in labor markets, as well as for their lack of power in formulating well-targeted anti-discrimination policies. Following Oaxaca (1973), we propose a new method to decompose the total discrimination index (TDI) to analyze employment and wage discrimination in the labor markets of developing countries. The TDI is decomposed into the employment discrimination index (EDI) and the wage discrimination index (WDI), then into the underpayment index to majorities (UPI) and the overpayment index to minorities (OPI). We apply this method to the institutional discrimination against rural migrants in China's urban areas. Using national representative data from 2002 to 2013, we have found that, 1) the TDI increased quickly after China entered the WTO, then dropped after anti-discrimination policies were implemented. 2) The TDI is mainly determined by the UPI, while the TDI's fluctuation is mainly determined by the WDI. Our method provides insights into the changing composition of employment and wage discrimination and their respective labor market outcomes in developing countries. As a result, appropriate policy measures may be developed accordingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Indonesia as a signatory member of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Indonesia has enacted Law No. 31 of 2000 concerning Industrial Design on 20 December 2000. Since the enactment of Law No. 31 of 2000 several cases have occurred and been brought before the Commercial Court involving the cancellation of lawsuits with regard to issues of the lack of 'novelty' of an industrial design which have already been granted to other people. There are several weak aspects of Law No. 31 of 2000 which in practice can create legal uncertainty and may potentially cause a barrier towards the effectiveness of the implementation of Law No. 31 of 2000.

TI Titanic FTAs: Is it Time to Establish a Pan-Asian FTA?
SO MARGIN-JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB There seems to be no conclusive note on strengthening multilateralism except for the lip service generally paid by the World Trade Organization (WTO) members during their meetings, only to go back and get increasingly involved in their respective regional pursuits. The success of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) in the Hong Kong Ministerial is crucial for the future growth of the developing countries as well as for good future economic prospects for the developed countries. In case the Asian developing countries would like to adopt a dual strategy of mix of regionalism and multilateralism, they need to adopt a careful approach while treading this path. Small and narrow regional trade agreements (RTAs) can be costly as well as trade diverting. Larger and broader RTAs may be a better option. A Pan-Asian Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA) may be an appropriate response to the Enlarged European Union (EEU) and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Open regionalism through autonomous liberalisation within a pre-fixed period of time is a better option for PAFTA than preferential trade liberalisation.

SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB Current negotiations of the WTO's Doha Development Agenda include proposals for an agricultural special safeguard policy. The Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) under consideration would allow developing countries to invoke additional duties if import quantities rise above or import prices fall below specific trigger levels. We show that a global excess supply shock for a given agricultural commodity is ambiguous in terms of triggering a quantity-or price-based SSM. Using wheat and maize trade data, we show that a global excess supply shock may trigger a Q-SSM for one country and a P-SSM for another. We also provide threshold levels for the magnitude of shocks that would cause the P-SSM or Q-SSM to bind for various countries.

AB The current United States Administration will face considerable challenges in the key areas of international trade law and policy. In order to understand the future international trade architecture for the coming decade, including in the World Trade Organization (WTO), it is essential to understand the drivers of key trade strategies in leading economies. This article explains the reasons why and the extent to which the negotiating perspective of a country is determined by its ability to penetrate in global value chains, embrace tariff reforms, and face the trade balance consequences. These abilities may in turn influence a country's willingness to impose anti-dumping or subsidies and countervailing measures. Given the employment generation capability of the manufacturing sector and the consequent domestic economic compulsions, the WTO negotiations on freeing trade in this category have progressed slowly. The Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) negotiations to reduce the high bound tariff to address tariff "overhang" reached a stalemate in the last decade due to diverging perspectives of developed and developing countries. In addition, developed countries have ceased using contingency measures as policy instruments, and leading developing countries are taking refuge by doing the same. In this context, this article explores the tariff and contingency policies of two key developed countries (United States and European Union) and developing countries (China and India), to gauge each country's willingness for future reforms. The perspective regarding manufacturing competitiveness differs significantly among these countries, which also shapes their manufacturing policy interventions. This article concludes that, given the trade and industrial policy choices made by these countries in recent past, it would be difficult to reach a WTO-induced multilateral trade agreement on NAMA.

TI Trade and environment negotiations in the WTO: Asian perspectives
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB For developing countries, aid cannot replace trade. Mutually supportive trade and environmental policies should contribute to the realization of sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to identify the negotiating position of selected Asian developing countries on the World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE). This paper reviews their submissions and suggestions for the CTE with regard to its mandate on trade and environment. In addition, using key trade statistics, it explores the relationship between their negotiating positions and changes in the structure of international trade in Asia. While the CTE has brought about no specific results concerning its mandate, the negotiating positions of developing countries are changing sharply. In particular, Asian developing countries now participate proactively in CTE negotiations. This paper shows the diversity of views held by Asian countries on trade and environment. In some cases, their views are opposed to each other. It can also be observed that the negotiating position of each Asian country at the CTE is closely related to its own trade structure. In accordance with national patterns of trade structure, NIEs, China and India have their own distinct negotiating positions whereas Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries have not taken the same stance in the CTE negotiations. Each member of ASEAN presents separate views depending on the nature of the issue.

TI Neoliberalism as a class ideology; Or, the political causes of the
   growth of inequalities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB Neoliberalism is the dominant ideology permeating the public policies of many governments in developed and developing countries and of international agencies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, and many technical agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization. This ideology postulates that the reduction of state interventions in economic and social activities and the deregulation of labor and financial markets, as well as of commerce and investments, have liberated the enormous potential of capitalism to create an unprecedented era of social well-being in the world's population. This article questions each of the theses that support such ideology, presenting empirical information that challenges them. The author also describes how the application of these neoliberal policies has been responsible for a substantial growth of social inequalities within the countries where such policies have been applied, as well as among countries. The major beneficiaries of these policies are the dominant classes of both the developed and the developing countries, which have established worldwide class alliances that are primarily responsible for the promotion of neoliberalism.

TI LEGAL FRAGMENTATION AND ASYMMETRIES IN THE WTO: SPAGHETTI BOWL OR POLICY
   SPACE?
SO REVISTA DIREITO GV
AB This paper addresses the issue of asymmetries in the multilateral trading system under the theoretical debate of fragmentation of the international law. In this sense, in the scope of the international trade law, the Spaghetti Bowl image is famous by calling the attention to the risks encompassed by the " tangle of norms"; a labyrinth of crossed preferences and potential conflicts of norms and jurisdictions. Nevertheless, although the increasing fragmentation raises challenges of measuring systemic impact of agreements, balance trade-offs, rights and obligations among different commitments, it also opens policy spaces, mostly for developing countries. This article analyzes the trend of rules fragmentation within the Special and Differential Treatment (S& DT), since the creation of the WTO. The purpose is to prove that the S& DT reflects also the use of rooms for manoeuvre by developing countries, while contributing to an increasingly fragmentation of the rules in the multilateral trading system, highlighting thus the strategic dimension of fragmentation.

TI Broadening the conversation on the TRIPS agreement: Access to medicines
   includes addressing access to medical devices
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Patent laws determine access to medicines and medical devices, and all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are obligated to introduce minimum standards of intellectual-property protection into their national patent laws. In the negotiations that led up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), in 2016, the United States attempted to introduce patents for diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods to promote the interests of its pharmaceutical and medical-device industries. These attempts were unsuccessful; however, these actions demonstrate the determination of those who advocate for higher standards of intellectual-property protection to push for a TRIPS-plus agenda. The United States has sought to limit the use of flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, including the use of compulsory licenses which allows the generic industry to produce cheaper pharmaceuticals. Despite these US actions, many developing countries are becoming emboldened and are issuing compulsory licenses. The position of this paper is to show that, while access to pharmaceuticals and the ability to issue compulsory licenses is crucial to administering proper health care to people living in developing countries, medical devices are equally essential. Therefore, the conversation around access to medicines should be broadened to include access to medical devices in developing countries.

TI Evolution of the Generalized Scheme of Preferences
SO REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES
AB Introduction. The revision of the old U.S. rules of assigning developing country status under the law of countervailing duties in 2020 theoretically symbolizes another stage in the evolution of the Generalized Scheme of Preferences, but practically means a new form of battle for international competitiveness. There is no common criterion for determination of developing countries, either at the level of international organizations, including the World Trade Organization, or at the level of donor countries, while the list of least developed countries is determined by the United Nations, and they automatically become recipients of tariff preferences under the Generalized Scheme of Preferences. In this regard, the main idea and purpose of the study is to identify the applied aspects of the development of the international system of GSP and criteria for identifying developing countries to improve the system of tariff preferences EAEU and increase the competitiveness of goods produced in the domestic market.
   Materials and Methods. The paper reviews established rules within the GSP and features of the functioning of this system in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Britain and such integration groupings as the European Union, Commonwealth of Independent States and EAEU. To identify main aspects of this transformation it has been used the method of cross-country comparison, as well as methods of systematic and comparative analysis of relevant international and national legal acts and scientific papers.
   Results. We have revealed an international trend that is being formed by the leading economic actors to establish new rules for the functioning of the GSP and the criterion for determining the beneficiary countries. This trend will obviously affect the general rules of international trade within the framework of the World Trade Organization and to some extent will bring changes in its architecture.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The process of active unilateral revision of established for half a century international trade rules beyond the framework of international organizations gives to the problem a new systemic character and opens up an opportunity for future studies. It is obvious that we are on the beginning of entire international economic relations system transformation, which at the first stage will be accompanied by negative processes and will require an adequate response from the Russian state authorities, coordinating bodies of the EAEU and interested major economic agents.

TI Determinants of Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Asian
   Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB In the knowledge economy, intangible assets and intellectual property rights are increasingly recognized as a substance of competencies. As an emerging market of the world, Asian developing countries experience various issues related to intellectual property rights protection. Meanwhile, the current literature on intellectual property rights with an emphasis placed on Asia is quite scarce. Therefore, this study explores the determinants of the strength of intellectual property rights in 25 Asian developing countries during the 11-year period from 2006 to 2016. Using the fixed effects model (FEM) and random effects model (REM) with the Hausman test, the paper discovers the positive impacts of economic growth, trade openness, and WTO participation on the protection level of intellectual property rights. Unexpectedly, education is a negative determinant of intellectual property rights protection. This study aims to demonstrate the overall status quos of intellectual property rights regimes across Asian developing countries, so provide an important theoretical background for innovators, governments, and policymakers to design optimal intellectual property rights strategies.

TI Landlocked or Policy-locked? The WTO Review of Nepal's Trade Policy
SO GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Located between India and China-emerging powerhouses-Nepal is a landlocked country. Despite its strategic location, Nepal's growth performance so far has been disappointingly slow. It has not yet fully adhered to the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and regulations, and it faces several challenges relating to prudential macroeconomic policies, governance and infrastructure. It is increasingly evident that Nepal's own policies and practices are the root cause of its lacklustre growth performance despite its strategic location between two emerging powerhouses, with preferential access to many high-income economies. However, Trade Policy Review: Nepal 2018 by the WTO is disappointingly polite in discussing these challenges and policy shortcomings, which should have been the left, right and centre of the report. Despite these shortcomings, its publication is very timely, given the current policy debate on the problems of landlocked developing countries.

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The European Communities (EC) has developed a Generalized System of Preferences (GSO, inchedin g the 'Special Incentives for Sustainable Development and Good Governance', also known as GSP+. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) law, GSPs are generally authorized by the Enabling Clause, allowing developed countries to grant trade preferences to the advantage of developing countries on a non-reciprocal basis. However, trade negotiations and disputes pertaining to these preferences have been some of the most difficult and acrimonious. This article argues that the GSP+ violates the most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle of Article 1:1 GATT and therefore is only compliant with WTO law if it can be justified on appropriate legal grounds.

TI Trade adjustment in the WTO system: are more safeguards the answer?
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB For countries to engage successfully in the international trading system, their industries, firms, and workers must respond continually to new conditions of competition. The continuing need to adjust arises both from policy changes approved in multilateral negotiationse.g. implementation of trade liberalization commitments, preference erosion, or adverse terms-of-trade consequences of export subsidy eliminationand from ongoing changes in competitive pressures inherent in a liberal trading systeme.g. effects on comparative advantage of changes in technology or factor supplies. But the political response to a situation calling for adjustment is often a call for safeguardswhether as an ex ante provision in negotiated agreements or as an ex post measure once the agreement has been signed and the reality of new conditions takes shape. This paper examines the range of adjustment problems confronting the current and future international trading system, the economic arguments for intervention to deal with these problems, the adjustment environment as set out in the current World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements, and proposals for reform. While the adjustment problems we discuss apply to both rich and poor WTO member countries, we highlight the issues of adjustment especially relevant for developing countries.

TI Reinventing the Development Wheel of the World Trading System (Reviewing
   Sonia E. Rolland, Development at the World Trade Organization (2012))
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In probing how WTO norms may affect developing countries, Sonia Rolland introduces two paradigms in this book: development as an idiosyncrasy and development as a normative co-constituent to trade. The first paradigm concerns development-related exceptions and carve-outs found within WTO rules and agreements that exemplify a contingent provision of special favors to developing countries. Overall, it represents a limited mandate on development in the WTO. In contrast, the second paradigm embodies a normative operationalization of development agenda within the WTO system. It normatively reconstructs WTO rules and institutions in a way where development is a core mandate of the WTO, on par with free trade. In her reform proposals, the author reveals a subterranean advocacy of a shift from the first to second paradigm. The author offers a rare in-depth account of the past, present, and future of development in the world trading system. This Review Essay complements the author s ambitious project by locating some missing pieces of this grand puzzle of trade and development, such as general trade rules and disciplines.

TI Trans-Pacific Tariff Barriers: a Case Study of Five Asia-Pacific
   Developing Countries and Canada
SO CHINA ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB Though the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is believed to greatly benefit the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific (AP) region, most of the countries, such as China, are still hesitant to join. The major concern for these countries is whether or not the gains from the free trade provisions of the TPP will provide enough of an advantage given that most of them have already joined the WTO. In this paper, I first apply Feenstra's (1995) TRI to gauge the actual Canadian tariff barriers facing five Asia-Pacific developing countries: China, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The calculation of TRIs enables us to estimate the gains (from retrieving deadweight loss due to tariff distortion) to Canada if it completely removes its tariff barriers from the 2010 level against the five exporting countries. The gains for Canada would reach USD 276.45 million solely from China's exports, and another USD 33.96 million total from the four other countries. Then, based on the gravity model, I estimate the impact of tariff reduction on imports and the gains, in terms of possible export growth, to the five developing countries. I find China's exports to Canada may increase by 60.58%. Export growth then would be 68.21% for Indonesia, 39.77% for Malaysia, 69.64% for the Philippines, and 42.62% for Thailand.

TI Political-economic problems in trade capacity building
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Theoretically, trade capacity building should contribute to exportled growth and support liberal economic policies. Unfortunately, it often fails to meet this ideal due to resource misallocation, misplaced focus on existing obligations, and donor-driven implementation. This article presents a formal theory of political-economic problems in trade capacity building. I analyze trade liberalization as a repeated game with imperfect public monitoring between a developed and developing country. Modeling trade capacity building as an investment by the developed country, I show that it suffers from two problems. First, the need to enforce trade liberalization drives resource misallocation: costly projects are implemented only to build commitment capacity while others are not implemented because they encourage protectionism. Second, donor interests distort trade capacity building. Counterintuitively, if the donor can seek compensation from the recipient when it violates international trade law, it sometimes refuses to invest in low-cost trade capacity building while funding projects that hurt the recipient.

Using conditional difference-in-differences estimation, we find unambiguous evidence that stronger IP rights spur FDI inflows. Further, this response is heterogenous across countries and time. Whereas the effect of a unit increase in IP protection on the percentage increase in FDI$$ FDI $$ inflows remains about 0.50 for countries with small magnitudes of knowledge assets (roughly 15 'international patents'), it declines to about 0.25 for countries with larger knowledge capital (say, 5000 'international patents'). The results are robust to numerous robustness checks.

AB This paper examines the relationship between the wealth and power of states and their ability to participate fully within the World Trade Organization's system of dispute resolution. Two alternative hypotheses are considered. The power hypothesis predicts that politically weak countries will refrain from filing complaints against politically powerful states for fear of costly retaliation. The capacity hypothesis predicts that low-income states will tend to complain about behavior by high-income states because the latter offer a higher expected return. We test these two hypotheses and find considerable support for the capacity hypothesis and no support for the power hypothesis. We conclude that poor states behave differently than their rich counterparts because they lack the financial, human, and institutional capital to participate fully in the dispute resolution system.

TI Trade Liberalization in Indonesian Health Services: Prospects and

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB The worldwide increase in demand for health services offers developing countries, like Indonesia, significant opportunities to expand international trade in this area. However, policy aimed at achieving this objective must carefully consider the World Trade Organization's (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). For signatory nations and those considering becoming signatory nations, the procedural, structural, and other effects of the GATS make it a formidable challenge for national health policy alongside its impact on trade liberalization. Invoking the four GATS health care trade modes, this article develops possible approaches to Indonesian health services in the context of trade liberalization.

TI Brazil's Role in Institutions of Global Economic Governance: The WTO and
   G20
SO GLOBAL SOCIETY
AB The article evaluates the extent to which Brazil's foreign policy actions, negotiating positions and diplomatic strategies in global governance institutions contribute to supporting its national interest and foreign policy aims. It compares Brazil's preferences and behaviour in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Group of 20 (G20). For decades, Brazil's primary national interest has been national economic development. The article argues that Brazil is moving from a material interests based definition of its prime national interest to a more complex one that includes both material and prestige/status based aspects. Research demonstrates that Brazil has become increasingly focused on gaining recognition as a leader of developing countries, sometimes even at the cost of realising its full material interests. It considers the value of constructivist international relations theory to understanding Brazilian foreign policy.

TI The politics behind the implementation of the WTO Paragraph 6 Decision
   in Canada to increase global drug access
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: The reform of pharmaceutical policy can often involve trade-offs between competing social and commercial goals. Canada's Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR), a legislative amendment that permits compulsory licensing for the production and export of medicines to developing countries, aimed to reconcile these goals. Since it was passed in 2004, only two orders of antiretroviral drugs, enough for 21,000 HIV/AIDS patients in Rwanda have been exported. Future use of the regime appears unlikely. This research aimed to examine the politics of CAMR.
   Methods: Parliamentary Committee hearing transcripts from CAMR's legislative development (2004) and legislative review (2007) were analysed using a content analysis technique to identify how stakeholders who participated in the debates framed the issues. These findings were subsequently analysed using a framework of framing, institutions and interests to determine how these three dimensions shaped CAMR.
   Results: In 2004, policy debates in Canada were dominated by two themes: intellectual property rights and the TRIPS Agreement. The right to medicines as a basic human right and CAMR's potential impact on innovation were hardly discussed. With the Departments of Industry Canada and International Trade as the lead institutions, the goals of protecting intellectual property and ensuring good trade relations with the United States appear to have taken priority over encouraging generic competition to achieve drug affordability. The result was a more limited interpretation of patent flexibilities under the WTO Paragraph 6 Decision. The most striking finding is the minimal discussion over the potential barriers developing country beneficiaries might face when attempting to use compulsory licensing, including their reluctance to use TRIPS flexibilities, their desire to pursue technological development and the constraints inherent in the WTO Paragraph 6 Decision. Instead, these issues were raised in 2007, which can be partly accounted for by experience in implementing the legislation and hence a greater representation of the interests of potential beneficiary country governments.
   Conclusions: The Canadian Government designed CAMR as a last resort measure. Increased input from the developing country beneficiaries and shifting to institutions where the right to health gets prioritized may lead to policies that better achieves affordable drug access.

TI Iraqi patent law - In search of compliance with TRIPS
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB 1994 was a watershed date for the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and for the World Trade Organization (WTO) - it was the year intellectual property was incorporated into the trading system. Developing countries were the real targets of TRIPS because they largely had only minimal or no intellectual property systems in place. For developing countries, TRIPS requires the adoption of an entirely new body of law, together with a framework to effectively enforce these new rights.
   Iraq is currently in the pipeline of acceding to the WTO. Thus, Iraq needs to develop a comprehensive strategy to implement TRIPS successfully and expeditiously, as envisaged by TRIPS. The goal of this article is to discuss Iraqi patent law and highlight the areas where it complies or does not comply with TRIPS. The article also provides a set of conclusions in order for Iraq to shore up its intellectual property regime.

TI Issues of Manufactures Liberalization and Administered Protection in the
   Doha Round
SO GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL
AB This article focuses especially on the positions that the developing countries should take in their own interests on the issues of manufactures liberalization and administered protection. A series of recommendations are set forth with supporting argument: (1-2) for market access, both developed and developing countries should commit to reducing their most restrictive trade barriers, using a formula approach with limited exceptions; (3) negotiated tariff reductions should be phased in over a period of ten years in equal incremental installments; (4) adjustment assistance should be provided by a system of wage insurance and subsidized by transfers from developed countries; (5) the rules for safeguards, countervailing duties, and anti-dumping should be redrafted to focus their use on cases of legitimate economic justification and to discourage their use as protectionist devices; (6) the U.S. and EU should devise and implement a program of comprehensive but declining import restrictions on imports from China consistent with China's terms of WTO accession and eliminated by 2008; (7) WTO rules governing Preferential Trading Arrangements should be revised to insure that they contribute to the liberalization and simplification of the multilateral trading system; (8) preference granting countries should provide assistance to countries experiencing the erosion of preferences due to multilateral liberalization; (9) the WTO system of dispute resolution should remain in place; and (10) special and differential assistance, if granted, should not exempt countries from the provisions for their own market liberalization.
   Developing countries should participate actively and constructively in the negotiations to further their own interests. Developing countries may be at a disadvantage in the negotiating process, due to their resource limitations and inexperience in negotiations. Offsetting such disadvantages, however, are their large numbers and the compelling case for meeting their needs. What is needed is leadership and cooperation as for example with the Group of 20 and other coalitions together with a willingness to listen and be flexible on the part of their developed country counterparts.

TI The Political Economy of WTO with Special Reference to NAMA Negotiations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB This article argues that difficulties in negotiations on Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) are rooted in the economic philosophy behind the design of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which suffer from double standards and asymmetries, as well as their lack of appropriate implementation by developed countries. The main cause of the bias against developing countries is the conflict of ideology/interests and imbalances in the power relationship between developing and developed countries inherited from the Bretton Woods System (which were in fact at odds with the proposals originally made by Keynes). Highlighting inconsistencies between the objectives/spirit of the agreed text of the Doha Round on NAMA and subsequent proposals made by developed countries, the article suggests that the agreement on these proposals would limit the policy space of developing countries, as many of them would be locked in production and exportation of primary commodities or, at best, resource-based and assembly operations. The article concludes by suggesting a number of potential changes to WTO rules that would render them more conducive to industrialization and development of developing countries.

TI Trade reforms and current account imbalances
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper studies the effects of trade liberalization on capital flows in a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model and makes four contributions. First, we identify an interest rate overdetermination problem in such a model, and solve it with an endogenous discount factor. Second, we show that a trade liberalization in a developing country generally leads to a greater current account surplus, which is the exact opposite of a common but partial equilibrium intuition. Third, factor market reforms reinforce the effect of the trade liberalization on capital outflows. Finally, our calibrations suggest that China's accession to the WTO is likely an important factor driving the rise of current account surplus during 2001-2010. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The WTO-SPS agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures requiring legislation to be based oh PRA and other criteria, forced a revision of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the development of international standards, These changes are discussed together with some of the challenges facing plant health organisations in this new millennium, such as the protection of the global environment, the further development of international standards, assistance to developing countries and the increasing need to take account of consumer concerns.

   2001
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing is one of the most significant outcomes of the Uruguay Round. While the ATC promises to deliver a significant amount of liberalization during the 1995 to 2004 transition period, trade policy analysts and developing country representatives have expressed concern about the role of ATC Article 6 safeguard provisions. This paper reviews the safeguard activity under the ATC during the 1995 to 2001 period. In earlier years, there is evidence of abuse of the mechanism by the United States, but in later years, the primary use of ATC safeguards has been by Latin American countries. Overall, the ATC safeguard provisions have proved to be effective both in limiting most safeguard abuses and in carving out a new textiles and clothing regime within the WTO.

TI Trading relations: is the roadmap from Lome to Cotonou correct?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB One of the reasons behind the re-negotiation of the Lome Convention, resulting in the Cotonou Agreement, was the alleged inability of the trade provisions of Lome to increase the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries' market share of the European Union (EU) market. The Cotonou Agreement may lead to the more advanced ACPs being granted future market access to the EU under a generalized system of preferences (GSP), in conformity with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. To this end, this paper makes a comparative analysis of the effects of the EU's Lome Convention and GSP on exports of developing countries using a gravity type of model. The results indicate positive and statistically significant export effects of the both the Lome Convention and the GSP. The export effects are greater in case of the Lome Convention throughout the study period running from 1973 to 1992. In addition, the paper illustrates the EU country distribution of the export effects and shows that Belgium and The Netherlands are the EU countries that most have increased their imports from the developing countries under both the Lome Convention and the GSP.

TI Overcoming the SPS concerns of the Bangladesh fisheries and aquaculture
   sector From compliance to engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the challenges developing countries face in attempting to balance sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) health and safety measures against concerns about protectionism, illustrated by the impact of trade barriers on the fisheries and aquaculture sector in Bangladesh. The paper then provides recommendations to overcome the effects of these trade barriers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author uses a close doctrinal approach for the first three parts of the paper by analysing the provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) SPS Agreement and the effect of those provisions in creating domestic compliance gaps in the Bangladeshi fisheries and aquaculture sector. A qualitative approach is then adopted in suggesting potential reforms and future directions to assist the Bangladeshi fisheries and aquaculture sector overcome SPS trade barrier issues.
   Findings - To overcome the market access issues created by SPS trade barriers, Bangladesh and other developing countries require multilateral assistance, accommodation by trading partners and internal reforms. This includes reforming internal governance structures, improving trade participation and negotiation, increasing infrastructure investment and learning from similar countries who have improved their supply chain management.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper will have significant implications by contributing to law and policy reform debates involving international trade law and domestic compliance gaps. It will also assist other developing countries that experience SPS trade barriers to learn from the experience of the Bangladeshi fisheries and aquaculture sector.
   Practical implications - This paper has practical implications by providing recommendations for how Bangladesh can overcome SPS trade barriers and improve its market access. This will help Bangladesh integrate into the global trading systemby enhancing its participation in the SPS framework.
   Social implications - By addressing and providing recommendations for the SPS trade barrier challenges faced by Bangladesh fishery and aquaculture sector, this paper provides a framework to improve the economic development and global competitiveness of the industry. This will contribute the gross domestic product growth and help increase the overall living standards of the people involved in the fisheries and aquaculture business in Bangladesh.
   Originality/value - This paper is an original work that has not been published elsewhere. It is the first time a paper has dealt with the legal, policy and compliance challenges faced by the fisheries and aquaculture sector in Bangladesh.

CY MAY 23-24, 2002
CL PARIS, FRANCE
SP OECD
AB Price transmission from the world to domestic markets is one of the key building blocks of global agricultural trade models designed to quantify the impact of trade liberalisation. It is in this context that this paper analyses price transmission mechanisms and draws some conclusions. First, there is some confusion on the usage of the term. Price transmission may be complete in an absolute sense but this is not equivalent to assuming a value of unity for the elasticity, which is, for full transmission, less than unity in the import case and greater than unity in the export case. Second, it is very unlikely that price transmission in real life even in an absolute sense is full or complete, for a number of reasons such as border and domestic policy interventions, non-competitive market structures and measurement errors. Third, the review of past studies as well as some fresh estimates for Asian cereal markets indicate that short-run transmission elasticities are more likely to be on the lower side, typically in the range of 0.2 to 0.4. Fourth, although the paper focuses on Asia, this conclusion applies to a majority of other developing countries too. Fifth, lack of sound analyses of the price transmission process for developing countries limits the ability of global trade models to quantify results on the impact of trade liberalisation on these economies. Finally, the paper discusses some trade policy issues, focussing on the role of the WTO bound tariff in price transmission. Until the time the developing countries are able to resort to other (and more efficient) instruments to safeguard the interest of producers and consumers, tariffs will continue to be used to respond to external price shocks and so price transmission will remain incomplete for some time.

TI The trade and development policy of the European Union
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB This article examines the EU's trade and development policy from the 1950s to the present day. From its origins in France's demand that the EEC join in its colonial enterprise, this policy has grown to embrace all developing countries in a complex patchwork of trade preferences. However, it would be wrong to see this status quo as the natural evolution of an early interest in assisting developing countries. Rather, the EU's system of trade preferences represents a compromise between its desire to protect the economic interests of the erstwhile colonies and the demands of non-privileged developing countries for improved access to European markets. From a development perspective, this produces anomalies. Even today, via more favourable rules of origin, Sudan trades on better terms with the EU than Laos. However, as this article seeks to demonstrate, due largely to enforceable WTO rules, the EU is now coming to adopt principle - the actual needs of developing countries - over history as the basis for its future trade and development policy.

SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the United Nations' least developed country (LDC) category in 2026. The graduation to developing country status will revive all the waived obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) regarding pharmaceutical patents from which Bangladesh was exempted as a member of the LDCs. During its time as an LDC, the Bangladesh government, although having a pre-existing patent regime, established a mailbox system storing pharmaceutical patent applications. Such establishment of a `mailbox' appears to be beyond the government's delegated legislative authority. Moreover, the government kept receiving such applications for the last one and half decades. This article explores the country's mailbox dilemma and the implications and challenges of its graduation to developing country status. To respond to such conundrums, this article lays down some immediate and long-term ways forward for the country to ensure access to medicines for its people, who continue to experience huge income inequality.

AB The Doha Work Programme of 1 August 2004 justifies hopes for a successful conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations in 2006/2007. Developing countries must exploit more actively the opportunities which the WTO offers for promoting economic welfare through trade liberalization and legal reforms. The decisions to phase-out export subsidies and to move forward with negotiations on trade facilitation will help the WTO to realize the 'development agenda' of the Doha Round. Additional commitments by advanced developing countries will be necessary for enabling industrial countries to remove some of their - for developing countries most damaging - market access restrictions. In order to deliver favourable results for developing countries, market liberalization commitments have to be supplemented by special and differential treatment and a large amount of non-discretionary technical assistance to aid implementation. The WTO also has to demonstrate to the US Congress that WTO negotiations and the domestic implementation of WTO dispute settlement rulings are worthwhile. The article discusses legal and institutional WTO reforms necessary for concluding the Doha Round.

TI Do WTO Commitments Restrict the Policy Space of Countries Wishing to
   Provide Food Security Through Stockholding Programs?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The use of administered prices to acquire public stockholdings for food security purposes has become contentious among WTO members. G-33 countries have proposed that existing limits be lifted while other WTO members have not acquiesced. This impasse has threatened the success of WTO Ministerial Meetings in both Bali and Nairobi. Currently, a Peace Clause pertaining to cases being brought to the disputes settlement system has been agreed while members seek a permanent solution. The debate over public stockholdings, however, is being conducted with limited information - in particular whether the WTO de minimis limits restrict the policy space for developing countries pursuing food security goals. This article examines the restrictiveness of the limits on G-33 countries. Using conservative assumptions, it finds that for high food security risk G-33 countries the current de minimis levels are constraining. They are less constraining on medium and low food security risk countries. As a result, the policy space for some developing countries is restricted. The results also suggest that the current 'one size fits all' limits may not be appropriate and could be replaced by a flexible system.

TI The impact of plurilateral trade agreements on developing countries - to
   participate or not to participate?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS-SAJIA
AB In the wake of the impasse in the Doha Development Round of multilateral trade talks, sector-specific plurilateral trade agreements (PTAs) have been gaining traction. However, PTAs mostly appeal to developed countries, with the uptake among developing countries (including least-developed countries) being very limited. This article investigates the factors contributing to such a phenomenon, whether there is indeed merit in developing countries playing a more active role in PTAs and how they might be encouraged to do so. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted with specific attention being given to the effects, on a selection of developing countries, of participation in four PTAs: the Trade in Services Agreement, the Government Procurement Agreement, the Environmental Goods Agreement and the Information Technology Agreement II. Among the findings was that although, according to the qualitative analysis, policymakers are generally disinterested in the four PTAs because they are not aligned to the countries' economic interests or they threaten policy space, the quantitative analysis revealed that gains could often be made from more active participation in these agreements. This clearly points to a research gap and highlights the need for more in-depth analysis of the potential of PTAs in the developing world.

TI BRICS: Advancing Cooperation and Strengthening Regionalism
SO INDIA QUARTERLY-A JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB In the era of regional international relations and more interdependence, organisations like the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) can play a meaningful role in international level as well as regional in years to come. The recent summit of the BRICS reiterates that more cooperation is needed at various levels. In Delhi declaration, it is called for a more representative international financial architecture, with an increase in the voice and representation of developing countries and the establishment and improvement of a just international monetary system that can serve the interests of all countries and support the development of emerging and developing economies. Moreover, these economies having experienced broad-based growth are now significant contributors to global recovery. This is true. One must acknowledge the fact that the roles of the BRICS countries are composed of various political systems, various subcontinent, but in the changed context, all these countries are coming under the purview of the 'developing countries' in broader terms. That makes the BRICS beyond the regional boundaries to set a benchmark in the regional cooperation. China's permanent status in the United Nations makes the BRICS more strategically oriented and pragmatic aspects of foreign policy engagement in the twenty-first century. The political leadership and vision is equally important with economic engagement. The four major theories of the international relations (IR) are striking in this respect which includes liberalism, realism, constructivism and Marxism. Theoretical framework relevant to regionalism in focusing on IR theories is also analysed in this article. The main argument of the article is that there is no prescribed regional model and BRICS has to tune to the member countries' regional and political frameworks to engage with. Therefore, the framework of analysis is more or less critical about the Western engagement and it is region focused.

TI An inter-sectoral comparison of green supply chain management in China:
   Drivers and practices
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The issue of green supply chain management (GSCM) has received increased attention in recent years among manufacturing practice and research. Yet, the corporate and environmental manufacturing issues in developing countries have not been as well investigated. This paper compares drivers and practices of GSCM in one developing country, China, focusing on three typical sectors, the automobile industry, the thermal power plants and the electronic/electrical industry. We sought to determine where the differences occur and which industries are further along. This study indicates that Chinese companies in different industries have differing drivers and practices. We tend to confirm that globalization and China's entry into the world trade organization have helped promote GSCM practices in manufacturing enterprises. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BUSINESS AND POLITICS
AB Apart from being one of the hardest hit sectors during the 2008 financial crisis, the auto sector is also a prominent sector where emerging auto markets such as China have fared relatively well compared to their competitors in North America and Europe. This paper examines various ways that nations have shifted their policy gears to revive and restructure the automotive industry by using the case studies of the USA, France, and China. New sets of policy initiatives are contingent on particular industrial and institutional contexts, but both developed and developing countries have employed wide range of "murky" protectionist measures. This makes it unlikely for the WTO member countries to take a naming and shaming approach and file a case at the WTO level, which poses challenges to the WTO rules and trade liberalization.

AB Sugar is one of the most policy distorted of all agricultural commodities, with high protection in the EU, Japan, and the United States which provides more than double the world market price to producers. High protection has slowed the growth of imports in these countries and deprived lower cost producers-mostly in developing countries-of export opportunities. Past efforts to reform policies have met with stiff opposition and little success. However, internal changes in the EU and U.S. and inter-national commitments made under the WTO, NAFTA and Everything But Arms Initiatives make change unavoidable and provide the best opportunity for policy reform in several decades. The European Commission has already proposed reforms which would reduce internal prices by one-third and the recent WTO ruling against the EU sugar regime could hasten the reform process. The U.S. and Japan are also likely to come under increasing pressure for reform in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations. The nature of reforms can have very different consequences for developing countries. The benefits of sugar policy reform are greatest under multilateral reform, and according to recent studies, the global welfare gains of removal of all trade protection are estimated to total as much as $4.7 billion per year.

AB Internationally governments, employers and universities themselves have questioned whether graduates have been adequately prepared to enter an internationalised workforce. Education is now Australia's third largest export industry, but there is little evidence about the utility of learning outcomes for international students from developing countries who study a business degree in Australia and return home after graduation.
   My research investigated the relationship between the outcomes a Group of Eight University (Go8 University) in Australia suggests its graduates possess, in the context of its internationalisation and graduate attributes policies, with the actual outcomes that have utility for international students from a developing country. This was explored through the experiences of a group of Vietnamese business graduates who studied in Australia and then returned to the world of work in Vietnam after graduation. Vietnam's adherence to Marxism and Leninism provided an opportunity to test the efficacy of the university's pedagogies and policies for graduates returning to a country where tension is caused by the duality of communist ideals and free market economics as it opens its doors to the western world following its admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2006.
   Using a snowball technique to recruit graduates to the study, data was collected from business graduates through the conduct of individual interviews in Vietnam and afterwards through the completion of a graduate attributes questionnaire. Focus group interviews were later conducted in Vietnam in the final phase of the data collection process. The learning outcomes that have utility to the business graduates involved in this study were then compared with the Go8 University's policies about internationalisation and the attributes it suggests its graduates possess. The research was informed by university policy and the literature relating to internationalisation of higher education, internationalisation of the curriculum and the development of graduate attributes.
   The attainment of a business degree was the sole focus of the business graduates when they left Vietnam. It helped them meet their employment and social ambitions when they returned to Vietnam. Whilst the disciplinary knowledge graduates learned in their degree has proved useful, graduates advise that not all knowledge can be applied in a developing country where culture and the duality of communist social principles and free market economics conflict. It is the development of an international perspective, graduate attributes and a world view that has actually prepared the graduates to meet the ongoing challenges in the workplace as Vietnam opens its doors to the western world.

AB Along with China's rise in world trade, there has been growing concern among developing countries including Turkey about competition with Chinese exports. This paper quantitatively investigates whether Chinese exports crowded out Turkish exports in world markets during the period 1990-2006 using extended gravity model. We include Chinese exports as an explanatory variable and investigate the impact of "China factor" in Turkish export performance in foreign markets. Using bilateral trade data, we also conduct our analyses for specific markets, specific product groups, and specific time periods. We found that for the large part, Chinese exports do not crowd out Turkish exports. This result holds for different markets as well as for different products. However for the period during which China was a member of the World Trade Organization, the results are inconclusive.

TI The Doha Development Agenda: What's on the table?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB The outlines of a potential agreement, emerging after seven years of negotiations, imply that Doha offers three key potential benefits: reduced uncertainty of market access in goods and services; improved market access in agriculture and manufacturing; and the mobilization of resources to deal with the trade problems of least developed countries. WTO Members have offered to make large reductions in legally bound levels of protection in goods and services. The reductions in currently applied levels of protection are smaller. For the least developed countries, the proposed 'duty free and quota free' access will only add significantly to their access under existing preferential access arrangements if industrial and developing country members include vital tariff lines. The initiatives on trade facilitation and aid for trade can play a valuable catalytic role in promoting reform and mobilizing assistance, but substantial effort is still needed to translate notional benefits into actual gain.

SO EKONOMISTA
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of potential impact of liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities (the Doha Round of WTO) on the economies of Poland and several other selected countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Brazil and the US). Three proposals on trade liberalization, submitted by European Communities, the US and G-20 (a group of developing countries) are presented and compared.
   The simulation of potential effects of custom duties reduction, provision of financial support as well as of the elimination of export subsidies, based on the computable general equilibrium model (GTAP), indicates that for the European countries changes in trade flows would relatively be insubstantial. Poland, from trade liberalization, might derive certain benefits in the production of live animals, dairy products and certain grains.

A typology of countries and appropriate policy rules of thumb are developed as a guide to both national policymakers and multilateral rule making in the WTO.

TI Mercantalist Concerns in US GSP Law: Termination of GSP Benefits to
   India
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB As has been the case with many developed countries, the United States unilaterally grants trade preferences to developing countries under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Programme. The US GSP Programme is granted on the basis of a few conditions, some of which are compulsory, while others are discretionary on part of the President of the US. In June 2018, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) conducted a review of India's eligibility as a Beneficiary Developing Country on the grounds that India does not provide the US 'equitable and reasonable access to its markets'. This is one of the discretionary conditions under the GSP Programme. On 31 May 2019, the US President, via Proclamation 9902, modified the list of Beneficiary Developing Countries withdrawing the GSP benefits that were granted to India, citing India's failure to fulfil the said market access condition. In light of this, the article analyses the legality of grant and withdrawal of GSP benefits on this market access condition with respect to the World Trade Organization (WTO) law. The article begins with exploring the historical development of the Generalized System of Preferences from the GATT-era to the present WTO regime. It then examines the validity of the US GSP Programme in light of the relevant WTO framework, in particular, the 1979 Enabling Clause. It also analyses the US GSP Programme in light of the WTO Appellate Body Report in the EC-Tariff Preferences case. The article concludes by suggesting the possible arguments that India could make in a potential dispute and the larger political ramifications of challenging the US GSP Programme.

TI Exchanging development for market access? Deep integration and
   industrial policy under multilateral and regional-bilateral trade
   agreements
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This paper analyzes the developmental trade-offs involved in multilateral versus regional-bilateral strategies of integration into the international economy. I contrast the regulations that guide policy in the areas of trade, investment, and intellectual property in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in regional-bilateral agreements between the US and developing countries. Both strategies of integration feature similar trade-offs, in that developing countries gain increased market access and opportunities for specialization in exchange for diminished space for use of industrial policy instruments to create new productive capacities. However, the trade-offs are intensified in the case of regional-bilateral agreements: countries receive more market access, but in exchange make significantly deeper concessions regarding the management of inward investment and intellectual policy. I argue that countries whose integration into the international economy is guided by their obligations as members of the WTO still have opportunities to implement industrial strategies that are designed to alter comparative advantages and achieve upward mobility in the international economic order, but the obligations under the regional-bilateral strategy greatly circumscribe these options. The paper thus points to the need for new terms of reference in the debate over 'policy space' in the international political economy. In analyzing contemporary development strategies, the most useful contrast is not between the alternatives that countries have under the WTO and the alternatives that countries had in the past under the WTO's predecessors, but between a constraining multilateral environment and even more constraining regional and bilateral environments that condition increased market access on the sacrifice of the very tools that countries have historically used to capture the developmental benefits of integration into the international economy.

AB Mutual recognition is a useful tool for international liberalization in particular contexts. However, it poses two important types of risk. First, it could jeopardize a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition should be limited to initiatives that can be supported by satisfactory essential harmonization that can protect a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. Second, mutual recognition could disadvantage poor states, either de jure through closed recognition among developed states or de facto through harmonization or equivalence conditions that are excessive, or excessively costly, for poor states. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition initiatives should be designed to be accessible to poor states.

TI A game theoretic model of drug launch in India
SO HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW
AB There is a popular belief that drug launch is delayed in developing countries like India because of delayed transfer of technology due to a 'post-launch' imitation threat through weak intellectual property rights (IPR). In fact, this belief has been a major reason for the imposition of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights regime under the WTO. This construct undermines the fact that in countries like India, with high reverse engineering capabilities, imitation can occur even before the formal technology transfer, and fails to recognize the first mover advantage in pharmaceutical markets. This paper argues that the first mover advantage is important and will vary across therapeutic areas, especially in developing countries with diverse levels of patient enlightenment and quality awareness. We construct a game theoretic model of incomplete information to examine the delay in drug launch in terms of costs and benefits of first move, assumed to be primarily a function of the therapeutic area of the new drug. Our model shows that drug launch will be delayed only for external (infective/communicable) diseases, while drugs for internal, non-communicable diseases (accounting for the overwhelming majority of new drug discovery) will be launched without delay.

TI Export Restrictions and the WTO Law: How to Reform the 'Regulatory
   Deficiency'
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Trade barriers in the form of export restrictions imposed on various food products and natural resources have been subject to extensive public attention. A notable illustration of the grousing importance of export restrictions was the establishment of a panel by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in December 2009 to examine complaints brought by the United States, the European Union (EU), and Mexico concerning China's export restriction policies. While export restrictions undermine the stability of the multilateral trading system by distorting global markets, the WTO law regulating this field arguably represents a case of 'under-regulation' or 'regulatory deficiency'. Hence, stricter WTO regulation in this area of apparently large 'policy space' is needed. However, various reform proposals submitted to the WTO face strong opposition mainly from developing countries. In this context, this article attempts to illustrate how a sufficiently 'differentiated' reform agenda on export restrictions could help maintain the stability of the multilateral trading system while addressing the legitimate concerns of developing countries.

TI Poverty impacts of the volume-based special safeguard mechanism
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB The volume-based Special Safeguard Mechanism (Q-SSM) was proposed as essential for small, poor farmers and became the proximate cause of the collapse of the Doha Agenda negotiations in 2008. But is it helpful for these farmers, given that it is likely to be applied when farm output is depressed and many poor farmers in developing countries need to buy food? Stochastic simulations for 31 countries suggest that use of this safeguard in line with the proposed WTO rules would raise the world poverty headcount by an average of 24million. The adverse poverty impact of the duty is larger when the quantity safeguard is triggered than it would be in other years, because lower farm output reduces the benefits to poor farm households from higher prices.

This will be a benchmark against which to examine various multilateral and preferential trade policy scenarios that might emerge over the next decade as part of the WTO's Doha Round and from the expected move later this decade towards Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union. The results suggest modest gains or worse for Uganda, in part because it already has low tariffs. and ready preferential access to rich-country markets. Several important caveats to this type of analysis are stressed though, before drawing out some trade and policy implications for Uganda.

TI Institutional and normative considerations for copyright and access to
   education in developing countries: rethinking incremental solutions
   through limitations and exceptions
SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB This article considers both national and multilateral approaches to facilitate access to copyrighted materials for educational purposes in developing countries. It emphasizes the need for both normative re-ordering and institutional reform. In case of normative re-ordering, the article highlights the role that national institutions like courts, in addition to legislators, might play in crafting case-by-case educational exceptions. However, it argues that limitations and exceptions in themselves are insufficient doctrinal mechanisms on which to place the sole burden of facilitating effective access to educational materials. At the international level, the article proposes an approach that goes beyond the current emphasis on limitations and exceptions. Such an approach should evolve within the international intellectual property (IP) system and its affiliated institutions like WIPO and the WTO. The failure of attempts to provide normative solutions for access to other public goods such as public health or climate-related technologies, strongly suggests that institutional reform and normative re-ordering must be simultaneously pursued in the international arena. The article suggests that in the area of copyright and access to education, WIPO is the best institution to lead in devising multilateral solutions. However, it should minimize its emphasis on treaty making and instead place more emphasis on quasi-legal and non-legal mechanisms. The article evaluates recent institutional and normative reforms in WIPO, including the Development Agenda and the activities of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights, as a structural basis for creating a platform for a new approach to access to public goods governed by the international copyright system.

AB Differential pricing of essential drugs is an intuitively obvious component of any comprehensive response to the AIDS crisis. Constructing an effective regime of price discrimination between first and third world pharmaceutical markets, however, raises complicated economic, legal and political challenges. Low-priced drugs in developing countries could trigger forms of physical and informational arbitrage that could undermine prices and profits in lucrative first world markets. Furthermore, the pricing of AIDS drugs highlights legal tensions between public health concerns and private intellectual property rights under the WTO TRIPS agreement. This essay explores these issues and examines how classic economic models of price discrimination can afford a political framework to mediate first- and third-world tensions over essential drugs, providing a template that can maintain the integrity of intellectual property rights while respecting humanitarian concerns over access to life-saving drugs.

AB Training programmes form an important means of capacity building for developing countries. While there are several training programmes being run across the world, both by international organizations as well as by countries themselves, there is limited scholarship and publicly available information on the inner workings of training programmer, their effectiveness, challenges faced by the stakeholders, and other related issues. This Note is a modest attempt to bridge this gap. The notes forming the basis of this Note are derived from my experiences gained from organizing, participating and facilitating such training programmes, while working in the research and policy sector. Some of the discussions in this Note also concern the practical aspects of training programmes. Towards the end of the Note, 1 offer some constructive suggestions towards enhancing the effectiveness of training programmes.

TI Antitrust and Compulsory Licensing in BRICS and Developing Countries
SO COMPETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE BRICS AND IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:
   LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS
SE International Law and Economics
AB Compulsory licensing is a powerful tool for broadening access to inventions protected by intellectual property rights without the rights owner consent, and is highly disciplined by International Law and individual countries legislation. Although compatible with the WTO rules, compulsory licensing has rarely been used despite being an available competition policy instrument (i.e. antitrust remedy) in most jurisdictions. It can in particular be a powerful policy tool-as concerns pharmaceuticals-to address the well-known health burden held by the population in the poorer nations.
   While compulsory licensing unambiguously improves access to (existent) health treatments and to protected technologies in general, its impact on profits and innovation rates is a more controversial issue. The economic literature has minimized the arguments against the use of the instrument, but competition policy has been too shy in using such a powerful tool, in particular in BRICS and other developing countries.
   This chapter overviews the lag between the possible and the actual use of compulsory licensing as an antitrust sanction and of mandatory licensing as a condition for merger approval, in particular in the BRICS and other developing countries.

TI RAISING THE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD -
   THE RELENTLESS PUSH FOR DATA EXCLUSIVITY
SO DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS
AB Since the adoption of the WTO-TRIPS Agreement in 1994, there has been significant controversy over the impact of pharmaceutical patent protection on the access to medicines in the developing world. In addition to the market exclusivity provided by patents, the pharmaceutical industry has also sought to further extend their monopolies by advocating the need for additional 'regulatory' protection for new medicines, known as data exclusivity.
   Data exclusivity limits the use of clinical trial data that need to be submitted to the regulatory authorities before a new drug can enter the market. For a specified period, generic competitors cannot apply for regulatory approval for equivalent drugs relying on the originator's data. As a consequence, data exclusivity lengthens the monopoly for the original drug, impairing the availability of generic drugs.
   This article illustrates how the pharmaceutical industry has convinced the US and the EU to impose data exclusivity on their trade partners, many of them developing countries. The key arguments formulated by the pharmaceutical industry in favor of adopting data exclusivity and their underlying ethical assumptions are described in this article, analyzed, and found to be unconvincing. Contrary to industry's arguments, it is unlikely that data exclusivity will promote innovation, especially in developing countries. Moreover, the industry's appeal to a property rights claim over clinical test data and the idea that data exclusivity can prevent the generic competitors from 'free-riding' encounters some important problems: Neither legitimize excluding all others.

TI Climate change and trade policy: from legal complications to time factor
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the legal complications prevail towards the architecture of mutual policy design between trade and climate change regimes. The recent literature on this topic is mainly focused on commons and has significantly ignored the existing regulatory constraints between both the regimes. Therefore, in this study relevant WTO and environmental laws are critically examined in order to bring another side of literally work on trade-climate policy framework. Moreover, the time factor, role of developing countries and two approaches are also discussed that are important constituents to be considered during ongoing climate change multilateral talks.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper has six parts in total. Part one comprises of "Introduction", part two gives "Overview of relevant WTO and climate change regulations", part three describes "Antithesis of WTO and climate change rules" and explains the differences that both regimes posses in the basics of their nature, part four enumerates that how to galvanize the anticipated disputes among both the regimes, part five is focused on the participation of developing countries and their possible reservations towards climate policy and, part six gives some concluding remarks.
   Findings - This study found four major points of caution while architecting climate change policy. First, the climate change policy gives excuse to certain economies to protect their domestic industry, which is supposedly the violation of WTO rules. Second, the disputes arise at WTO platform from the climate friendly trade policies would be a new inconvincible challenge. Third, the GATT article XX (general exceptions) and agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures (ASCM) are still not clearly defined under climate change regime. Fourth, the position of least developed countries (LDCs), there is no action plan as these countries are the most affected due to possible stringent trade-climate policies.
   Research limitations/implications - This research posses potential policy implication for both governments and international organizations, and provides new direction to trade and climate change researchers. It opens the way to critically examine the legal issues addressed in this paper which subsequently help both trade climate change regimes to overcome such regulatory differences with mutual consensus.
   Practical implications - As policy implication this study suggests that what has been achieved during last two decades over climate change issue, and how long would it take to achieve the reasonable targets? In-fact, the past work has succeeded to address the climate change as the global issue and it needs to be solved jointly but there is still a long way to make potential progress in order to architect the comprehensive policy and designing of multilateral agreements. It needs more time to constitute a climate change regime free from individual countries' political and economical interests and consensus amongst all major countries and group.
   Originality/value - Most the current literature only focuses common options between trade and climate change policy regimes and significantly ignores the potential legal constraints. In this regards, this study fills existing gap in trade and climate change policy constraints and gives another new direction for policy makers.

SO FOOD CONTROL
AB This paper aims at assessing the implementation of the clauses of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement in a developing country context, namely Mauritius. It describes the regulatory and institutional infrastructure developed to meet new obligations under the SPS Agreement using an inventory approach and in-depth interviews at stakeholder level. The findings indicate that, as a developing Country, Mauritius has achieved a reasonable degree of compliance with its commitments towards the VVTO. A national accreditation body has been set up. A number of transparency mechanisms have been put in place such as a National Notification Authority, a Sanitary and Phytosanitary Enquiry Point and a national SPS committee involving the public and private sectors for communicating and discussing about SPS measures of trade relevance. Mauritius participated, to different extents, in the WTO SPS committee and in the activities of international standard-setting organisations. It has also updated some SPS-related laws. There have been operational changes in local organisations dealing with SPS issues. However, constraints such as the insufficient capacity to do risk assessment and to carry out equivalence might prevent Mauritius from meeting all its obligations towards the WTO.

The principal challenges include the systemic reforms of the organization, enhanced market access, elimination of supply constraints, and the use of special and differentiated treatment and regional integration as intermediary step to multilateralism. The paper concludes that the WTO framework can facilitate trade and development on the continent. There are, however, some prerequisites which are considered in five areas: (1) the strengthening of the national institutions co-ordinating the WTO activities, (2) a capacity building programme for capitals and Geneva-based personnel, (3) transparency in WTO and account for developing countries' capacity in various aspects of the accords, (4) enhanced market access and alleviation of constraints to production and trade, (5) policy coherence with other institutions, particularly those of Bretton Woods.

TI Multilateral Trade Liberalization and Terms of Trade Volatility
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB The world has experienced in recent years a rising anti-trade and anti-globalization sentiment, which would likely jeopardize recent efforts by the international trade community, in particular Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), to promote multilateral trade liberalization (MTP). The current article investigates the impact of MTP on countries' terms of trade volatility. Results based on a large panel dataset suggest that MTP exerts a significant reducing effect on countries' terms of trade volatility. However, this impact appears to be dependent on countries' development level. The take-home message is that greater cooperation on trade matters, including among WTO Members would help promote multilateral trade liberalization, which would surely contribute to reducing terms of trade volatility, for the benefits of all countries, in particular developing economies.

TI Restricting Biofuel Imports in the Name of the Environment: How Does the
   Application of WTO Rules Affect Developing Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB There are calls for biofuel imports from developing countries to be restricted. The imports which are either in the form of end-product (bioethanol or biodiesel) or feedstock (oil palm, sugar cane molasses, etc) are allegedly produced in ways which can threaten the environment and violate human rights. This article finds that there is no specific regime for trade in biofuels within the WTO system. Hence any restriction on such trade is governed by the existing trade regimes including tariffs and non-tariff measures. However, the existing WTO tariff and non-tariff (TBT, anti-dumping and anti-subsidy) regimes are still inadequate in ensuring that measures are taken against biofuel feedstock and products that were produced in unsustainable ways. The use of these measures without being subject to clear defining rules will create a danger that they serve a protectionist rather than social or environmental objectives.

I use a standard "gravity" model of bilateral merchandise trade and a large panel data set covering over 50 years and 175 countries. An extensive search reveals little evidence that countries joining or belonging to the GATT/WTO have different trade patterns from outsiders, though the GSP seems to have a strong effect.

AB Concerns about natural resource use and the environment on one side and about the trade effects of environmental policies on the other are becoming increasingly prominent in trade and trade policy discussions, including those involving the recently formed World Trade Organization. Many developing countries perceive the entwining of environmental and trade issues as a threat to their sovereignty and their economies, while influential groups in industrial countries consider it unfair, ecologically unsound, and even immoral to trade with and invest in countries adopting much lower environmental standards than theirs. This article examines why these issues are becoming more prominent, whether the World Trade Organization is art appropriate forum in which to discuss them, how they affect developing countries, and what those countries should do about it. It concludes that the direct effect on developing economies is likely to be small and may even be positive for some through improved terms of trade or compensatory transfer payments. But great care is needed to avoid inappropriate uses of trade measures to pursue environmental objectives. Otherwise there is considerable risk of an adverse indirect effect on developing and other economies through the erosion of the rules-based multilateral trading system.

TI Liberalization Agreements in the GATT/WTO and the Terms-of-trade
   Externality Theory: Evidence from Three Developing Countries
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB The terms-of-trade theory suggests that governments engage in trade negotiations with their trade partners in an effort to escape from a terms-of-trade prisoner's dilemma by mutually internalizing externalities that they impose on each other. In this paper, I use predictions of the terms-of-trade relationship to provide support for the theory based on the negotiating patterns of three developing countries during the Uruguay Round of the Generalized Agreements on Tariff and Trade. I use industry level import value as well as tariff schedules from these contracting party states that were graduated from the US Generalized System of Preferences list during the Uruguay Round. I exploit the rapid change in their tariff schedules from the best response to the optimal level within a single negotiation round to empirically test the terms-of-trade theory. I find that my estimates are consistent with the predictions of the theory as applied to these three developing countries that were compelled to negotiate for tariff concessions during the Uruguay Round.

In the political economy equilibrium, we find that the tariff schedule will be V-shaped: it decreases initially to maintain the viability of the industry but increases thereafter as the industry expands and gains political power. We use the model to explain both China's tariff offers in WTO negotiations and GATT/WTO rules regarding developing countries.

China's proposals in the DDA rules negotiations raise a wide variety of issues related to clarifying and improving WTO rules, primarily from an exporting country's perspective. In order to play a leading role in.advocating a development agenda, China has tabled a series of constructive, specific proposals that would provide S&D treatments for developing countries. China faces several challenges in the rules negotiations: how to co-operate with the exporting countries group, whose goal is to clarify and improve current anti-dumping rules; how to continue to represent the interests Of developing and least-developed countries; and at the same time, how to achieve its agenda while satisfying the concerns of recalcitrant major developed countries that want to preserve the basic concepts, principles, and effectiveness of the existing rules.

TI The WTO enabling clause and positive conditionality in the European
   Community's GSP program
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Like virtually all developed countries, the European Community grants special trade preferences to developing countries by way of a generalized scheme of preferences, known as a GSP program. In addition, the EC operates a rewards-based system of 'special incentive arrangements', according to which developing countries may apply for further preferences if they can demonstrate compliance with specified environmental and labour standards. This article assesses this system of positive conditionality in light of WTO rules. It begins with an outline of the EC's GSP program and a discussion of the relevant governing instruments, in particular the 1971 GSP Decision and the 1979 Enabling Clause. It then discusses certain systemic issues, such as the implications of the fact that GSP preferences are granted on a voluntary basis, and the present legal status of the Enabling Clause. The article next addresses the substantive question whether the description of trade preferences as 'generalized, non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory' in the GSP Decision represents a condition of their legality under the Enabling Clause. The final section of this article analyses the meaning of these terms, with special reference to their drafting history, and presents a view on the legality of the EC's system of positive conditionality.

TI Fair trade for all: How trade can promote development
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB In Fair Trade for All: How Trade Can Promote Development, Stiglitz and Charlton prescribe what a multilateral trade agreement-that promotes development and is fair for all-would include. This review appraises their prescriptions and offers some alternatives. Many of their ideas about what developed countries should do (opening markets, especially of labor intensive goods and services and cutting farm subsidies) are quite familiar and sensible. More controversially, however they propose that all WTO members (both developed and developing) completely open their markets to all developing countries poorer and smaller than themselves. They also stress the importance of preserving domestic policy space, dropping intellectual property rules from the WTO and keeping restrictive rules off the agenda. Among its criticisms 0 the book, the review points out that the liberalization proposal contradicts their own arguments favoring individually tailored policies in developing countries and is likely to maximize trade diversion. In addition, their prescriptions for more policy space neglects the more desirable, possibility of a WTO in which members accept differentiated commitments.

AB Food retail transformation in developing countries continues to receive attention due to its implications for business expansion and food system development. We assess the dynamism of supermarketization in two relatively understudied regions-Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa-applying the institution-based view and econometric analysis of a pooled cross-sectional dataset of over 700 country-year observations. While modern food retail has shown rapid growth, the traditional food retail segment is still dominant in both regions. The observed food retail patterns may be attributed to economic factors (income levels), sociodemographic (female labor force participation, urbanization, and religion), and institutional factors (control of corruption, ease of starting a business, time to enforce a contract, and World Trade Organization membership). However, while economic and sociodemographic variables exhibit similar effects in both regions, results are mixed regarding the institutional factors; potential explanations are suggested [EconLit citations: O100, L100].

TI Tariff-jumping antidumping duties
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines the tariff-jumping response of all firm and product combinations subject to US antidumping investigations from 1980 to 1990 using a newly constructed database. Previous studies have focused only on Japanese FDI responses to antidumping protection and found large tariff-jumping responses. In contrast, this paper finds quite modest tariff-jumping responses and the evidence suggests that tariff-jumping is only a realistic option for multinational firms from industrialized countries. This may partially explain developing countries' concerns about addressing AD protection in the WTO. Despite high tariff-jumping responses, there is no evidence of a Japanese-specific propensity to tariff-jump, holding other economic factors constant. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Taxation of exports - theory and practice
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
AB Taxation of export has been used by many countries. As of June 2014, there are 53 member countries of the WTO using export tariffs or taxes. Theoretically, a large country which is able to influence the world price of the given commodity could be better off by the export tax levied on it. Practically, there are many problems with implementing this tool of trade policy. Empirical case studies have shown that usually the objectives of this policy were not accomplished. The key problem connected with the export taxation of primary agricultural products is that it can even harm the poor because of the significant share of these products in their consumption. From the point of the world economy as a whole, this policy leads to distortions and efficiency losses. Therefore, it can never be the first-best policy.

TI WTO and Developing Nations: Disparities in the WTO Dispute Settlement
   Mechanism
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
AB The Uruguay Round of Agreement promised the new changes to previous dispute settlement system formed under GATT 1947. The imposition of sanction as it was under previous GATT was promised to be inoperative and was no longer to be vetoed unilaterally as per the WTO. The impartiality towards all member countries were also promised by WTO 1995 based on more legalistic approach to protect the bargaining power of member countries which was based on Market size of each individual member country thus developed countries as well as developing countries and LDC's were to be beneficiary's.
   The dispute settlement understanding was deemed to be in favour of developing countries, but the WTO documents reveal that it was actually the United States with the support of some developing countries who got the GATT's veto rule eliminated.(1) Initially few developing countries supported the new DSU but most of them were against the new DSU system as they were asking for special and differential treatment.(2)
   As Developing Nations and least-developed nations are frequently the subject of unjust behavior by rich countries, the majority of least-developed countries, even as third parties, are unwilling to approach the DSM. (Members of the WTO that participate in the lawsuit as a third party are those impacted by the infringement, but not directly involved, that a nation submits as a complaint to the DSM. Third parties engage in a legal procedure by joining the complainant in the role of a 'next friend' in order to support the plaintiffs case.) The little usage of the DSM by the poorer developing nations is regrettable since this method may frequently achieve more progress than the negotiating consensus approach.

TI Access to Medicines and Medical Equipment during COVID-19: Searching
   Compatibility between the WTO and the WHO
SO INDIA QUARTERLY-A JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Affordable access to medicines is a key determinant of a country's resilience to health crises. The modern hyper-connected international trade and production networks have a vital role to play in ensuring this accessibility, especially in the context of a pandemic.This article focuses on the medicines and medical equipment and analyses the synergistic role of the two international organisations-The World Trade Organisation (WTO) and The World Health Organisation (WHO), in assuring affordable access to these goods globally. WHO is responsible for global healthcare regulations; however, the medical supply chain originates in a few developed countries, manufactured in bulk (in case of medicine) at low cost in developing countries, and finally traded worldwide. Here, the role of WTO comes-it facilitates global trade cooperation and intellectual property rights monitoring, both key elements in medical goods production and trading. Despite the need for cooperation in mitigating COVID-19, much of the global response to COVID-19 has been fragmented and inward-looking. This lack of coordination has serious repercussions especially for developing countries. We use qualitative content analysis methodology, connecting concepts of cooperation theory and global governance, to identify the joint role of the two organisations in fostering global cooperation in medical goods accessibility.

TI The WTO-TRIPS Flexibilities on Public Health: A Critical Appraisal of
   the East African Community Regional Framework
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB Over the years, many developing countries have attempted to make policies utilizing the WTO-TRIPS flexibilities to address the public health needs of their populations. A common strategic trend in these policies has been the tendency to attempt to increase access to medicines through price reduction, achieved by weakening patent protection. This paper, using the policy that has recently been adopted by the East African Community (EAC) member states as a case study, demonstrates the inappropriateness of this strategy. The core argument is that weakening patent protection will hinder further research and invention, which are necessary to ensure the availability of medicines. For developing countries, especially those in Africa, such as the EAC member states, the problem is aggravated by the fact that pharmaceuticals, due to commercial considerations, have already ignored investing in developing medicines for diseases predominant in these countries, hence the need to strengthen rather than weaken, patent protection.

TI Migration governance through trade agreements: insights from the MITA
   dataset
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB States struggle to establish multilateral cooperation on migration - yet they include more and more migration provisions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs). This article sheds light on this phenomenon by introducing the Migration Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements (MITA) dataset. Covering 797 agreements signed between 1960 and 2020, this dataset offers a fine-grained coding of three types of migration provisions: those that facilitate the international mobility of service providers and labor migrants, protect migrant rights, and control unauthorized migration. Against the backdrop of limping multilateralism, we examine PTAs' migration policy content with regard to two key cooperation dilemmas: conflicts of interest within developed countries and between them and developing countries. Facilitating business and labor mobility might be a possible way around the first dilemma, commonly referred to as the 'liberal paradox': the tension between economic demands for openness and political calls for closure. Nevertheless, this facilitation is largely limited to highly skilled migrants and agreements between developed economies. Provisions for migration control tend to be included in agreements between developed and developing countries, which signals that states use issue-linkages to address the second dilemma, i.e. interest asymmetries. Finally, provisions for migrant rights stand out because they do not deepen over time. Our findings suggest that while PTAs have become an increasingly common venue for migration governance, the issue-linkage between trade and migration cooperation perpetuates entrenched divisions in the international system. The MITA dataset will allow researchers and policymakers to track the evolution of the trade-migration nexus and systematically investigate the motives for and effects of various migration provisions in PTAs.

TI GLOBALIZATION AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE WORLD ECONOMY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB Key aspects of the world economy transformation in the context of globalization are studied in the article. Various kinds of the structural changes are analyzed. The article focuses on estimates of key macroeconomic indicators published by the United Nations, World Bank, UNCTAD, UNIDO, WTO and other international organizations for analyzing historical growth of the world's largest economies and countries groups. Apart of statistics and calculations presented here draw from studies by government agencies and research centers. It presents a quantitative analysis of the structural relationship between developed and developing countries. Also the article discusses points of view on the potential factors for continued structural changes in the future. Specific attention is paid to the growing influence and strengthening positions of the emerging industrial economies (EIE) within the world economy. The particular role of manufacturing in the formation of the modern world geo-economic space is considered in detail. As shows in the article share of Asia and Asia-Pacjfic Region in global manufacturing grew from 30.4 to 49.5 per cent between 1991 and 2016 at the expense of Europe and North America, whose shares fell respectively from 37.1 to 25.1 and from 21.9 to 17.4 per cent. There is specially emphasized that China is the world's largest economy in terms of GDP on purchasing power parity, size of manufacturing and merchandise trade. But the author's conclusion is that, despite the world's second place after China in quantitative indexes USA ranks first in the world in terms of quality indicators of economic and social development. The dynamism and creativity have made the USA the most innovative nation in the world.

This paper discusses the extent to which these interests have been addressed in the July 2004 Framework Agreement and in the subsequent negotiations. Many of the key demands of developing countries appear to have been accepted in principle in the Agreement, but the lack of specific details on how most of these principles will be operationalised makes it hard to evaluate their real significance. Progress is needed on the development dimension of the negotiations if the Hong Kong Ministerial Council meeting is to succeed.

TI Review of Article 27.3(b) and the Patenting of Life Forms: Hitting a

SO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Under Article 27.3(b) of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO), all members are required to extend private property rights to life forms. Using official WTO documents, this article analyzes the negotiating positions of WTO members on life patents during a review of Article 27.3(b) which commenced in 1999 and is currently ongoing. Initially, developing countries raised serious ethical concerns regarding life patents, creating a clear North-South divide. However, over time the position of Brazil and India moved away from the ethics of life patents to the prevention of bio-piracy, a position supported by China. Russia too is supportive of life patents. A group of small developing countries have, however, continued to question the morality of life patents despite this "BRIC wall," changing the dynamics of the negotiations from a North-South divide to one which now includes a South-South divide.

TI THE IMPLICATIONS OF TRIPS TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR AND ACCESS TO
   MEDICINE: MALAYSIAN EXPERIENCE
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB IPRs have never been economically and politically more important or controversial than they are today. There are continuing debates over the pricing of essential drugs for ill and afflicted and their availability. In these debates the pharmaceutical sector has assumed unusual prominence particularly in regard to its relationship to IPRs, R&D incentives, pricing and access to medicines. Patents are particularly considered the most controversial and problematic area under TRIPS. Malaysia presents an interesting case because patents have been. granted to pharmaceutical products and processes since the introduction of the law in the 19(th) century. For many developing countries, patents were not granted for pharmaceutical products mainly to ensure the accessibility of essential drugs to the large majority of the population. This was because product patents have a direct impact on prices of drugs. The introduction of product patents in the TRIPS Agreement therefore became one of the most controversial issues in the WTO. As a result of these debates, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement on Public Health was announced in 2001. The Doha Declaration stated explicitly that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health. In particular, paragraph five of the declaration is more explicit and states that the member countries shall have the freedom with respect to compulsory licensing and to determine what constitute national emergency and other circumstances of extreme urgency. However, many developing countries have expressed their apprehension in using these flexibilities effectively in addressing their internal public health concerns. There is lack of clarity in the application of these flexibilities and this can be provided if some principles and guidelines which are pro-public health and pro-access are formulated.

AB This article is about the World Trade Organization's Doha Round negotiation on industrial tariffs - i.e., WTO law making process. We make a number of observations on the most recent negotiating text, the December 2008 modalities, based on simulations of its implementation for different types of WTO members. The imports of developed countries and advanced developing countries, which represent one third of the WTO membership but 95% of world trade, are liberalized to a small degree. The other two thirds of the WTO membership are covered under a complex web of special categories and exceptions that calls into question their future participation in the international trading system. Moreover, the tariff reductions are to be achieved in a highly differentiated manner across WTO members. All the different cases and carve outs in the text are like cushions that members use to avoid undertaking a more significant trade liberalization, but in doing so they also defeat the Doha mandate in terms of the degree of ambition required.

TI Audience Features and the Strategic Timing of Trade Disputes
SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB If international institutions are such potent alarm mechanisms that mobilize procompliance domestic audiences, as many existing theories argue, why do countries wait so long before sounding the alarm? World Trade Organization (WTO) members often wait months or even years before objecting to their trading partners' WTO-illegal barriers. To turn a phrase, trade cooperation delayed is trade cooperation denied, so why wait? To explain this variation, I develop a theory of institutional alarm mechanisms in which (1) the preferences and strength of the audience hearing the alarm vary and (2) the decision to sound the alarm is strategic. Sounding the alarm is most valuable when strong audiences in the defendant country support compliance. I test this prediction using competing risks models analyzing the timing of WTO disputes against US tariff barriers. Consistent with the theory, disputes are more likely during election years when macroeconomic indicators suggest broader support for free trade.

AB Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) proceed simultaneously, not sequentially, and all Members must accept all the results. I show that the so-called Single Undertaking is both a negotiation technique and a constitutive metaphor. It does not cause an outcome to negotiations, whether in a round or the daily life of the WTO, but it shapes the possibility of an outcome. The methodological innovation of the article is the use of counterfactual analysis to assess whether the Single Undertaking can be relaxed using concepts suggested by the various critiques. I consider rounds of negotiations, the consensus principle, diffuse reciprocity, critical mass decision making, the WTO acquis and special and differential treatment for developing countries. One aspect of integrative bargaining strategies, issue linkage, is also considered. The Single Undertaking emerged in the interaction structured by the regime, and the same process could lead to it being eliminated, but that is unlikely.

TI Impacts of tangible and intangible elements of Aid for Trade on the
   globalisation of developing countries
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB The Aid for Trade initiative was launched by the WTO in 2005 to help developing countries build their supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructure to improve their capacity in the global market. This study investigates the impacts of both the tangible and intangible elements of this initiative on the economic, social and political globalisation of recipient countries. Intangible elements of Aid for Trade (aid for trade policy and regulation) may be considered as the software of Aid for Trade, while tangible elements (aid for economic infrastructure and building productive capacity) are the hardware. Countries that receive Aid for Trade can use both types of elements to succeed in globalisation. This research hypothesises that the tangible elements of Aid for Trade have a singular effect on the overall level of globalisation since they are expected to only increase the level of economic globalisation. Moreover, we expect that the intangible elements of Aid for Trade will have multiple effects on the overall level of globalisation as they have an impact on not only economic aspects but also social and political aspects of it. Using the dataset of Aid for Trade from 2002 to 2015, we find that the intangible elements of Aid for Trade have increased the recipients' level of overall globalisation.

TI Dual WTO Notifications of RTAS with Non-Reciprocal Trade Liberalization
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Disagreement between the parties involved in regional trade agreements (RTAs) about the legal basis of RTAs has led to dual notifications of some RTAs to the WTO. Dually notified RTAs are characterized by non-reciprocal trade liberalization between developing and developed RTA parties. If all the parties of a dually notified RTA are 'developing' countries, the RTA can find its legal basis both under Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause. In that case, the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) and the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) may both serve as forums for reviewing dually notified RTAs under the Transparency Mechanism for Regional Trade Agreements. However, if one of the parties of a dually notified RTA is a 'developed' country, the RTA's legal basis is solely in Article XXIV. To determine the development status of the parties to a dually notified RTA, the WTO should require the RTA party notifying under Article XXIV to disclose its economic development status for the purpose of the WTO review based on the 'self-selection' principle. If the party notifying under Article XXIV declares itself a 'developed' country, the CRTA would be the sole forum for the review. However, if the party declares itself a 'developing' country, both the CRTA and the CTD may serve as appropriate forums for the review. A proposal made during the Doha Round to require all RTA parties to make a joint notification under a single legal basis is inconsistent with the WTO law and would not serve the purpose of effective review of RTAs under the WTO.

TI Cautionary Notes on a Global Tiered Pricing Framework for Medicines
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Recently, there has been a policy momentum toward creating a global tiered pricing framework, which would provide differentiated prices for medicines globally, based on each country's capacity to pay.
   We studied the most influential proposals for a tiered pricing framework since the 1995 World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. We synthesized 6 critical questions to be addressed for a global framework to function and explored the many challenges of implementation.
   Although we acknowledge that there is the potential for an exceptional global commitment that would benefit both producers and those in developing countries in need of wider access to medicines, our greatest concern is to ensure that a global framework does not price out the poor from pharmaceutical markets nor threaten current flexibilities within the international patent regime.

TI Preferential Trade Agreements
SO HANDBOOK OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, VOL 1B
SE Handbooks in Economics
AB A large and growing number of countries participate in multiple preferential trade agreements (PTAs), which increasingly entail broad cooperation over policies extending far beyond trade barriers. I review the traditional and nontraditional motives for PTAs and their empirical determinants as well as their impacts on trade and on multilateral liberalization. I argue that the broad nature of modern PTAs, their substantial creation of bilateral trade, and their modest effects on members' tariffs, require us to augment the economic and policy structure of traditional models of PTAs as a static preferential tariff reduction. Throughout I draw lessons from the existing literature and point toward many interesting paths for future research, to advance our understanding of the causes of modern PTAs and their impacts on trade-related outcomes and beyond.

TI Compulsory Licenses for Access to Medicines, Expropriation and
   Investor-State Arbitration Under Bilateral Investment Agreements - Are
   There Issues Beyond the TRIPS Agreement?
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB In this paper, the author argues that compulsory licenses might potentially amount to indirect expropriation provided that their effects constitute a severe curtailment of the patent rights. Inasmuch as the expropriation standards in Bilateral Investment Agreements differ from those articulated under the TRIPS Agreement, particularly in the focus of due process and compensation requirements, the ability of developing countries to make use of compulsory licenses at the WTO level might be reduced. Also, regarding the arbitral procedure, it is of much value from the public health perspective that an investor-state arbitration structure could pursue a balanced reform between private investment and public policy. It is a matter for deliberation whether an ultimate return to state-state dispute settlement, rather than investor-state arbitration, would be more feasible to settle disputes concerning health-related compulsory licenses under BIAs.

TI Aid for trade and export diversification in recipient-countries
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB The Aid-for-Trade (AfT) Initiative was launched by the Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) with a view to helping developing countries and the least-developed countries (LDCs) expand their trade. The current paper contributes to the literature on AfT effectiveness by examining how AfT affects recipient-countries' export product diversification. The analysis has been carried out on a sample of 104 AfT recipient-countries over the period 2002-2015 and uses the two-step system generalised methods of moments (GMM) approach. Results show that AfT flows are conducive to export product diversification in recipient-countries. In addition, the analysis has shown a positive impact of the cumulative AfT flows on the export product diversification path of these countries. These results apply as well to the subsamples of LDCs and other developing countries. One policy implication of these results is that a scale-up of AfT would help recipient-countries to diversify their export products baskets and hence facilitate their greater integration into the global trading system.

   safety authorities: issues affecting developed and developing countries
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB During the negotiation of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement), there was clear recognition of the problems that developing countries would face in complying with the SPS Agreement. The agreement included provisions related to technical assistance and special differential treatment for developing countries. Both topics are discussed in the SIPS Committee as a regular agenda item and have been subject to substantive consideration during both reviews of the SIPS Agreement, in 1999 and latterly in 2005. The SIPS Committee is currently considering proposals to make these provisions more precise, effective and operational.
   The Standards and Trade Development Facility, (STDF) was formally established in mid-2002 by the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Organisation for Animal Health (DIE), World Bank, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization as a financing and coordinating mechanism. The STDF maintains a database which provides information on SPS-related technical assistance and capacity-building projects. From the limited data gathered, it would appear that the focus of the technical assistance provided so far has been knowledge transfer. Only a small minority of the projects reported deal with the strengthening of hard infrastructure such as laboratory facilities. It is also clear that in terms of the overall number and value of projects, animal health lags well behind the food safety sector. The World Bank estimates that annual expenditure by donor agencies on trade-related SIPS programmes has been running at some US$ 65 million to US$ 70 million annually. However, there is under-reporting of technical cooperation activities in the STDF database.

TI Tariffs and non-tariff frictions in the world wine trade
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB This article empirically investigates the impact of trade barriers on the world wine trade focusing on trade costs impeding exports, including transport, tariffs, technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards. A gravity model is estimated using data from the main importing and exporting countries for the years 1997-2010. The Poison pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator accounts for heteroskedasticity and the presence of zero trade flows. Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While SPS measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade. A decreasing trend for tariffs has largely been compensated by more stringent technical barriers. The overall result is that frictions in the world wine trade have not changed during the past 15 years.

TI Trading in Good Faith? Importing States' Economic Human Rights
   Obligations into the WTO's Doha Round
SO HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW
AB How trade rules affect human rights is a question mostly avoided in the World Trade Organization's Doha Round of negotiations to expand global trade liberalization. While the desire to keep trade talks focused on trade matters is legitimate, trade law has the potential to affect the realization of human rights, particularly economic rights. Through identifying and explaining the economic rights and corresponding state obligations in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), this article demonstrates the ways in which the ICESCR places tangible constraints on states parties when engaged in international trade law-making. The issues are examined through the example of agricultural tariff reductions for developing countries, as proposed in the Doha Round, and their likely impacts on the right to work of small and resource-poor farmers. The article focuses particularly on indirectly discriminatory dimensions of those impacts. It is concluded that many developing countries that are parties to the ICESCR will be in violation of their right to work and nondiscrimination obligations if they introduce the agricultural tariff reductions proposed in the Doha Round without taking correcting steps.

TI New Evidence on WTO Membership After the Uruguay Round: An Analysis at
   the Sectoral Level
SO OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW
AB The creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 brought several changes to the world trade system, including more stringent accession commitments, separate agreements for agricultural products and for textiles and garment. This study examines the effects of WTO membership on disaggregated sectoral trade flows and their extensive and intensive margins by means of a gravity model estimated by Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood. We employ a panel dataset on bilateral imports for agriculture, textile, and manufacturing sectors for the 1995-2017 period. Our estimates suggest that WTO membership has succeeded in expanding trade flows for new members. Nevertheless, this growth occurred asymmetrically between developed and developing countries, and among the different types of products. In the period under review, developing countries benefited most from this WTO-promoted increase in world trade, in stark contrast to the findings of the extant literature for 1950-2000. The largest trade growth occurred in the agriculture sector, which is also at odds with earlier findings of growth in manufacturing products only. Furthermore, our results show that the increase in trade due to WTO liberalization took place exclusively in the extensive margin of trade, most of which also happened in the agricultural sector.

TI "AIDS is not a business": A study in global corporate responsibility -
   Securing access to low-cost HIV medications
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB At the end of the 1990s, Brazil was faced with a potentially explosive HIV/AIDS epidemic. Through an innovative and multifaceted campaign, and despite initial resistance from multinational pharmaceutical companies, the government of Brazil was able to negotiate price reductions for HIV medications and develop local production capacity, thereby averting a public health disaster. Using interview data and document analysis, the authors show that the exercise of corporate social responsibility can be viewed in practice as a dynamic negotiation and an interaction between multiple actors. Action undertaken in terms of voluntary CSR alone may be insufficient. This finding highlights the importance of a strong role for national governments and international organizations to pressure companies to perform better.

AB The new paradigm of the ICT technology does not alter much the explanations that we get through the dependency theory - whether it is infrastructure or equipment or high-end consultancy.
   Today, services as economic activity dominate the world. It constitutes the dominant share of the GDP of the Developed countries and the world. Its share is also increasing in world exports. With the global society becoming knowledge-based integrated economy in this digital age, policy makers in every country are putting more emphasis on this sector. Developed countries have already gained competitive advantage in services and therefore to suit their interests are justifiably demanding global rules and regulations governing services sector and progressive liberalisation of these sectors.
   The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) became the first multilateral agreement, under the aegis of the Uruguay Round, to provide legally enforceable rights to trade in a wide range of services along with their progressive liberalisation. Although there are arguments that suggest that "GATS provides developing countries with an opportunity to integrate into the global economy through adopting more liberal policies with regard to trade in services", these fall short of dwelling further on the nature of relationship among nations in such a liberal environment. Telecommunications services are a global market worth over US$ 1.5 trillion in revenue. Mobile services account for roughly 40 per cent of this, while mobile subscribers worldwide currently outnumber the use of fixed telephone lines by more than two to one. Over the past decade, the market has witnessed far-reaching changes, with the introduction of competition into a sector that was once principally a monopoly. Telecommunication service is core to many services, whether it be banking, entertainment, travel, or any other. Telecommunications is often referred to as Core services facilitating the delivery of services produced by other sectors as well as generating its own processing, transaction and delivery, of services. Of the services sector, telecommunication sector is fast becoming the key sector of any progressive and developed economy. The systemic benefits of a mature and modern telecommunication sector are tremendous. All the benefits of liberalised trade in services are duly applicable to trade in telecommunication, namely, 1) services could bring huge benefits over the next 50 years; 2) allowing foreign suppliers to compete with domestic ones a) lowers prices, b) improves quality, c) increases choice., d) increases access to vitally needed technology, and e) increases access to capital investment in infrastructure; 3) services could increase efficiency of manufacturing activities, particularly those which use many types of services such as telecommunication., banking, insurance, accountancy, and transports systems. Besides these general arguments in favour of liberlaised trade in services, telecommunication liberalisation can bring improvement in economic efficiency of many sectors that use telecommunication services, like, electronic commerce, software development, hospital services, as well as many other sectors like agriculture, and manufacturing. In fact, in times to come., there will not be any sector, which would not benefit from the telecommunication services. And in that sense, it has an all pervasive beneficial effect on the national economy of developing and developed economies of the world. The present paper is a study to focus on the interests of the developing countries and therefore., there is a major caution that has to be kept in mind and that is of dependency on the technology which is primarily controlled by MNC's hailing from developed economies of USA, Europe, Japan or Australia. Even Canada and Korea may be included in this list. In the net terms, does an argument in favour of liberalised telecommunication sector stands the test of scrutiny. To understand, and analyse., may be we look at some of major developments of last four decades in brief, and of the current decade in detail with a focus on cellular services. As such, wireless internet and mobile commerce and services are the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
   And supposing our analysis suggests to the contrary, do we have alternatives, which better serve the national interests of developing countries. What are the implications of WTO Agreement on Basic Telecom Services in 1997? What relationship it establishes among natios of the world with regard to telecommunication industry? What are the implications of convergence on telecommunication, and other sectors of the economy? Is it good or bad for developing countries? Do these countries have choice?

TI From Seattle to Hong Kong: Are We Getting Anywhere?
SO GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL
AB With agricultural trade negotiations deadlocked, the Doha round of trade talks may appear dead in the water. But every round of trade talks in recent memory has oscillated between near breakthroughs and near breakdowns. Trade negotiations can be like a ride on a roller coaster but, while the roller coaster returns to where it started, multilateral trade negotiations have generally gone on to close successfully. Will this happen with the Doha round? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. Prospects for concluding the round in Hong Kong next month, at the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting, are indeed bleak; but not the prospects for finishing later.
   While the initial attempt to launch the WTO's first round of multilateral trade negotiations in Seattle in November 1999 collapsed, the round was finally launched in Doha, Qatar, two years later, with reaffirmation of the twin virtues of democracy and openness to the world economy. While there was a lot of dissent in September 2003 at the next WTO meeting in Cancun, which also collapsed because of the lack of consensus especially on agricultural liberalization, there were nonetheless some important accomplishments in the tabling of most of the "Singapore issues" and an agreement to relax the TRIPS Agreement to permit developing country access to low-cost pharmaceuticals. Cancun was also a turning point insofar as the major developing countries coalesced in the Group of 20 to provide greater balance in the WTO membership and the design of the negotiating agenda.
   While it appears that agricultural liberalization is still a significant stumbling block facing the Hong Kong Ministerial, it is likely that the EU can be squeezed if there are reciprocal offers in manufactures and services that are forthcoming especially from some of the major developing countries that can be induced to liberalize in their own interests. It will also be helpful if a program of adjustment assistance can be devised in the form of "aid for trade" especially for low-income countries. The outlines of a deal to close the Doha Round are therefore clear.
   With forceful leadership on the part of Pascal Lamy to rescue the Doha Round in Hong Kong and to convince the WTO member states to follow with an extraordinary meeting within six months, it should be possible to take the penultimate steps to bring the Doha Round to a final conclusion by the end of 2006 and to obtain its approval by early 2007 before the U.S. fast-track negotiating authority expires.

TI WTO dispute settlement and the missing developing country cases:
   Engaging the private sector
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The poorest WTO member countries almost universally fail to engage as either complainants or interested third parties in formal dispute settlement activity related to their market access interests. This paper focuses on costs of the WTO's extended litigation process as an explanation for the potential but 'missing' developing country engagement. We provide a positive examination of the current system, and we catalogue and analyze a set of proposals encouraging the private sector to provide DSU-specific legal assistance to poor countries. We investigate the role of legal service centres, non-governmental organizations, development organizations, international trade litigators, economists, consumer organizations, and law schools to provide poor countries with the services needed at critical stages of the WTO's extended litigation process. In the absence of systemic rules reform, the public-private partnership model imposes a substantial cooperation burden on such groups as they organize export interests, estimate the size of improved market access payoffs, prioritize across potential cases, engage domestic governments, prepare legal briefs, assist in evidentiary discovery, and pursue the public relations effort required to induce foreign political compliance.

TI Globalization and Voluntary Environmental Management in Developing

SO FRONTIERS OF ECONOMICS IN CHINA
AB Weak capacity to enforce regulations and sanction violators, and an emphasis on economic growth in developing countries has led to concerns about worsening environmental conditions and the potential for these countries becoming pollution havens for multinational corporations. International environmental standards, voluntary programs, and public disclosure programs have gained popularity because they engage market participants in providing incentives for self-regulation and have the potential to substitute for the lack of domestic regulatory capacity. This paper analyzes the motivations for firms to undertake voluntary environmental management and reviews the empirical evidence on the type of firms participating in such initiatives and their effectiveness in improving environmental performance. We also consider the special case of China that has witnessed dramatic globalization following its acceptance into the World Trade Organization and participation by its firms in global supply chains. We conclude with a discussion of the effectiveness of these efforts as a substitute for weak regulatory and civic society pressures in these countries.

TI A contract theory approach to special and differential treatment and the
   WTO
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - This paper is prompted by the dissatisfaction of developing countries regarding the grant of special and differential treatment (SDT) under the legal framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As a result of such dissatisfaction, the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations explicitly called for a review of such treatment with a view to making it more precise, effective and operational. This mandate has not yet been met to the satisfaction of many developing countries. This paper aims to provide an alternative way of examining and evaluating the contestation which exists regarding SDT in the WTO.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses the conceptual framework provided by the economic contract theory and in particular, the concept of the incomplete contract to provide a scaffold for analysing SDT. This approach is intended to offer insights beyond those elucidated so far in the literature on the topic.
   Findings - This paper, by using an economic contract theory approach, finds that SDT is constructed as an incomplete contract. Furthermore, the suboptimal outcomes associated with incomplete contracts are apparent in the constitution of SDT. This finding is useful in both an evaluative and programmatic sense, providing us with an alternative entry point to explain some of the shortcomings with SDT, as well as garnering us with a useful conceptual tool to think upon how SDT can be improved.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature on SDT within the WTO in particular and differential treatment in international law in general. Drawing on literature on the WTO as an incomplete contract, the paper provides an original frame for analyzing SDT and draws attention, in particular, to the utility of the economic contract theory as a programmatic and evaluative frame for SDT and differential treatment more generally.

TI Tariff escalation, export shares and economy-wide welfare: A computable
   general equilibrium approach
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB The current literature suggests that tariff escalation (TE) lowers the competitiveness of processing sectors. Coffee and cotton are agricultural products that face the problem of TE in developing countries, where we observe low global coffee product export shares but high global cotton textile export shares, posing a question on TE's impact on competitiveness. This paper employs a computable generalised equilibrium (CGE) modelling approach to examine the impact of TE on export shares of processed coffee and cotton textiles. We modify the standard GTAP (global trade analysis project) model to solve for global export shares and simulate the impact of eliminating TE on coffee and cotton to analyse economy-wide trade and welfare implications. Results show that TE has mixed effects on export shares, depending on the initial economic structure. Findings reveal that the elimination of TE on cotton and coffee may generate potential global gains of over US$ 0.7 billion, mainly from the cotton sector. Given the relative size of these sectors in global agriculture, the magnitude of gains is not small. This underlines the need for the policy-makers to examine, address and evaluate the prevalence of TE on a sectoral basis in ongoing WTO negotiations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Shattering the Myths About US Trade Policy
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Many Americans blame free trade for their nation's economic slide, but the authors' research shows that free trade has been assigned a villainous role that far exceeds its real impact. The evidence exposes three myths.
   Myth 1: America's open trade policy is the main cause of job losses, especially in manufacturing. The real drivers of the tosses: rising productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing and a shift in demand away from goods in favor of services.
   Myth 2: U.S. living standards are falling and wage inequality is rising because developing countries compete with the U.S. in its export markets on cost. The truth is that the U.S. and developing countries have specialized in very different products and processes, making the latter complementary to America's growth.
   Myth 3: The rapid growth of emerging markets like China and India is the most important reason for the higher oil prices that hurt Americans. The primary responsibility for the shortfall between demand and supply that has caused oil prices to soar rests with developed countries, which contributed to most of the price increase from 2000 to 2008.
   The authors advocate a more active U.S. trade policy that emphasizes exports, bilateral cooperation with other economies to maintain a trading order that supports U.S. economic interests, and plurilateral agreements with WTO members on issues such as competition policy.

AB The dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been treated as the most effective mechanism in terms of international rule of law since it was born. The objective of the dispute settlement system is providing the multilateral trading system with security and predictability. There are three types of remedy under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (commonly known as the DSU) that designed for breach of WTO law. 1 The first one is withdrawal of the measures that are inconsistent with the WTO covered agreements, which is a final remedy. Another two remedies are temporary remedies, the compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations 2 under the covered agreements. This is the compliance-compensation-retaliation remedy system under the DSU of the WTO. 3 Among these remedies, effectiveness can be seen. However, these remedies also have their own shortage, especially when the developing countries using them. The purpose of the essay is through showing the remedies under the DSU to demonstrate both the significance and deficiency of this remedy system, especially its impacts on the developed and developing countries.

TI Developing Country Success in WTO Disputes
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Developing county participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) has been studied extensively in the literature, with many scholars concluding that developing countries are underrepresented due to a lack of domestic legal capacity. I expand study of developing countries in the DSM by looking at legal capacity's role in the panel stage of disputes. I consider the impact of newly available legal aid and create a novel measure for legal expertise that draws from domestic Supreme Court literature. I find that legal capacity variables are not the predictors of success; panel decisions are driven by strategic considerations.

SO EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB We explore three questions on foreign direct investment (FDI): (1) What are the differences in entry barriers for foreign, public, and private investors? (2) What are the effects of past productivity levels on future foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions? (3) What is the effect of equity structure on future total factor productivity (TFP) levels? The empirical results based on a monopolistic competition model and using a firm-level data set from the Chinese automobile industry suggest that foreign investors face higher entry barriers and react stronger to past TFP levels. FDI is also found to improve future TFP more than other forms of investment. Finally, World Trade Organization (WTO) accession is found to reduce entry barriers for foreign and domestic private investors while increasing entry barriers for public investors.

TI Effect of the duration of membership in the GATT/WTO on economic growth
   volatility
SO STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB This article investigates how the duration of membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs , Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) affects economic growth volatility. Using an unbalanced panel dataset of 153 countries over the period 1980-2019, it has revealed that the duration of membership in the GATT/WTO reduces economic growth volatility, with this negative effect being larger in member states that have been subject to rigorous accession procedures. More importantly, the membership duration exerts a larger dampening economic growth volatility effect as countries further upgrade their export products. It also exerts a larger negative effect on economic growth volatility in countries that enjoy a greater openness to international trade. These findings complement the findings of the positive economic growth effect of the membership in the GATT/ WTO, by showing that more than the mere membership in the GATT/WTO, the duration of such membership affects economic growth volatility.

TI The Emergence of New R&D Paradigms in the Indian Pharmaceutical
   Industry: Post TRIPS Period
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
AB India, being a signatory of WTO agreements, has moved from no or partial patent protection to full fledged patent protection. This represents a radical break from the past in which developing countries typically had only weak levels of patent protection. In this context, this research examines the steps involved in development of R&D capabilities in the Indian pharmaceutical firms as a response to strengthening of patent law. This paper analyses the post-TRIPS behaviour of domestic pharmaceutical firms in India with respect to R&D intensification, development of new molecules and enhanced DMF filings. The study establishes that firms in the post WTO era have increased their R&D efforts tremendously and are moving towards the development of advance level process and product R&D capabilities. Such firms have also opted for vigorous DMF filings abroad reflecting qualitative modifications and adjustments in its R&D capabilities in the production of exportables.

TI Estimating the effects of global patent protection in pharmaceuticals: A
   case study of quinolones in India
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Under the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights, the World Trade Organization members are required to enforce product patents for pharmaceuticals. In this paper we empirically investigate the welfare effects of this requirement on developing countries using data for the fuoroquinolones subsegment of the systemic anti-bacterials segment of the Indian pharmaceuticals market. Our results suggest that concerns about the potential adverse welfare effects of TRIPS may have some basis. We estimate that the withdrawal of all domestic products in this subsegment is associated with substantial welfare losses to the Indian economy, even in the presence of price regulation. The overwhelming portion of this welfare loss derives from the loss of consumer welfare.

TI Examining the Legality of Affordability Requirements as a Substantive
   Condition for Granting Compulsory Licences Pursuant to the TRIPS
   Agreement
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB This article examines whether the so-called reasonably affordable requirements of the public remains a valid condition under TRIPS on which World Trade Organisation members can grant compulsory licences. This article frames its analysis around Section 84 of the Indian Patent Act 1970 in relation to the compulsory licencing case between Bayer vs Natco. The author argues that despite the reasonably affordable requirements of the public not one of the common grounds on which members normally pursue for granting compulsory licences the fact that India has used similar provisions under its TRIPS-compliant patent regime in granting a compulsory licence to Natco significantly validates the affordability requirements of the public as an independent condition that is consistent with TRIPS on which members can grant compulsory licences. This conclusion is premised on the understanding that no member state has even attempted to challenge the legality of India's decision before the WTO, under the dispute settlement understanding system and that paucity is more supportive of the thesis that, nothing in the light of TRIPS would, in fact, preclude the possibility of other developing countries amending their patent laws to demand that as substantive conditions patentees must satisfy the reasonably affordable requirements of the public.

TI WTO regulation of subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - A
   critical appraisal of the China Accession protocol
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The existence of a large number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China and government subsidies to them has caused much concern among its trading partners. The Protocol on China's Accession to the WTO sets out certain provisions directly or indirectly addressing this concern. Among them are the provisions of an SOE-based specificity test and authorization for the importing country to use, on a permanent basis, alternative benchmarks in identifying and calculating Chinese subsidies. In addition, the Protocol excludes China from invoking the privatization exception available to developing country members under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. This article provides a critical analysis of the Protocol approach towards the issue of SOE subsidies and examines its implications for economic reform in China and for the WTO legal system.

TI Tariffs on agricultural imports from developing countries for protecting
   their environment and resources?
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
AB International trade measures are frequently mentioned as instruments for meeting environmental objectives. Their potential role and their effects depend on environmental concepts which are really pursued. One of these concepts is to apply environmentally sound agricultural production systems and procedures in developing countries. The accompanying trade measure could be establishing import tariffs on environmentally harmful products from these countries. This hypothesis is analysed along five criteria: market efficiency, environmental effects of trade barriers, compatibility with WTO rules, procedural problems and probability of achieving international consensus.
   Trade measures may be efficient under certain conditions. Yet, in practices, such a set of necessary conditions can be realized only through high control interventions.
   With respect to effectiveness of such a measure evaluation has shown that import duties will rarely give incentives in the exporting country to introduce or to adopt environmentally more friendly production procedures. There are a great deal of possibilities to circumvent such constraints.
   Import restrictions differentiated by product origin is not consistent with WTO rules. But some details of these rules and procedures are in an evolving process in order to respond to new problems and challenges. In recent years some decisions of the Dispute Settlement Body have opened the way for a more environmentally oriented interpretation. Nevertheless, taking into account the fundamental WTO principles, trade policy could not be transformed in an instrument for pushing environmental protection and resources conservation.
   Trade measures are not the first step for coping with environmental problems in developing countries. First, environmental friendly production procedures should be tested, adopted and spread over these countries. As second step such initiatives should be covered by international agreements upon resource and environment protecting measures. The environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 adopted a set of principles which have been used since as basis for negotiation initiatives between exporting and importing countries. If, after these steps, trade measures are considered as useful or necessary the international community should not hesitate to take such steps.

TI International Labour Standards and North-South Competition
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper models the economic aspects of labour standards (LS) in an oligopolistic framework of three countries, incorporating labour-management negotiations in the North and monopsonic labour markets in Southern countries. Contrary to the literature, a higher LS not only incurs a higher cost, but also benefits workers and induces them to work harder. Because of these links, Northern intervention, via import taxes or minimum LS regulation, may often have perverse effects on Southern countries. Specifically, imposing an unconditional tariff against a certain Southern country to force up its LS does not work. Further, the unconditional tariff would shift production to another country. These shed light on why developing countries oppose including LS in WTO negotiations. However, a LS-contingent tariff, or a minimum LS regulation is effective in raising LS in Southern countries, but the utility of the Northern labour union may fall. Incorporating altruism and humanitarian concerns mitigates the effects of unconditional tariff policies. Finally, as the empirical evidence shows, we demonstrate that multinational enterprises choose to locate in those developing countries whose LS is relatively higher.

AB Since its conception in early 1990s, cleaner production has helped thousands of businesses around the world in improving environmental performance and reducing risks to their staff. Developing countries, due to their economic, social and cultural limitations are slow to adapt to new ideas. Stresses of WTO and ISO certification are hitting the developing economies hard especially the export businesses. This article re-introduces the concept of cleaner production as a self-help tool as well as an economical pathway towards ISO certification. The objective is to motivate businesses anywhere to join the sustainable development trail. A simple step-by-step procedure to develop a cleaner production program is delineated. Cleaner production opportunities and how their exploration will lead to covering many requirements of the ISO14001:2004 certification is discussed. Cleaner production opportunities in the most common automotive industry are presented along with five case studies from Australia. Special attention is given to energy efficiency.

TI The Newest UN Treaty to Facilitate Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia
   and the Pacific: An Insight Preview
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific (Framework Agreement) is a new United Nations (UN) treaty adopted at the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in May 2016. It is now open for the signature of the ESCAP Member States till September 2017. As the most recent UN treaty on trade and development, the Framework Agreement will be an important development as well as a complement to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation (WTO TFA), which is effective since February 2017. The Framework Agreement creates unprecedentedly the new multilateral legal framework for facilitation of cross-border paperless trade. While maintaining the balance between international trade efficiency, transparency, regulatory compliance and development stimulation, the Framework Agreement crafts the legal mechanisms to harmonize the Member States' national paperless trade facilities through implementing a common set of the general principles and the relevant international standards and legal instruments. Most significantly, the Framework Agreement creatively enables cross-border mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents in electronic form through its institutional arrangement and supporting operational mechanisms. The Framework Agreement also provides a dedicated intergovernmental platform for capacity building and technical assistance to enable developing countries (including the least-developed countries and landlocked developing countries) to benefit from paperless trade facilitation. The Framework Agreement will open up the new possibilities for trade facilitation and is particularly important for the development of cross-border e-commerce and global digital economy. Its impact and influence will not only be felt in Asia-Pacific region but in the whole world. There has been very few substantive research on this newest treaty law. The Author who has been the primary legal advisor of UNESCAP for the initial research, drafting, negotiation and implementation of the Framework Agreement since 2011 is able to provide the insights on both the legal texts and the in-depth designs of the Agreement.

Our empirical analysis uses a panel dataset covering 169 countries from 1995 to 2013 to provide evidence that multilateral trade policy liberalization does have a positive impact on government revenue. However, this impact appears to be dependent upon both countries' level of development and their level of domestic trade policy liberalization. This finding highlights the importance for members of the World Trade Organization to promote multilateral trade liberalization. Further, restrictive domestic trade policies, which could undermine multilateralization efforts, will ultimately weaken the positive impact of multilateral trade liberalization on government revenues.

TI WTO for trade and development post-Doha
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The WTO Members' negotiations under the Doha mandate on special and differential treatment ('SDT') and development issues have made little progress. The gap between developed countries and developing countries in this regard seems too wide to be bridged. This gap originates from a fundamental difference in their basic stances on cross-cutting issues. In principle, without prejudice to currently available SDT under individual WTO Agreements, developing countries should be given flexibilities in implementing WTO rules, which may result in the rebalancing of rights and obligations of WTO Members but only when policy measures at issue can contribute to particular developing countries' development needs and no alternative less-trade restrictive measures are reasonably available. After reviewing WTO Members' discussions since the adoption of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, this article suggests a 'measure-specific ex ante approach' for a workable solution to bridging the gap between developed countries and developing countries on SDT and development issues.

TI The First Five Decades of Cooperation for Development. Actors,
   Achievements and Challenges
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB The sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development collectively serve as a universal guide for developed and developing countries in their national policies and international cooperation aimed at combating global challenges. The SDGs build on the outcomes of the Global Partnership for Development Co-operation (GPEDC), the foundations of which were laid in the 20th century. This article explores the system of international development cooperation as it evolved in the UN from 1946 until the adoption of the UN Millennium Declaration in 2000. It analyzes the resolutions and official records of the main UN bodies, with emphasis on the General Assembly (GA) and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Content analysis of the records reveals the delegations' positions, interests, contradictions and tensions which may have been concealed by the smooth text of the resolutions.
   Four development decades culminated in adoption of the Millennium Declaration. Each stage had its achievements and problems. The main principles, mechanisms and areas of cooperation were molded in early sessions of the GA and ECOSOC. The creation of development support instruments began in mid-1940s, when the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and later the UN Special Fund were established. The dollar monopoly was entrenched. The expansion of international trade and removal of barriers to trade issues gained prominence in UN resolutions in the 1950s. In 1960 the goal of increasing flows of assistance and capital to developing countries to 1% of the combined national incomes of economically developed countries was set for the first time.
   The period from 1961-1970 was marked by the adoption of the Programme for International Development Co-operation - including the First United Nations Development Decade and the World Food Programme (WFP), the establishment of the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and by the elaboration of the international development strategy for the second development decade. The need for international monetary reform was debated in conjunction with the UN's pursuit of a solution to the problems of rising debt and international liquidity.
   The key milestones of the second decade include the gradual integration of development and environment issues, efforts to resolve the international monetary crisis and alleviate the rising debt burden, an increase of pledged targets for the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the WFP and Special Fund, the decision on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, efforts to implement the differential treatment principle with regard to developing countries within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, and a failed attempt to launch "global negotiations on restructuring of international economic relations on the basis of the principles of justice and equality in order to provide for steady economic development."
   In the third decade, progress was made toward strengthening the science and technology capacity as well as the industrial and resource development capacity of developing countries. The UN endorsed the Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000, adopted the Declaration on the Right to Development and the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. The transition to a sustainable development model was a major achievement. The economic recession, high rates of interest, inflation and mounting deficits, the problems of liquidity and balance of payments, protectionism and structural imbalances in the world economy required a comprehensive decision on the reform of the international monetary system. However, global negotiations were deadlocked due to the position taken by the Group of 7 (G7) that the independence of the specialized agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be guaranteed. Despite efforts by the Group of 77 (G77) to deal comprehensively with the full range of economic issues, the G7's insistence on the 1982 Versailles summit formula blocked global negotiations, defining the system's rigidity for many years to come and contributing to its failure to prevent the 1998 and 2008 crises.
   The Agenda for Development adopted in June 1997 and the UN Millennium Declaration adopted in September 2000 became the landmarks of the fourth decade and development cooperation history.
   The international community came a long way in building and consolidating development cooperation in the second half of the 20th century. The UN became a cradle and a driver of this process and was a factor in its success. Indisputable achievements resulting from collective efforts over 55 years include a consistent consolidation of its foundational programme documents from the first development decade to the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs), continuous improvement of the review and appraisal process, integration of environmental issues into the development agenda, establishment of key development cooperation institutions and a significant increase in financing for development. However, efforts to create the conditions for sustained progress and development restructuring of the international economic system taking account of the interests of developing countries failed. The 21st century inherited the systemic problems of the international monetary and trade systems.

TI Has the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in Latin America and the
   Caribbean produced intellectual property legislation that favours public
   health?
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Objective The World Trade Organization's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property rights, including patent protection for pharmaceuticals; therefore, it may make it difficult for developing countries to gain access to medicines, especially those countries that are the least developed. This study aims to determine whether implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in Latin American and Caribbean countries has generated patent legislation that is sensitive to public health needs.
   Methods Legislation in 11 Latin American and Caribbean countries was analysed. The variables considered in the analysis were: the term of patents issued, patentable subject matter, transition periods (that is, time until legislation was enacted), reversal of the burden of proof of patent infringement, exhaustion of rights, compulsory licensing and the early working exception (which allows a country to complete all procedures necessary to register a generic product before the original patent expires).
   Findings By 2000, all of the countries studied had reformed their legislation to conform to the agreement. Brazil and Argentina used the transition period until 2005 to grant patents in the pharmaceutical industry. All countries, except Panama, made use of the safeguards and flexibilities available through the agreement by including mechanisms for compulsory licensing in their legislation. Argentina; Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela (countries that represented the Andean community); the Dominican Republic; and Panama included mechanisms to allow parallel importation. Mexico did not. Brazil only permits parallel importation after a compulsory licence has been issued. The early working exception is included in legislation in Brazil and the Dominican Republic.
   Conclusion The countries in this study did not incorporate all of the mechanisms allowed for by the Agreement and are not adequately using the provisions that enable World Trade Organization (WTO) members to obtain better health for the public, particularly in regard to gaining access to medicines. This situation may deteriorate in future if other agreements establish more restrictive rules for intellectual property rights.

TI REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF WTO LAW: THE MISPLACED NOTION OF
   EFFECTIVENESS
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB The paper attempts to critically review the WTO remedies for violation of WTO agreements. The paper argues that while the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) has achieved significant procedural advancements, particularly in the area of compulsory jurisdiction and predictability, the DSU has also taken a step backward, narrowing the scope of remedies available for injured complaining Members. Primarily, a Member's responsibility for a breach of a WTO obligation appears to be more restricted than a state's responsibility for a breach of an international obligation under general international law and even the 1947 GATT era. In other words, what an injured member could expect as a remedy for violation of a WTO obligation is limited by the special rules under the DSU. Similar is the case with DSU countermeasures which is authorized automatically, however, is essentially bilateral in operational terms and therefore, inflicted with the political and economic imbalances that inform the remedy of countermeasures.

AB This paper discusses what could be done to expand services trade and investment through a multilateral agreement in the WTO. A distinction is made between market access liberalization and the regulatory preconditions for benefiting from market opening. We argue that prospects for multilateral services liberalization would be enhanced by making national treatment the objective of WTO services negotiations. Moreover, if complemented by assistance to strengthen regulatory capacity in developing countries, the WTO could become more relevant in promoting not just services liberalization but, more importantly, domestic reforms of services policies.

CL LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA
SP Western Agr Econ Assoc
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture was signed in June 1994. It accomplished two things: it brought agricultural trade under the rules of WTO, and it set schedules for reducing barriers to trade under the three pillars of liberalization-market access, export assistance, and domestic support. Nine years later there has been precious little liberalization. The new Doha Round has ambitious objectives for agricultural trade liberalization. However, given recent behavior by rich developed countries, it seems unlikely that developing countries will get increased access to Northern markets or reduced competition from subsidized exports, despite their now representing a majority of WTO members.

TI WTO post Doha: trade deadlocks and protectionism
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - At its inception, the Doha Round offered the hope of a more inclusive World Trade Organisation (WTO); one where developing countries in particular envisioned would allow them the policy space to enable their socio-economic advancement even as they carried out their obligations as Member States of the rules-based international trade system. While the rewards of this novel development round are awaited, WTO Member States are making a marked shift away from the foundation principles of multilateralism on non-discriminatory treatment, and pursuing independent trade deals outside the rules. An emerging acceptance of this shift comes with an idea that countries can converge after divergence - that alternatives to multilateralism can still yield agreements that will operate in a multilateral rules-based framework, post Doha. To this end, this article reviews the challenges facing the Doha negotiations as it pertains to developing country concerns and the shortcomings of the existing development framework. It critically examines the issues arising from the stalemate of the Doha negotiations and the efforts of the international trading system to continue engaging in trade in the face of globalisation, increasing unemployment, decreased wages and living standards in the backdrop of a global recession. It examines the emerging convergence theory which recognises departures from the uniform trading arrangements under multilateralism, without recognising this as a tacit acceptance of a return to protectionism with its consequences. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Reference is made to primary and secondary research material on the subject including WTO rules and agreements.
   Findings - The article finds that the stalemate in this Doha Round reveals more than just dissatisfaction between Member States on the nature and scope of the rules that must guide their global trading activities. It reveals the fragility of rules and the potential inefficacy of a system that attempts to regulate nebulous activity - trade in the face of divergent needs and concerns.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is library/desk based.
   Originality/value - This work is an original contribution and is not under consideration elsewhere.

TI Changing global essential medicines norms to improve access to AIDS
   treatment: Lessons from Brazil
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Brazil's large-scale, successful HIV/AIDS treatment programme is considered by many to be a model for other developing countries aiming to improve access to AIDS treatment. Far less is known about Brazil's important role in changing global norms related to international pharmaceutical policy, particularly international human rights, health and trade policies governing access to essential medicines. Prompted by Brazil's interest in preserving its national AIDS treatment policies during World Trade Organisation trade disputes with the USA, these efforts to change global essential medicines norms have had important implications for other countries, particularly those scaling up AIDS treatment. This paper analyses Brazil's contributions to global essential medicines policy and explains the relevance of Brazil's contributions to global health policy today.

By comparing the Nash equilibrium IPR protection standard of the South (the developing countries) with that of the North (the developed countries), we find that the former is naturally weaker than the latter. Moreover, we show that both regions can gain from an agreement that requires the South to harmonize its IPR standards with those of the North, and the North to liberalize its traditional goods market. This demonstrates the merits of multi-sectoral negotiations in the GATT/WTO. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Informal Learning and WTO Renewal Using Thematic Sessions to Create More
   Opportunities for Dialogue
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB 'Thematic sessions' bring dynamism to WTO by allowing committees to consider what works well under an agreement, including sharing experiences with implementation, what is not working, and what is next on the agenda. Thematic sessions are a broad class of meetings that are sponsored by or associated with a WTO body in some way, but that are not part of its formal meetings. The WTO held over 100 such sessions in the three years from 2017 to 2019. We found variation in how meetings are organized, which is related to the type of session, and we found variation in how themes are chosen, participation (who speaks), the degree of transparency, and funding. Comprehensive improvement is needed: some committees never hold thematic sessions, participation by capital-based officials from developing countries is uneven, and too few sessions have a forward-looking agenda. Enhanced use of thematic sessions can contribute to strengthening the pipeline between Geneva and capitals, and to better understanding in Geneva of what is happening on the ground.

TI What is so special about CAI?
SO ASIA PACIFIC LAW REVIEW
AB This article examines the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in the light of investment chapters contained in trade agreements that China and the EU have signed (separately obviously) with two countries: the Republic of Korea, like most EU countries, a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Vietnam, a developing country and a nonmarket economy, where, like in China, state-owned enterprises play a substantial role. We find that the CAI innovates compared to these earlier trade agreements in some important dimensions, especially as far as the commitments accepted by China are concerned. Hence, the bilateral EU-China investment agreement could be useful for a future multilateral agreement in areas where current WTO rules do not provide sufficient discipline for countries like China.

AB Twenty first century is an era when competition progressively increases within the global economy. That's mainly because the countries abandon their protectionist economic policies under the scope of GATT and WTO which they normally follow. In global world of today, it's impossible to provide protection by means of custom duties and quotas. The most important advantage of such developing countries as Turkey and China within such progressively increasing global competitive environment, is small and medium sized enterprises. Small and medium sized enterprises in such countries as Turkey and China which recently undergo a rapid paced economic growth process, have very important roles in terms of their contribution to economy and especially to employment.
   SMEs within the global competitive environment of today, are under the pressure of competition in both Turkey and global economy. Their ability to survive and contribute to economy under global economical environment, is based on their ability to follow the technological innovations. SMEs which have important places in developing the national economies within the competitive environment as created by the globalization process, have significant places especially in such developing countries as Turkey, in terms of jobs they create.
   SMEs have a flexible structure since they are small and medium sized enterprises. Thanks to these features, they adapt to changes in the global world, faster than the larger enterprises. For this reason, they have important roles in protecting the national economies from the adverse effects of the global competition. Thanks to their local characteristics, they form the foundation of the national economies. They also make social contribution to country's economy by empowering the middle class by means of the jobs they are creating in local environment.
   Creating large sized and globally competitive enterprises in developing countries like Turkey, is dependent on the consistent small and medium sized enterprises policies to be followed. In order to do that, it's inevitable to create a healthy infrastructure. SMEs in the countries where such policies are successfully implemented, have become the most dynamic enterprises of the economy and were minimally influenced by the adverse effects of the global competition.
   SMEs, recently has become dynamo of Turkish economy, their contribution to local employment was increased, their importance in the economy increased thanks to dynamic and flexible structures facilitating social transition. Importance of SMEs in Turkish economy increases day by day since they prevent estrangement and contribute to empowerment of middle class by creating jobs. These enterprises have recently become a guarantee of economic and political stability, security of the democracy in social and political development of Turkey.
   In this paper contributions of SMEs to national economy (Turkish economy) within the globalization process, shall be pointed out, SMEs contributions to development of Turkish economy by comparing definitions of SME in Turkey and EU, shall be investigated and analyzed, their dynamic roles in development of the country and their positive effects in the social domain shall be attempted to be discovered.

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Recent scholarship raises a number of questions about how countries at different income levels use the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). It is generally accepted that countries with large trade volumes will use the DSU more than smaller economies. It stands to reason that developed countries would also be faster to participate in dispute settlement processes after acceding to the WTO Agreement. This article shows that economic development status does not explain the speed at which members engage in dispute settlement following accession. In fact, there is less uniformity in the pace at which members undertake dispute settlement than might be expected given the global divisions of wealth, access to information and availability of legal talent.

SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB The development of antidumping (hereinafter "AD') policy has been the most frequently used method of contingent protection in the past twenty years. In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis employing a panel dataset of World Trade Organization (hereinafter "WTO') members from 1995 to 2018 to explore the determinants of AD policy based on the theoretical framework of the three Is (interests, interactions, and institutions) of the international political economy. We found that AD policymaking was a product of the interplay of interests, interactions, and institutions. Regarding interests, we found that the demands of interest groups and political pressure from export -oriented industries counterbalanced AD protection. Regarding interactions, the more WTO members disputing petitions, the stronger the motivation on the part of target countries to retaliate by initiating AD investigations. Regarding institutions, more democratic countries with WTO membership tended to initiate more AD investigations. These findings have implications for industries, national governments, and the WTO in improving the fairness and legitimacy of the global trade governance system.

TI Developing-country status at the WTO: the divergent strategies of

SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB The global power shift towards Brazil, India, China and other non-western powers has led to pressures to adjust international institutions to new economic realities. Most power shift theories assume that established powers defend their institutional privileges, while emerging powers challenge them. Conversely, in this article we reverse this assumption by shedding light on 'privileges' of the weak: many international institutions have established special rights for disadvantaged regime members. We ask what strategies emerging powers adopt as they come under pressure to give up these rights commonly reserved for regime members with developing country status. We present a novel conceptualization of four ideal-typical strategies that combine elements of resistance and accommodation. Empirically, we examine the strategies that Brazil, India and China (BICs) have adopted in the World Trade Organization. We find that no uniform approach exists across the BICs: while India fiercely resists giving up its status as a developing country and the flexibilities it comes with, Brazil adopts a pragmatic approach that largely accommodates established powers' demands to give up special rights reserved for developing countries. China pursues a mixed strategy of selective accommodation and resistance. These findings contribute to recent debates on global power shifts by illustrating how material incentives and status considerations shape the adaptation of international institutions as privileges for the weak are re-negotiated.
   Most power shift theories assume that established powers defend their institutional privileges, while emerging powers challenge them. However, this article examines how Brazil, India and China have come under pressure to give up their institutional privileges at the WTO, and the differing strategies they have adopted.

On the other side, government provide subsidies to alleviate poverty and improve fishermen's welfare. A number of countries, especially developed countries encourage the elimination of fisheries subsidies through WTO and other countries, especially developing countries opposed the proposal of the developed countries. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make a balance between community development and environmental protection in case of fisheries subsidies. This study reviews the implementation of fisheries subsidies in Indonesia. The research is based on a literacy study along with data and information on fishery subsidies that have been carried out so far by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries as an authorized government agency. The results of the study indicate that there are benefits from providing subsidies to the welfare of fishermen and also support the sustainability of fisheries resources.

TI International Posturing amidst Domestic Neglect: India's Agricultural
   Policy Examined
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB India has actively tried to shape the WTO agricultural negotiations by submitting detailed proposals, building coalitions, and even taking hard stands (veto) at critical junctures. However, this aggressive posturing presents a sharp contrast with India's domestic agricultural space, where the situation highlights policy neglect, manifesting in agrarian distress and farmer suicides. This paper analyzes contradictions between India's internationally espoused negotiating positions and its domestic policy goals. It argues that India's core focus has been to preserve status quo in the domestic food markets, driven by the political need to provide food-based consumption subsidies and manage an assured price and supply protection to its vulnerable consumers. As a result, India's interests are divergent from most of its developing country coalition partners in the G-20 as well as the G-33 groups. Our discussion has significant implications for both the domestic policy, as well as the sustainability of India's strategy in global agricultural trade negotiations.

The article demonstrates that while India's reform diplomacy has consistently been pursued across these institutions, India has maintained the same approach to reform even after its position in certain institutions has improved. In explaining this condition, the article argues that Indian leaders strive to improve the country's position in global governance but maintain that India has not yet reached a position through which it can unilaterally identify new objectives for reform. For this reason, India remains dependent upon coalitions with emerging powers and developing countries in order to exert influence in global governance. India's solidarity with these coalitions conditions the adaptability of its reform agenda and prohibits the pursuit of diplomatic initiatives that do not address the collective interests of the global South.

TI Reconciling RTAs with the WTO Multilateral Trading System: Case for a
   New Sunset Requirement on RTAs and Development Facilitation
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The proliferation of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in the recent decades demean's the future of the multilateral trading system (MTS) because the exclusive trade preferences of RTAs, although approved under the provisions of Article XXIV General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), are fundamentally inconsistent with a core principle of the MTS, the most favoured nation (MFN) principle, and causes discriminatory trade practices and fragmentations of trade disciplines. paper argues that an ultimate solution will be reconciling the terms of RTAs with the core principle of the MTS by requiring extension of exclusive RTA preferences to the entire World Trade Organization (WTO) membership on an MFN basis after a certain period of time. The article also attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution with an application of the game theory. The article also analyses the impact oldie proposed extension on the WTO system and discusses special and differential treatment (SDT) in favour of developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs), in the context of the proposed solution.

TI Are preferential trade agreements with non-trade objectives a stumbling
   block for multilateral liberalization?
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB In many preferential trade agreements (PTAs), countries exchange not only reductions in trade barriers but also cooperation in non-trade issues such as labour and environmental standards, intellectual property, etc. We provide a model of PTAs motivated by cooperation in non-trade issues and analyse its implications for global free trade and welfare. We find that such PTAs increase the cost of multilateral tariff reductions and thus cause a stumbling block to global free trade. This occurs because multilateral tariff reductions decrease the threat that can be used in PTAs and thus the surplus that can be extracted from them. By explicitly modelling the interaction between preferential and multilateral negotiations, we derive a testable prediction and provide novel econometric evidence that supports the model's key prediction. The welfare analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing this type of PTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus the model can predict the rules we observe. We also analyse alternative rules that constitute a Pareto improvement.

AB In the era of globalization, Multilateral Trade Liberalization and Regional Trading Arrangements (RTAs) have brought with them a significant erosion of border tariffs in international trade in recent years. Countries' borders are not enough for capital transfer and the markets play sufficient roles. If developing countries want to enter the global market, they must be able to comply with many export requirements such as standards and technical regulations usually referred to as Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). The term Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) refers to mandatory technical regulations and voluntary standards that define specific characteristics of a product (size, shape, design, labeling, marking, packaging, functionality or performance), as well as the associated "conformity assessment procedures" (e.g. testing, inspection and certification activities) (Athanasiadis,2012). The Africa-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) developing countries are in need of exporting their products in order to achieve economical growth of their society. For the attainment of these purposes, the implementation of National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) becomes necessary. The lack of national policy on quality infrastructure is perceived as a key shortcoming in some ACP countries. Moreover relevant economic operators do not always consider the importance of a reliable and advanced QI infrastructure as a key element in promoting trade and export. The main objective of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is to open markets through reductions in tariffs and elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). The barriers to trade are measures in place in markets, which make it difficult, or even impossible, for actual or potential foreign companies to enter or sell. The following measures are subject to TBT provisions: technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. It is largely agreed that technical regulations, standards and procedures for determining conformity can have both positive and detrimental effects on competition and international trade (OECD,2005) These measures ensure consumer safety; increase the transparency of product information and compatibility of products, etc. Furthermore, these requirements often increase transaction costs and are of greater concern to exporters and governments than any other type of non-tariff measure. The multilateral agreement on TBT seeks to ensure that technical regulations, standards and procedures for assessing conformity do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. It requires inter alia that applicable regulations are transparent, justifiable, non-discriminatory and based on international standards whenever possible. In our paper we present in short the World Trade Organizations' TBT Agreement and we describe the economic benefits linked to national quality infrastructure for developing countries. Also the necessary steps are given to follow for the implementation of an NQI in the developing ACP countries as well the implementation measures and challenges in ACP countries.

TI Patterns of Representation in WTO Committee Chairs, 1995-2012
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB This paper sets out to examine the pattern of WTO committee chair appointments by nationality since the WTO's founding in 1995. Chairs of the General Council (GC), subsidiary and negotiating committees play important roles in the outcome of trade negotiations and in administrative and implementation issues in Geneva. The GC selects most committee chairs, and must consider the balance of member representation and the quality of the candidates in its choices. Regression results indicate that the selection of a chair by nationality generally reflects the country's mission size in Geneva, the country's years of experience as a WTO member, and its economic interests in trade. The experience of individuals and continuity in committee leadership also appear to play important roles. Among developing countries, emerging markets (EMs) tend to have the largest proportional representation. The GC thus appears to follow a human capital model of chair selection, geographical constraints and especially development status balance considerations. Continued investments among all WTO members, but especially EM and other developing countries, in WTO representation and leadership capacity will be required in order to promote multilateral trade liberalization in the future.

TI Size inequality, coordination externalities and international trade
   agreements
SO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Developing countries now account for a significant fraction of world trade and two-thirds of the membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, many are still individually small and thus have a limited ability to bilaterally extract and enforce trade concessions from larger developed economies even though as a group they would be able to do so. We show that this coordination externality generates asymmetric outcomes under agreements that rely on bilateral threats of trade retaliation - such as the WTO - but not under agreements extended to include certain financial instruments. In particular, we find that an extended agreement generates improvements in global efficiency and equity if it includes the exchange of bonds prior to trading but not if it relies solely on ex post fines. Moreover, a combination of bonds and fines generates similar improvements even if small countries are subject to financial constraints that prevent them from posting bonds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Negotiations on WTO Special and Differential Clauses-EU Strategies and
   Impacts
SO EURAMERICA
AB Developing countries once had high expectations of the negotiations on Special and Differential (S&D) treatment under the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The achievements realized have turned out to be more limited than they had hoped. The European Union (EU), employing comprehensive and active strategies, has impacted S&D negotiations. The EU's overall negotiation strategy regarding S&D has been that of maximizing its interests under the WTO without challenging the WTO regime itself, particularly the regime's basic norms such as "development." Tactically, the EU has taken a step-by-step approach to consolidate its "ends/means" and "S&D differentiation" arguments, so that it can legitimately redefine and minimize its S&D obligations under the WTO regime. It seems that EU's strategic behavior on S&D has decelerated the progress of S&D negotiations under the DDA, and may establish a framework for future negotiations on related topics.

TI Does WTO Dispute Settlement Enforce or Inform?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Whereas some researchers emphasize how World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement reduces complexity and clarifies legislation, others argue that dispute rulings promote co-operation by providing an enforcement mechanism. This article identifies empirical implications from these distinct arguments and tests them on WTO disputes from 1995 to 2006. The study's analytical approach combines a three-step coding of dispute escalation with a strategic bargaining model and statistical backwards induction to account for governments' forward-looking behavior. It finds strong support for the argument that WTO dispute settlement primarily serves as an enforcement device. It finds much less support for the argument that dispute settlement reduces complexity and clarifies trade law. These results suggest that the role of WTO dispute settlement in generating information on acceptable trade policy standards is less relevant than proponents of the complexity argument tend to assume.

TI 'Friendly islands' in an unfriendly system: Examining the process of
   Tonga's WTO accession
SO ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
AB Tonga became the 151st member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in July 2007. This article considers the issues that Tonga faced during its WTO accession process, and the potential impact of the reforms it has made in compliance with the terms of its accession. It notes that WTO membership may offer some benefits to Tonga, including improved market access for its exports and the provision of technical assistance. The taxation and regulatory reforms necessitated by accession might also have some positive development effects. However, this article argues that the costs of WTO accession outweigh these benefits. This is because Tonga faced numerous challenges during its accession process, which led it to agree to substantial trade concessions. In addition, the 'special and differential' (S&D) treatment provisions intended to assist developing countries like Tonga once they become WTO members are inadequate. While this article focuses on Tonga, the issues raised are relevant to other Pacific SIDS engaged in WTO accession negotiations, including Vanuatu and Samoa.

TI The World Trade Organization's Doha Round and Cotton: Continued
   Peripheral Status or a "Historical Breakthrough" for African Farmers?
SO AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiators proclaimed that they had reached a "historical breakthrough" in late Summer 2004 as a framework was created to eliminate all export subsidies and reduce domestic subsidies and tariffs for agricultural commodities. While many hailed this step as a major victory for developing country farmers, others have been cautious on the potential "success" of the agreement. The main objective of this article is to provide an analysis of WTO agriculture negotiations, its main actors and alliances, and its legal content. Given the attention to West African cotton producers during the Doha round, this study focuses on producers of this crop in Mali. More specifically, this article: 1) evaluates progress made within the WTO in the aftermath of the Hong Kong Summit, including the workings of the Sub-Committee for Cotton; 2) analyzes potential short-and long-term effects on African cotton farmers (focusing on economic and ecological sustainability); and 3) proposes an alternative set of policies for improving the situation of African cotton farmers.

TI Developing Countries and Domestic Support Measures in Agriculture:
   Walking a Tightrope
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Supporting the domestic agriculture sector is a vital concern for most developing countries. Of late, developing countries' agricultural subsidies are increasingly falling under scrutiny at various WTO fora, including the Dispute Settlement Body and the Committee on Agriculture. The recent WTO panel ruling in China - Agricultural Producers and the multiple challenges against India's support measures on sugar and cane sugar are illustrations of this trend. It is a potential tinderbox and is bound to push the WTO dispute settlement system to another political crisis if these measures are seriously pursued. The fault lines of the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) are glaringly visible and the dubious economic basis for agriculture subsidy disciplines are likely to be vigorously contested. Maintaining essential agriculture support programme is a matter of life and death for several developing countries. In that context, the article is an attempt to formulate a few suggestions which can be helpful for the developing countries to design their agriculture policies in a manner that is consistent with the WTO legal framework and, in particular, the AoA. The article provides some practical suggestions for designing programmes which can take advantage of the limited flexibilities provided under the AoA for the calculation of Aggregate Measurement of Support and Market Price Support. On the whole, a carefully crafted agriculture subsidy policy can help the WTO Members to maintain essential public stockholding or other income or price support programmes.

In recent years, developing countries and international organisations alike have begun to explore the potentialities of global generic markets and competition generally, and also of using compulsory licensing to remedy anti-competitive practices (e.g. excessive pricing) through TRIPS-compatible antitrust enforcement.

Two of the main theoretical approaches, international constitutionalism and legal fragmentation, try to explain the changes that have taken place in the last twenty five years. In this context, the World Trade Organization (WTO) - and its "rule oriented" profile-has been analyzed by constitutionalist authors as an example of constitutionalization of the multilateral trading system. Legal fragmentation theorists have seen the multilateral trading system as a fragmented legal system, mostly due to the existence of preferential trade agreements. The objective of this paper is to analyze both trends (constitutionalization and fragmentation) within the multilateral trading system, taking into account the increasing participation of developing countries and the (current) lack of consensus that was crucial to the creation of the WTO.

TI Food Security Amendments to the WTO Green Box: A Critical Re-Examination
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB This article deals with one among the many significant issues with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture that brought trade negotiations during the Doha Round to a standstill; and it continuous to remain contentious. The genesis of the conflict lies in a proposal to amend the Agreement to exclude certain policies of price support, given by developing countries to answer their food security goals, from the disciplines of the Agreement. The issue has thrown into sharp relief the overall conflict between development oriented goals and trade liberalization within the WTO legal order. This article posits that the most significant opposition to the amendment pretends to be economic in content, while masking an obviously political nature. In order to unmask this, the article investigates some theoretical foundations of subsidy regulation in WTO law, and particularly attacks the concept of distortion which is frequently used to classify subsidies. This article aims to show that as a theoretical matter, the amendment to Agreement on Agriculture is not perniciously trade-distorting as has been projected, and that developing countries can stake legitimate claim to have such amendment passed. Finally, through such argument, the article aims to place the conflict between two normative ideals, trade liberalization and food security in proper perspective.

AB The purpose of the work is consideration and analysis of the effect of neoprotectionist activities existing in the international trade on growth and/or decrease in the international trade within the framework of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements; to what extent a particular non-tariff measure promotes or impedes international trade turnover. That is a very important and relevant issue for developing countries, including Georgia, the study of this issue should contribute to assessing risks and possibilities in commercial diplomacy. In the work, WTO's statistical data on tariff and non-tariff barriers is studied and its analytical review is presented. To what extent the trade liberalization measures taken within the framework of WTO contributed to increasing of neo-protectionism; whether they really promoted the expansion of international trade flows or not. The paper outlines the extent to which neo-protectionist measures would be important and useful for the development or promotion of local entrepreneurship; whether it is really better to apply them in comparison with tariff barriers. Non-tariff barriers are mainly applied by developed countries against developing ones, the reason for which is an aggravation of competition on the world market, and the country is striving for the protection of national producers' results from that. Oftentimes unilaterally introduced non-tariff regulation measures give rise to a whole chain of mutually restrictive actions. At the current stage, antidumping measures through increasing duties are the main legal import limitation instrument for WTO member countries. The number of antidumping investigations has been constantly increasing in the recent years. Transfer of non-tariff protectionism to the level of trade economic groupings appears as another trend of its development. Within the framework of numerous regional integration structures and inside bilateral trade agreements non tariff barriers are effectively applied both with respect to third countries and in member countries' mutual trade, and this takes place in conditions of significant liberalization of customs taxation. The conclusions made in the work deal with what should be taken into account by the countries in selecting a trade policy; how a concrete government should make a decision in the process of establishing of trade barriers and what measure it should opt for in a certain situation. It is a very important issue for the national governments of developing countries, especially from the viewpoint of protection of infant industries.

TI Dispute settlement in world politics: States, supranational prosecutors,
   and compliance
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB This article addresses one prominent expression of the interplay between politics and law in international cooperation: the dynamics of bargaining in the settling of compliance disputes. Our central argument is that the formal structure of dispute settlement systematically shapes the likelihood and terms of negotiated compliance settlements. We introduce an ideal type distinction between interstate dispute settlement, where the authority to sue states for non-compliance resides exclusively with states, and supranational dispute settlement, where this authority is partly or entirely delegated to a commission or secretariat with a prosecutorial function. We hypothesize that systems relying on supranational prosecution are more effective in addressing non-compliance, and more likely to mediate the impact of power asymmetries on dispute settlement outcomes, compared to systems relying on state-initiated complaints only. We find support for this proposition in an in-depth comparison of dispute settlement and compliance bargaining in the World Trade Organization and the European Union, and in a brief survey of experiences from other international organizations.

TI Agricultural trade reform under the Doha Agenda: some key issues
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB A successful agreement on agriculture is essential for an overall agreement under the WTO's Doha trade negotiations. Reaching agreement has been difficult, and as of August 2007, much still remains to be done if a successful agreement is to be reached. We consider three of the most controversial areas of the agricultural negotiations: the relative importance of domestic support, market access and export subsidies; three market access issues of sensitive-product exceptions sought for all countries and, the additional special product exceptions sought for developing countries, the proposed special safeguard mechanism; and the domestic support issue. We show that decisions made on reform in these areas will have a critical influence on whether the negotiations achieve their objectives of promoting trade reform and reducing poverty.

TI Duration of membership in the world trade organization and
   investment-oriented remittances inflows
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This article examines the effect of the duration of the membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on investment-oriented remittances inflows (i.e., the portion of total remittances invested by remittancereceiving households in business activities). The analysis covers 120 countries over the period from 1996 to 2019, and employs the two-step system generalized method of moments estimator. It provides support for the hypothesis that by improving the stability and predictability of the business environment (i.e., by reducing tariffs volatility, trade uncertainty and economic uncertainty), the WTO membership provides strong incentives for remittance-receiving households to invest a fraction of their total remittances in business activities. This positive effect of the membership duration on investment-oriented remittances inflows appears to stronger for less developed countries. Additionally, longstanding WTO Members enjoy higher investment-oriented remittances inflows when they have large populations (a proxy for larger amounts of total remittances inflows), experience high trade volumes, a higher economic growth performance, and receive higher development aid inflows. Incidentally, the duration of WTO membership is positively and significantly associated with total remittances inflows. These findings complement previous works that highlighted the relevance of the WTO in promoting the development of the private sector in its member states (including developing members and the poorest among them).(c) 2023 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

TI Making FDI More Sustainable: Towards an Indicative List of FDI
   Sustainability Characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT & TRADE
AB Reaching the Sustainable Development Goals has become the lodestar of development policymaking. Increased sustainable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to developing countries can contribute to reaching the Goals. This article analyzes 150 instruments (treaties, standards, codes) prepared by key stakeholder groups in the FDI space bearing on the relationship between host countries and foreign investors, to identify FDI sustainability characteristics along the following four dimensions: economic, social and environmental development and governance. These instruments indicate especially the contributions government expect multinational enterprises (MNEs) to make to host countries and those MNEs expect to make to host countries. The analysis yields a set of indicative 'common FDI sustainability characteristics', and 'emerging common FDI sustainability characteristics'. These characteristics can guide various stakeholder groups that seek to increase the contribution of FDI to development; the World Trade Organization's Structured Discussions concerning an investment facilitation framework for development; and to arbitrators seeking to take the development dimension into account when deliberating investor-state disputes.

TI Participation of Developing Countries in the WTO - New Evidence Based on

SO WTO LAW AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB The WTO takes pride in being a "Member-driven" organization, with decisions taken by consensus among all Member states. But how active are the various Member states in reality? In particular, to what extent do developing countries participate in the proceedings - and if not, why not? This chapter offers new evidence on this subject based of WTO official records for 2003. Data show that the activity level is highly uneven and is correlated closely with size and income levels. The relative silence of smaller and poorer member states is especially telling at the technical level ( Committees and Working Groups) where the substantive work is carried out.

TI International trade and food security: conceptual discussion, WTO and

SO CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the concept and measurements of food security under the framework of The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, explores the link between international trade and food security with an empirical investigation into the case of China, and draw policy implications in the context of WTO.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper elaborates the theoretical interconnection between food security and international trade and then utilize an autoregressive distributed lag model to investigate how/whether trade affects food security in China from two dimensions.
   Findings - The authors find that international trade indeed leads China to increase its dependence on food imports, namely, it negatively affects the food security in China. Owing to the importance of food security under multilateral trade system, this paper then briefly analyzes two relevant topics of Doha Round negotiation, i.e. public stockholding for food security and special safeguard measures. It is proposed that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access.
   Originality/value - This paper discusses the interaction of international trade and food security in various aspects. Empirical study shows that increasing dependence on food imports will negatively impact the food security of China. It is concluded that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Developing countries assert that the limited size of their markets renders conventional trade retaliatory actions by them ineffective. The complaint is that they have no effective mechanism for forcing developed countries into compliance with WTO obligations that have market access consequences for developing countries. This paper proposes a design for the use of TRIPS as a retaliatory weapon in WTO trade disputes that would overcome some of these difficulties. The proposal has many advantages: it is feasible, effective, legal, and has certain attractive attributes that are absent in conventional trade retaliation. The very presence of the threat of such retaliatory action in domestic intellectual property legislation could lead to improved compliance by developed countries.

AB Multilateral negotiations on agriculture in the WTO are making very little progress as developed economies are reluctant to bind trade-distorting domestic support and import tariffs at levels acceptable to developing countries. This paper presents the basic Bagwell-Staiger framework as it relates to agricultural trade negotiations. In its basic version, market access commitments are sufficient to achieve efficient trade agreements. We show that vertical linkages between agricultural goods and processed food commodities may prevent countries to reach an efficient trade agreement. We argue that the features of agricultural supply chains hinder the argument that total discretion over domestic policies is appropriate.

TI Competition makes IT better: Evidence on when firms use IT more

SO RESEARCH POLICY
AB We study how technology upgrading through investment in information and communication technologies (IT henceforth) influences firm performance in the context of a developing country. We rely on a novel firm-level data set covering a large sample of Mexican manufacturing companies with detailed information on IT. We show that the impact of IT investment is only positive for firms that were exposed to an exogenous competitive shock due to the increase in competition from China after its WTO accession. We argue that incentives provided by competition are key in leading firms to make more effective use of the new information technologies. We also find evidence that these results are driven by the complementarity between IT investments and organizational or process changes within firms, specifically under the incentives of heightened international competitive pressures.

TI China and the Doha Development Agenda
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB In contrast to early predictions during its accession, China has not sought to play a leadership role in the Doha Round negotiations or to rewrite WTO rules in a systemic manner. However, China's role in the negotiations came into prominence during the 'mini-ministerial' held in Geneva in July 2008. Now included in the seven-member group (G-7), China came under fire from the United States and the European Union for failing to demonstrate greater leadership. This article seeks to explain the nature of that criticism and argues that over-reliance on the question of 'Chinese leadership' as an explanatory concept could aggravate broader misperceptions about China's position in the Doha Round. According to these misperceptions, China has 'broken cover' and that it has become more 'assertive' while becoming more 'protectionist'. In other words, there is the view today that China has emerged as a fresh obstacle to the conclusion of the Doha Round talks. This article analyses that misreading and argues that an analysis of China's position in the negotiations must be tempered by a more nuanced understanding of certain tensions and mixed positions within China's overall approach. The article seeks to explain China's current position in the goods negotiations, on agriculture and non-agricultural market access, and in the services and rules negotiations. It also tries to explain the complexities of China's alignment with developing country members and how that is likely to translate into various negotiating positions on specific issues. Finally, the article discusses a range of factors that are likely to play an important, continuing role in shaping China's perception of specific trade issues and, more importantly, its perception of the overall worth of an eventual outcome to the Doha Round. These range from China's reflections on the success of the 2001 accession process, its domestic political constraints, the emergence of a successful FTA programme, and resort to out-of-WTO aid for developing country nations, as well as the potential longer term impact of the current global economic crisis.

SO CONTEMPORARY POLITICS
AB In this article, the challenges posed to the European Union's (EU) role in trade policy and its implications for development policy during the World Trade Organization's Doha Development Agenda, also known as the Doha round, are highlighted. The authors argue that transformed power relations have created a situation characterized by role uncertainty, for the emerging powers but also for the EU. Priorities among multiple possible roles - in the existing trade regime, in relation to the global South and in the ongoing negotiations - become subject to redefinition. For the EU, heavily wedded to a multilateralist and reformist mission because of its own history, this process is particularly difficult. The EU's traditional role conceptions as a leader and a benign partner to developing countries have been challenged and partly replaced by a more realist approach.

TI Outward FDI from Canada and Its Policy Context
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB Canada was a major net importer of foreign direct investment (IFDI) prior to 1996. The stimulus for the surge in Canada's outward FDI (OFDI) came from profitable investment opportunities abroad. Canada has significantly diversified its OFDI away from the United States over the past 20 years. The financial crisis significantly affected Canada's FDI outflows, but OFDI seems to have rebounded in the second half of 2009. While Canadian investment has historically gone mainly to developed countries, recent changes in government policies seem to suggest that Canada is looking to build closer ties with developing countries as well. Canada has a longstanding commitment to multilateral cooperation and actively supports the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework as a way to promote international trade and investment. At the same time, Canada continues actively to negotiate foreign investment promotion and protection agreements (FIPAs).

TI The enlargement of market access in the WTO negotiations: What is the
   impact of tariff cutting formulas?
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
AB This article investigates the effect of different tariff cutting options discussed in the recent WTO-Round. Thereby the article focuses on the improved access to the EU market and whether industrialized countries, developing countries, least developed countries (LDCs) or the non-WTO member countries are able to take advantage of the enlarged EU market access. Using an extended GTAP model with bound and applied tariff rates, we conduct 10 experiments that differ in the magnitudes of tariff cuts, the tariff cutting formula, the implementation of a maximum tariff and in the numbers and width of tariff bands. The results reveal that the EU-27 experiences a relative increase of imports for beef, milk, sugar and cereals which is with varying degrees driven by the magnitude of tariff cuts, the kind of formula and the elimination of export subsidies. In contrast, numbers and width of bands as well as capping does not play a significant role. The LDCs are not obliged to reduce any of their tariffs in the current WTO-negotiation. Regarding these LDCs and the nonWTO member countries it therefore does not make much of a difference whether tariff cuts are high or implemented with different formulas, numbers and width of tariff bands. They only realize a minor trade gain. In contrast, other developing countries are able to disproportionately increase their beef, sugar and cereal exports to the EU, if higher tariff cuts are implemented. Other tariff cutting options do not lead to a significant higher access of developing countries to the EU market.

TI Risk management in border inspection
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB As part of their commitments under the WTO's Agreement on Trade Facilitation, many developing countries will adopt risk management, a strategy for selecting import shipments for inspection. In this paper we formalize key enforcement issues related to risk management. We argue that the complexities of international trade oversight mean that inspecting agencies lack certainty about the conditional probability that a given shipment will comply with import regulations. Ambiguity of this sort is likely to be important in developing countries that lack the sophisticated information technology (IT) used in advanced risk management. We show empirically that infrequent shipments have conditionally higher inspection rates, a finding that is consistent with our ambiguity hypothesis. We formalize a role for ambiguity in a theoretical model of border inspection. We calibrate the model and shock the ambiguity parameters to illustrate the consequences of an IT-driven improvement in risk management capabilities for search and compliance.

In this article we suggest a more positive interpretation of India's role through a close analysis of its diplomacy during the 2001 Doha Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The Indian delegation attempted proactively to shape the agenda of the negotiations and to promote a form of developmental multilateralism that might correct the perceived imbalances within the substantive commitments to and structure and processes of the WTO. India failed to get its way at the time, but the ongoing deadlock at Doha demonstrates the continuing salience of such alternative conceptions of global justice.

AB 21st century is the era dominated by knowledge-based economy. The world economic competition has already transformed from the material resources to human resources development, thus, human resources development, utilization and management will be the key points to socio-economic development constraints. The enterprises have to engage in human resources developments which want to take an invincible position in such a competitive environment. Especially for developing countries, they should use human resource accounting for gathering substantial human resources information in conditions of scarce resources to development. Joined the World Trade Organization, our country has become increasingly frequent international exchanges and cooperation, which must have an effectively controlling of human resources and research in which our country can occupy a favorable position in international competition. The most important issue to human resource accounting is the measurement of the value of human resources. For this point, establishing the value of measuring human resources theory and econometric models, the appropriate response and measurement of the value of human resources are important for practical significance and theoretical basis.

TI Africa in the first decade of WTO dispute settlement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB African countries have largely been absent as players at the WrO dispute settlement system in its first decade. In recent literature, this has been attributed to a number of factors, among them, the low volume of trade with an export base often characterized by single unprocessed commodities, a complicated and expensive dispute settlement system, inadequate legal expertise and a less litigious approach to possible disputes particularly when major trading and donor partners are involved. By showing how and to what extent African countries have participated in GATT and WTO disputes, as well as in the DSU review negotiations and other related processes, the present article argues that this weak participation by large sections of the WTO membership is a danger to the long-term "predictability" function of the WTO, and could undermine the usefulness of the entire process eventually. It closes with various proposals on how the problem may be addressed.

SO AUSTRALASIAN REVIEW OF AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Concerns have been expressed about the impact of free trade on many developing countries and whether such countries really stand to benefit from the current regimes for the global governance of trade. This is particularly exemplified by the challenges African nations confront in gaining export access for their products in the global North and the inability of the WTO Doha Development Round to resolve the matter effectively. Africa remains the world's poorest continent. In addressing challenges confronting Africa in the global governance of trade, we examine the existing framework for trade liberalisation in the continent against the backdrop of the regional trade arrangements and the recent efforts towards the formation of an African Continental Free Trade Area. The paper discusses some of the challenges of Africa in the WTO system especially in relation to the ability to compete favourably in global markets and how the continent may pursue trade liberalisation objectives in a manner conducive to the realisation of the development goals of the continent through regional integration.

The purpose of the amendments is to make it possible for developing countries to have access to generic medicines at a lower cost.

They then illustrate the manner in which the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) constitutes an intensification of the international system for protecting industrial ownership, then they finally dwell upon righteousness of the solution adopted at Doha, then by Canada.

TI Trade Conflicts:Whither the WTO?
SO LEGAL ISSUES OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB The WTO is in a state of crisis. Yet its problems did not start with the Trump Administration. And although this has been the focus of much criticism from the United States, the Appellate Body should not be the priority in reforming the WTO. More differentiation amongst its members and its rules is needed, to reflect varying levels of development. In addition, more room for plurilaterals ought to be created. China's atypical economic model ought to be reconciled with the WTO's market-orientation. This can be done through an update of its Protocol of Accession to the WTO, or perhaps through a newly conceived plurilateral agreement. Such a bridging mechanism would reflect a renewed engagement of China with the WTO, and could help to recommit the United States to a rules-based system. The EU should take initiatives to make this happen.

TI A Critical Appraisal of WTO Negotiations to Establish a Multilateral
   Register for Geographical Indications
SO REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS REGIONALES
AB To what degree should geographical indications (GIs) be protected by international law? What is the best way to protect at international level the names of well-known products, such as Rioja wine, which have a great reputation around the world? Do current international rules provide sufficient safeguards, or should governments implement another system of more effective protection? These are the questions that need to be solved by WTO Members within the scope of the Built-In Agenda of the TRIPS Agreement. It is true that TRIPS provisions undoubtedly represent a considerable improvement in the international protection of GIs with respect to that which existed under WIPO. However, this Agreement did not create a complete international protection system. Quite the contrary, these provisions continue generating considerable legal uncertainty. For these reasons, negotiations between the new and the old world must continue in order to solve outstanding issues with respect to GIs. In particular, the twin negotiating issues of the multilateral register and the additional protection for products other than wines and spirits. However, WTO Members remain divided over the nature, reach, effects and scope of this registration system. In the present author's view, the minimalist approach defended by some of WTO Members presents the great disadvantage of limiting itself to creating a simple database without consistent legal effects. This approach is not of a multilateral character and hardly will help to facilitate GIs protection. By contrast, the consensualist approach defended by the European Union as part of a coalition of 108 WTO Members, which includes a huge number of developing countries, could truly contribute to facilitate multilateral protection as Article 23.4 TRIPS Agreement prescribes. Interestingly enough, it is apparent from recent debates that developing countries are becoming aware of the importance of GIs as instruments that contribute to the development of their economies. Therefore, the pressure exerted by these countries could bring an end to the deadlock that had continued for so many years. Otherwise, resistance to this negotiation may communicate an unfortunate message to these countries about the reality of WTO international intellectual property rights regime.

TI Food security though public stockholdings and trade distortions
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB Purpose The issue of subsidized acquisition of food stocks for food security purposes has become a contentious issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO) due to their potential impact on international trade. The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the effects on trade of stockholding programs designed specifically to meet a food security objective.
   Design/methodology/approach A spatial-temporal trade model is developed and then the effects of stockholding policies which satisfy food security goals are simulated and compared to the case where stockholdings are not allowed.
   Findings The results suggest that if stockholding policies that satisfy food security goals are allowed in the case of all importing countries and all G-33 developing countries trade will increase significantly during the stock acquisition phase but will have a negative impact on trade during stock disposal. If stockholding policies are restricted to small high food security risk countries, however, the impacts on trade would not be large enough to be of international concern.
   Originality/value The results suggests that a permanent solution at the WTO might lie in exemptions for small high food security risk countries rather than a one size fits all rule applied to all developing countries. Trade policy makers have been charged with finding a permanent solution to the issue of subsidized public stockholdings for food security purposes but have been hampered, in part, by a dearth of empirical estimates of the effect of such stockholdings on trade. This paper informs the negotiations.

CT 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC)
CY DEC 10-13, 2017
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
SP WTO
AB With the growing importance of the internet, digital trade, or electronic commerce, has become a key issue in international trade regulation. As the home to some of the largest internet companies in the world, the USA took the lead in bringing the issue into the WTO and has been the leading proponent on the issue. In contrast, the developing countries were quite sceptical and reluctant to engage on discussions on the issue. Recently, however, several developing countries have changed their positions and become more active participants. Chief among them is China, which has raised some interesting proposals both within and beyond the WTO. The issue also emerged as one of the main issues discussed at the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO. This article provides a critical examination of the contrasting approaches of the US and China on the issue. It argues that, the US approach tends to focus more on the 'digital' nature of digital trade, while the Chinese approach prefers to address the issue from the traditional 'trade' perspective. The article analyses the reasons for the different approaches, and provides some suggestions on how to move forward on the issue at MC11 and beyond given the differences between the two approaches.

TI China-US trade War: an Indonesian perspective
SO CHINA ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB This paper takes a wholistic approach to the effect of US-China trade war on Indonesia. The paper starts by laying out the context of the rise of protectionism and nationalism, comparing developed and developing country context, and its various causes such as unequal distribution of benefits and responses to the rise of China. The new US approach fousing on goods trade deficit, targeting mainly China but also other countries, including Indonesia and it should be seen as a tool to address the real concerns of the US regarding unfair trade, such as technology transfer, industrial subsidies and trade and investment distortions. It also reflects the US view of the inadequcy of the WTO. In terms of direct impact, the US-China trade war is creating uncertainties to global growth and in particular any decline in China's growth is likely to hit Indonesia and other ASEAN countries given that China has become their number one trading partner. As for pbenefit from trade diversion and investment relocation to avoid the trade war, given the structure of its exports and lack of integration in the Global Value Chians, Indonesia is unlikley to benefit compared to several other Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam. However, any net benefit from this, will far outweigh the cost of the uncertainty in the rules based multilateral trading system (MTS) and the retreat of the US leadership to safeguard the MTS. The paper looks at how the current US unilateralism is framed in a carrot and stick approach, which does not benefit developing countries like Indonesia. To fill the leadership vacuum to maintain an open rules based order, other countries need to take the leadership position. This can be done by pursuing their own unilateral agenda of structural reforms, increasing regional economic integration and take collective leadership to conduct necessary reforms of the WTO especially on issues that are at the heart of the US-China trade war such as industrial subsidies, strengthening IPR, investment issues related to technology transfer, and competition policy and the level playing field.

TI The EU and the new trade politics
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
AB Over the past twenty years trade politics within the European Union ( EU) have changed in three ways. First, the concerns of traditional trade actors have shifted to more `behind-the-border' issues, especially regulation and investment. Second, new actors - parliaments, non-trade agencies, and non-governmental organizations - have become more engaged. Third, the leadership of the EU (and the United States) has been challenged by influential developing countries. The EU has responded to the new trade politics by advocating a ` deep' trade agenda: seeking multilateral agreements on the making of domestic rules. This response reflects the EU's own experience of market integration. Where the new trade politics have affected EU policy it has been through changing views about the purposes and priority of trade policy at the highest political levels, rather than more directly via interest group lobbying. While the EU has been unsuccessful in promoting its agenda within the World Trade Organization, it is pursuing it through other forums where its influence is greater.

TI Climate change and gene patents
SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Climate change is imposing significant stresses upon agriculture at a time when more food is required for an increasing world population. Genetic engineering is mooted as a technological response to these difficulties. The modification of the DNA of major crop groups produces plants which are more resistant to drought, salinity and to pests. The patenting of climate-useful DNA provides an opportunity to protect the investment in the exploitation of this DNA. The international IPR regime based upon the WTO TRIPS Agreement enables the patenting of this DNA across the globe. As a matter of practice, this patenting is confined to a relatively small group of life-sciences companies. This market concentration has important agricultural policy implications, particularly for developing countries. This article analyses these issues, concluding that the impact of patenting upon food security is becoming as significant as the impact of patenting upon access to medicines.

TI EU FTA negotiations with SADC and Mercosur: integration into the world
   economy or market access for EU firms?
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB The EU claims that its free trade agreements with regional organisations of developing countries can promote the respective regions' integration into the world economy. Taking as case studies EU negotiations with the Southern African Development Community and Mercosur, the paper argues that the EU and its partners have different conceptions of integration into the world economy. For the EU the latter simply means multilateral trade liberalisation under the wto, while, for its partners, it involves increasing industrial production and exports of manufactured products. If the latter notion is accepted, an fta with the EU should increase European foreign direct investment into the region or at least increase their trade surpluses, thus increasing the resources available for support of local firms. The paper argues that an fta with the EU will not be likely to produce these results; thus the fta will simply be an instrument to promote market access for EU firms.

TI Low-income developing countries and WTO litigation: Why wake up the

SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most judicialized dispute settlement systems in international politics. While a general appreciation has developed that the system has worked quite well, research has not paid sufficient attention to the weakest actors in the system. This paper addresses the puzzle of missing cases of least-developed countries initiating WTO dispute settlement procedures. It challenges the existing literature on developing countries in WTO dispute settlement which predominantly focuses on legal capacity and economic interests. The paper provides an argument that the small universe of 'actionable cases', the option of free riding and the assessment of the perceived opportunity costs related to other foreign policy priorities better explain the absence of cases. In addition (and somewhat counterintuitively), we argue that the absence of cases is not necessarily bad news and shows how the weakest actors can use the dispute settlement system in a 'lighter version' or in indirect ways. The argument is empirically assessed by conducting a case study on four West African cotton-producing countries (C4) and their involvement in dispute settlement.

TI Australian trade policy in an age of globalisation
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Arguably, the world trading system has entered a period of greater change and uncertainty in the past two years than at any time since the end of the Cold War. At the same time, Australia faces a range of internal and external challenges to its trade policy, while having lost many of the old 'certainties' guiding its trade agenda. This article identifies four major challenges confronting Australian trade policy now and into the future: the EU agenda to inject self-serving 'governance' mechanisms into the WTO; rises in the demands and influence of developing countries within the WTO; the new trend towards bilateral free trade areas; and increasing opposition to globalisation by groups within society. It assesses the capacity of Australia's trade bureaucracy to manage these issues, warning against expecting too much of the trade policy agenda, particularly in relation to the role it plays within domestic politics in Australia.

   to India
SO MARGIN-JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB The Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) is intended to provide contingent protection to poor farmers in developing countries from negative shocks to import prices or from surges in imports. The effects of stochastic import prices and volumes are analysed in a partial equilibrium framework to illustrate the issues involved. The simplicity of the mechanisms for contingent protection illustrated through geometry are contrasted with the modalities that were proposed in July 2008. These are the choice between an import price trigger or an import quantity trigger. The triggers have been incorporated into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model by Hertel et al. (2010) and stochastic simulations conducted in order to compare their effects on the levels and volatility of key variables. The conclusion is that the quantity trigger is less effective in achieving the principal objective of the SSM.

TI EU Economic Partnership Agreements and WTO negotiations. A quantitative
   assessment of trade preference granting and erosion in the banana market
SO FOOD POLICY
AB The paper provides a quantitative assessment of the impact on the banana market of the expansion of trade preferences the European Union granted Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries with the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) and of the possible erosion of these preferences as a result of different possible conclusions, if any, of on-going WTO negotiations. The results of the simulations performed suggest that the impact of the EPA on production and consumption of bananas in the EU will be limited, while benefits for ACP countries will be significant (at the expense of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) exporters). An agreement between the EU and MFN countries to end the outstanding WTO disputes on bananas and/or the conclusion of the WTO Doha round may bring an erosion of the preferential margins currently enjoyed by ACP countries of such an order of magnitude as to cancel out most of these benefits.

TI Regulating Cross-Border Data Flows in a Data-Driven World: How WTO Law
   Can Contribute
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB While the free cross-border movement of data is essential to many aspects of international trade, several countries have imposed restrictions on these data flows. The pre-internet rules of the World Trade Organization ('WTO') discipline some of these restrictions, but they are insufficient. Unfortunately, so are the electronic commerce chapters in modern preferential trade agreements. This article argues that reformed WTO rules, which take account of the policy challenges of the data-driven economy, are required. These reforms would facilitate internet openness while ensuring consumer and business trust, promoting digital inclusion of developing countries, and incorporating clear exceptions for legitimate domestic policies.

TI Nepal at the crossroads of copyright regime
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB Copyright in Nepal is a recent phenomenon with a very short history behind it. With its membership of WTO in September 2003, Nepal came into the fold of the international copyright system as envisaged by the TRIPS Agreement. However, implementing the TRIPS Agreement is itself a challenging task to a developing country like Nepal, given its poor human and capital resources. But what is still more challenging, and perhaps more important to the Nepalese economy, is the capability of development needed to absorb the balance-of-payment impact that TRIPS implementation will bring with it on the crucial sector of knowledge trade, particularly in the publishing sector.
   This article is arranged in five sections. First, it briefly outlines the development of copyright in Nepal. Second, it provides an overview of the key features of the new Copyright Act, 2002. Third, it illustrates how the need for copyright compliance arises as the market for indigenous cultural products picks up. Fourth, it examines some of the key arguments put forward as the advantages for developing countries of joining the international convention. Finally, the article concludes that until the indigenous copyright industry, especially the publishing sector, grows competitive, the copyright balance sheet of Nepal will remain largely overshadowed by the import bill for foreign publications.

   SANYAL
SE India Studies in Business and Economics
AB In an era when free trade has been championed by neoliberal policies across the world, there is surprisingly high usage of trade-restricting measures adopted by developed and developing countries. While dissatisfaction with the neoliberal doctrine of free trade is the most important reason behind these policies, it also symbolizes a return of nation-states against the forces of globalization. Policymaking in international trade can be tricky as several trade policy instruments can have very different impact on different domestic stakeholder groups. This chapter discusses these challenges using a study of the usage of trade policy instruments by India. In the last few years, India is seen to be using a number of policies aimed toward managing trade more effectively. The two sets of instruments which have been used frequently are the 'Minimum Import Prices' (MIP) and trade remedial measures like antidumping duties. This chapter will focus on these two sets of trade policy instruments to analyze the rationale behind their use. Recent controversies around these instruments suggest that while they give protection to some domestic stakeholders, other domestic players in the value chains may get adversely affected by these policies. This leads to some inter- and intra-sectoral trade-offs. This discussion will lead to a broader debate about the neoliberal policies propagated by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and their conflict with policy space available to developing countries for managing trade policies to suit their national objectives.

SO FOOD POLICY
AB The policies of wealthy countries have proven the most difficult to reform in the WTO Doha Round negotiations. Considerable emphasis has been placed on developing country impacts, but a gap in the literature remains on the stakes for rich country farmers despite the large role these countries play in global agricultural protection. The research here considers the particular case of US rice households and their sensitivity to Japanese market access reform. Using an applied general equilibrium model with multiple farm households we highlight the distributional impacts among these producers. We argue that concessions to Japan on market access make domestic reforms in rice a difficult political sale in the US since the wealthiest producers bear the largest losses. Improving our understanding of the distributional impacts and political realities of the richest countries is critical to informing the negotiating process because the gains to the world's poor can only be realized with creative policy redress in these rich nations.

TI Doha Reform of WTO Export Credit Provisions in the SCM Agreement: The

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Export credit instruments are important tools for enterprises used by developing and developed countries to face risks of default of transactions and to offer purchasers extended payment of their goods. Although they contribute to foster international trade, their misuse is likely to distort competition in the marketplace. In order to prevent competition being based on the amount of support received by the domestic Export Credit Agencies more than on price and quality of goods traded, states developed international rules within the framework of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and World Trade Organization (WTO). However, the manner in which those rules have been written creates an unbalanced playing field between developing and developed countries. During the Doha Development Round, some countries proposed amendments in the current WTO norms in order to modify items (j) and (k) of the Illustrative List of Annex I of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement and reduce die unbalances due to the financial and risk conditions of developing countries against developed countries. This contribution will analyse the interests of developing and developed countries in the Doha proposed reforms aimed at restoring a level playing field among WTO Members.

SO GEOFORUM
AB This review offers a critical reading of the November 2014 India-U.S. trade deal that unblocked an impasse in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha round and considers what it means for the way we govern global trade. It argues that the agreement, rather than being a 'victory' for the developing world or a cause for celebration, may simply reinforce an unfair and problematic system of distributing trade opportunities among WTO members. It may also obscure further the need for a fundamental overhaul of the way global trade is governed. In so doing, the review speaks to broader debates about what happens when 'rising' powers replace established states in global institutions in the absence of wider processes of reform; and it adds to growing concerns about the increasing precariousness of least developed countries (LDCs) in international economic regimes.

TI Reassessing The Trade-Development Nexus In International Economic Law:
   The Paradigm Shift In Asia-Pacific Regionalism
SO NORTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW & BUSINESS
AB This article reassesses the trade-development nexus in international economic law and provides the first examination of the approach to realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through regional integration. It argues that the emerging New Regional Economic Order in the multipolar system will fortify the coalition of developing countries in structuring the legalization of pro-development trade policy. For decades, the misconceived concept of special and differential treatment has ignored the reality of the North-South Grand Bargain and disconnected the World Trade Organization from its development objectives. The development crisis of the Doha Round requires a feasible "Plan B" for the Global South.
   By making interrelated theoretical and substantive claims, this article opens an inquiry into the assertive role of developing countries that prompted the paradigm shift in Asia-Pacific regionalism. The realist and dependency theories are utilized to decipher the geopolitical complexity of the rapidly evolving South-South free trade agreements. As a timely case study, the analysis is based on the creation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community and its implications for economic powers such as the United States and China. It provides an account of the bloc's services trade-oriented development policy under the balance of power strategy. Finally, this article offers regulatory reform proposals on how to integrate development assistance and remove trade barriers. Transnational legal harmonization and human rights protection in line with international labor principles are also indispensable. Such reforms will strengthen the best practices for global regionalism and reinvigorate the trade-development connection in the multilateral trading system.

TI THE ACCOUNTABILITY CHALLENGE TO GLOBAL E-COMMERCE: THE NEED TO OVERCOME
   THE DEVELOPED-DEVELOPING COUNTRY DIVIDE IN WTO E-COMMERCE POLICIES
SO PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES TO BALANCE ETHICAL, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   CONCERNS WITH CORPORATE REQUIREMENTS
SE Advances in Sustainability and Environmental Justice
AB Purpose - Because businesses conducting e-commerce are often able to set up off-shore to avoid regulation, taxation, and other aspects of corporate responsibility, the developed-developing divide which tends to inform World Trade Organization (WTO) policies is especially an impediment to future global e-commerce. This chapter explores the particular accountability challenges represented by WTO e-commerce policies.
   Design/methodology/approach - The framework of inquiry focuses on a policy research study of relevant WTO e-commerce policy documents, especially the ones related to the negotiations under the WTO Work Program on Electronic Commerce and the GATS Agreement.
   Findings - The virtual nature of e-commerce interactions means that businesses are often able to circumvent the national boundaries and controls of conventional commerce. Because of this, the WTO and its e-commerce policy are crucial to the responsible and accountable development of future global e-commerce. Such policies need to be significantly improved as a matter of urgency to overcome current omissions and inadequacies.
   Research implications - Accountability gaps within WTO's e-commerce policies provide a basis for companies from developed countries to set up off-shore to avoid their corporate social responsibilities. A constructive critique of international agency policy documents is able to provide a basis for recommending change and improvement to the overall WTO framework.
   Practical and social implications - Companies should profess genuine rather than merely surface commitment to global as well as local corporate social responsibilities. Likewise the WTO should also aim to practice deep rather than "shallow'' accountability by aiming to rectify omissions and inequities in its e-commerce policies.

TI The Necessity to Balance the Barcelona Process : Economic Integration
   between North Africa and the European Union
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB The Barcelona process is an ongoing process and its first economic results are still insignificant. This study had two objectives. The first is to provide a global assessment of its impacts on the three North African countries that have already became members of this process, namely Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt. The second objective is to explore its potentials by a larger inclusion of agriculture in the Euromed partnership. The approach adopted in this paper is the use of the MIRAGE global Computable General equilibrium Model and the MacMAPS database that gives a very detailed picture of the bilateral protection between all the WTO members. This approach allowed us to consider all the economic interactions that exist between the North African countries and the European Union as well as the economic interaction between the North African countries themselves. In addition a special emphasis was given to the compute methods used to aggregate tariffs. Indeed, existing methods of aggregation are underestimating the level of tariffs applied by the European Union on agricultural products. This underestimation induces an underestimation of the effects of agriculture liberalization on North African economies. In this paper, we develop an original method of aggregation that attempts to deal with this problem and that gives a more accurate approximation of the market access barriers applied by the European countries. Our main contribution in this article is to develop an original approach of aggregation that aims to obtain a more realistic estimation of the tariffs faced by developing countries and by consequence to obtain a more realistic estimation of the economic impacts of agricultural liberalization between developed and developing countries.

TI Tariffs of the World: Are Customs Duties Really Growing Unimportant?
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Some scientists and authorities are arguing that tariffs are growing more and more unimportant since eight GATT/WTO-Tariff-Rounds have resulted in tremendous reductions of the original tariff rates in the late 1940ies. The Non-Tariff-Measures however are gaining more importance.
   A WCO-background-paper has been published in September 2008 which shows the amount of revenue of a state that is generated by customs duties. The results are amazing. Tariffs are not important any more for developed states however revenue from customs duties is of very much importance to the (least) developing countries. The WCO-background-paper is based on data of 142 countries, territories and economic unions (all referred to as 'countries').

TI Asymmetric bargaining and development trade-offs in the
   CARIFORUM-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB On 15 October 2008, CARIFORUM became the first region among the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries to sign a 'full' Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU). Although the EPA process has generated widespread critical commentary, few analysts have stopped to consider the motives of individual ACP countries and regions in their approach to the talks. In this article we consider the question of motives in relation to the CARIFORUM-EU EPA. Specifically, it asks why did CARIFORUM feel it necessary or desirable to sign a 'full' EPA, containing numerous provisions not actually mandated by the WTO, when the rest of the ACP was content to sign far less ambitious 'goods only' interim agreements? In order to address this question, the article goes beyond the extant EU-ACP trade literature to build on wider international political economy (IPE) scholarship, which has analysed the actions of developing countries in relation to a whole range of 'WTO-plus' North-South regional and bilateral FTAs. On this basis, the article stands back from the complex details of the agreement to analyse its wider significance, especially in terms of the presumed trade-off between the immediate economic benefits of improved and more secure market access, against the longer term costs of sacrificing the regulatory autonomy, or policy space, deemed necessary to pursue the type of trade and industrial policies deployed successfully in the past by both developed and (some) developing countries. Put simply, the article seeks to ascertain why ultimately CARIFORUM signed an agreement, what it gained from the negotiations and at what cost.

TI GATT, TRIPS, WTO and CBD - Relevance to Agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
AB From the current perspective on 'IPR and Agriculture', there has to be a major discussion on global developments, negotiations and agreements on the role of intellectual property protection on the future of the agricultural sector, a vital segment for ensuring food security for the world population, particularly for developing countries where assuring food security is essential for their survival. Modern day intellectual property protection systems have their genesis in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which was initiated in 1946. Currently, the provisions under several agreements are being implemented by the Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the sole administrative body responsible for all aspects of implementation, monitoring and resolution of disputes between the member countries. Apart from the separate Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) which formed part of GATT, other agreements particularly Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) also impinge heavily on the future of agriculture across the world. It is therefore prudent to evaluate the role that GATT, TRIPS, WTO, CBD and climate change play in the sustenance and development of agriculture pursuits, primarily in the developing and least developed economies.

TI Doha Round: a bad move for development
SO OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS
AB Developing countries represent 2/3 of the members of the WTO but export only 1/3 of total goods and services world trade. This gap between their institutional weight and their commercial power explains why they have succeeded to become effective stakeholders in the WTO negotiation but have failed to move its course towards their needs. All existing models show the gains from liberalisation that developing countries could expect are low and focused on the few emergent countries. The paper analyses the reasons of this situation (modalities of the trade negotiation on agricultural as well as on non agricultural products) and its risks (budgetary costs ten times higher than trade gains, loss of the capacity to adopt economic diversification policies using selective protection).

AB India's pharmaceutical industry is the fourth largest in the world, by volume. However, between 1970 and 2005, the country did not have product patent. Without any product patent, the Indian pharmaceutical industry developed at a very rapid pace. However, due to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), India was required to introduce product patent protection in its patent law. Despite objections to the introduction of product patent, the Indian government revised its patent law in 2005. Specifically, the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 includes some sections aimed at supporting a compulsory licensing regime. In 2012, the Indian government issued the country's first compulsory license against a foreign company's patented drug. This article examines the impact of the India's very first compulsory license on both the Indian pharmaceutical market and the world pharmaceutical market. It also analyzes and offers solutions for both developing countries and foreign companies who wish to avoid the compulsory licensing regime.

TI The Enhancing of the WTO Judiciary's Control over Disputes and
   Suggestions for the Exceptional Expansion of Such Control to Favour
   Developing and Least Developed Countries
SO LAW & PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS
AB The WTO judiciary has enhanced its control over WTO disputes in order to better adjudicate trade controversies. The strengthening of this control is evidenced by the increasing fact-finding powers that the WTO judiciary enjoys today and in the freedom to develop legal argumentation apart from that exposed by parties. While these are the centerpieces of this project, there are also isolated attempts that, although they do not express a deliberate intention to expand such control over the complaining parties' right to set the terms of reference, have had the effect of attenuating this right by allowing the WTO judiciary to adjudicate disputes slightly beyond the terms of reference when to do so has been necessary in order to provide a proper resolution to the conflict. The article draws on these early attempts to suggest that the WTO judiciary could assume more control over disputes in which developing and least developed countries are complainants against developed ones in order to rule on claims not included in the terms of reference originally established.

TI Agricultural Export Subsidies and Domestic Support Reform Under the WTO
   System: What Does It Mean for Welfare in West Africa?
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper analyses the potential welfare impacts West Africa tends to encounter from liberalising agricultural export subsidies and domestic support in developed and developing countries according to the reform proposals of the Doha Development Agenda. We base our analysis on the July framework scenario which considers a tiered formula that adopts a Harbinson Approach plus sensitive and special product provisions. The results indicate that while the world prices of the major exportable commodities of the region will fall, those of their imports will rise. Subsequently, consumers of nearly all of the commodities analysed encounter potential welfare losses, while almost all producers of these commodities experience potential welfare gains. Consumers are expected to encounter an aggregate loss of about $591.93 million, while a net producer surplus of about $423.78 million is expected to be generated. However, because the gains by producers are insufficient to compensate consumers losses, the fifteen West African nations considered in the analysis are expected to experience a net welfare loss of about $168.16 million. On the contrary, large developing countries such as Brazil, India and China as well as developed nations like the EU and Japan are expected to enjoy net welfare gains. The net losses accrued to the region imply more poverty and heightened food insecurity as all West African countries faced severe hunger situation in 2010. However, even though these findings conform to other research results indicating net food importing countries will become losers from agricultural trade reform, while net food exporters experience welfare gains, concerns of data quality and reliability that are usually associated with macrolevel analysis render these results more indicative than definitive.

TI Reform of global trade governance: the role of the European Union
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces an existential crisis. Nominations to the Appellate Body (AB) are deadlocked; tariffs are being raised and retaliated against; and substantive negotiations are stalled. A number of Members, including European Union (EU or the Union) and its Member States, are convinced that the WTO is in need of profound reform, inter alia, with a view to integrating developing countries further, addressing unfair subsidies and state-owned enterprises (SoEs), and optimizing the dispute settlement mechanism (DSM). The EU has recently presented several reform proposals. It has also tightened its domestic tools for enforcing trade obligations and is cooperating with like-minded partners outside the institutional framework of the WTO. The present article looks into the WTO's challenges from a European perspective, with a critical analysis of the EU's proposals for reform, while also highlighting its approach on tackling issues that affect the international economic order outside the WTO.

TI Reflections on a New Democratic South Africa's role in the Multilateral
   Trading System
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB The paper argues that South Africa's participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) since the birth of its democracy in 1994 was informed by its domestic development challenges. It claims that South Africa's values were derived from its long struggle against apartheid and its transition to a new democracy. South Africa's political leadership in the Doha negotiations was also strengthened by its deep democratic institutions and consultative processes. South Africa's values, articulated by Nelson Mandela, reflected a deep commitment to multilateralism and consensus building, fairness and justice, inclusiveness, and a concern to support and promote development, within South Africa, and also in developing countries, especially the African continent. The paper argues that the experiences of South Africa in the multilateral trading system have been inspired by the vision and principles set out by Nelson Mandela. This vision is based on the 'idealist and aspirational' discourse in foreign policy rather than the narrow 'interest driven discourse of realism'.

SO REGION ET DEVELOPPEMENT
AB This paper provides a review of agriculture-related provisions in free trade agreements signed by Latin American countries and in force by December 2004. It is shown that the exceptional treatment received by the agricultural sector in the WTO is also found in free trade agreements. Many agricultural products are excluded from tariff liberalization or are otherwise subject to long phase-out periods. With respect to technical barriers to trade, most agreements go little beyond the reiteration of multilateral commitments. Furthemore, rules of origin are stricter for agricultural goods. This suggests that market access for some developing countries will remain limited. Conversely, provisions on intellectual property protection in free trade agreements, particularly those signed with the United States, go well beyond WTO commitments.

TI Who Uses the Special and Differential Treatment Provisions of the WTO?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Why do some countries promptly implement free trade rules, whereas others opt for slow adaptation? The Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) provisions serve as a tool for the developing and least-developed countries to delay the implementation of World Trade Organization (WTO) free trade rules. SDT supporters point out the positive impacts of the provisions in facilitating free trade in the long term. In their view, developing countries may improve their economic status by increasing their chances of participating in free trade. SDT provisions can play a positive role, although they prolong the prompt implementation offree trade rules. However, not all poor WTO members utilize SDT provisions when implementing free trade rules. Some poor members accept the rules without requesting SDT. This study attempts to answer why some such member countries of the WTO use SDT provisions more than others. We found that member countries' (1) domestic policy implementation capabilities and (2) international socialization determine the utilization of the provisions. When countries lack these factors, they are more likely to request provisions. Our argument is supported by evidence from the implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).

TI Mainstreaming environment and development at the World Trade
   Organization? Fisheries subsidies, the politics of rule-making, and the
   elusive 'triple win'
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB The relationship among trade liberalization, the environment, and socioeconomic development is marked by controversy, though it is well accepted that in practice economic interests often trump environmental concerns and that developing countries incur a range of costs to participate in, and comply with, multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. Politics and power dynamics in the rule-making process in liberalization negotiations are often implicated for generating these outcomes. To improve on this record, and in accordance with the rise in 'market environmentalism', World Trade Organization (WTO) members and advocacy groups have turned this rhetoric on its head and pushed for 'synergy' in which a single WTO rule to discipline fisheries subsidies at once liberalizes trade, generates an environmental improvement, and supports developing country aspirations-a much feted 'triple win'. We sketch the anatomy of the fisheries subsidies negotiations and explore how the triple win is used by blocks of states to justify different political-economic positions. This analysis sheds light on the challenges associated with seeking to use trade for the environment and for development and the dynamics that shape negotiations and the actually existing rules that emerge from the WTO.

Since 2011 it is possible to identify efforts to revitalise negotiations, whereby actual situation differs from the one in 2008, when negotiations collapsed for the last time. Current agricultural prices may help facilitate compromise in the area of the agricultural negotiations; on the other hand the European Union and the United States require a compromise in the area of sectoral negotiations as a condition sine qua non conclusion of the negotiations. Above average unilateral trade liberalisation of developing countries in these sectors justifies demands of the European Union and the United States for a specific approach in this area for ambitious outcomes of the negotiations.

TI The impacts of the World Trade Organization on new members
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB In recent years, there has been intense debate on the effects of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on global trade, triggered by Rose's article (2004) suggesting that the WTO/GATT did not promote world trade at all. In addition, Subramanian and Wei (2007) pointed out a series of asymmetries in trade liberalization led by international organizations. In this paper, we estimate the WTO impact on new members considering both total and disaggregated trade flows from 1995 to 2014 using the gravitational model and Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator. The sample includes bilateral imports from 133 countries in the primary, textile, and industrial sectors. This article provides strong evidence that the WTO has promoted new member trade, but weakly and unevenly between developed and developing countries and across sectors examined. Developed countries continued to benefit most from the increase in world trade promoted by the WTO, but more recent liberalization has also brought gains in exports to the group of the least developed countries (LDCs). Furthermore, the gains, although small, are concentrated in primary products.

TI Circumvention of Trade Defence Measures and Business Ethics
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB With the rise of globalization, the debate around free trade versus fair trade and liberalism versus protectionism has become increasingly complicated. At times, the regulations of the World Trade Organization seem to pit developed markets against emerging markets as governments attempt to expand international trade while at the same time protecting local industry. To this end, antidumping measures have been extensively developed as a way to block foreign low-cost goods (often produced in emerging countries) from entering domestic markets. In response, some exporters have begun to circumvent these antidumping measures using strategies such as transhipment, assembly operations, and slightly modified products. While previous studies have addressed the ethical aspects of antidumping measures, this study will focus on the ethics of circumvention strategies with a special focus on the theories on legal compliance and, specifically, civil disobedience and conscientious evasion.

TI Aid for trade and ecologically sustainable development in Australia's
   international aid program
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB In September 2015, Australia, along with 193 member states of the United Nations, signed the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The facilitation of international trade and increasing foreign aid for developing countries were emphasised as crucial means for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. An important role was assigned to the international Aid for Trade initiative, which is about stimulating economic growth in developing countries through removing constraints to trade. Australia has been a strong supporter of the Aid for Trade initiative since it was launched at the World Trade Organization's Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005. Aid for trade has become a central plank of the new development paradigm' of Australia's international aid program. This article analyses the conceptualisation and practice of aid for trade in Australia's aid, with a focus on how it links to ecologically sustainable development. It argues that Australia's aid for trade is reinforcing the neo-liberal development paradigm in which environmental dimensions are overall neglected and private sector development and free trade are prioritised. In order to achieve international and national development goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development, environmental sustainability needs to be fully integrated into the growing aid for trade portfolio of Australia's international aid.

TI Technical Capacity, Policymaking and Food Standards: An Overview of
   Indian Experience
SO ASIAN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The SPS Agreement in the WTO gives legal validity to the CODEX standards. Since the developed countries have been at the forefront of setting the food standards in the CODEX, the developing countries have been increasingly engaged in the CODEX, and also in the WTO, with an objective to increase their exports of the agricultural and food products. But such objective and desire have often been stymied by the lack of institutions which can sustain the intense technical negotiations at the CODEX. If these participations are not qualitatively satisfactory, the very objective of such participations is not fulfilled. But since most of the developing countries are lacking in such high technical capacity, they are unable to influence or qualitatively shape the negotiations in the CODEX. This also impacts their exports of agricultural and food products.
   India has been an active member of the WTO. But whether it has been able to influence or respond to the play of events internationally and concomitantly balance it with the domestic imperatives that are embedded in the international legal and technological regimes, institutional capacity constraints and other social issues. This paper examines such issues, and also examines some bilateral trade agreements which demonstrate the mounting pressure on the developing countries to conform to the food standards of the developed countries.

TI Relative Factor Return Gaps in Labour Markets and Global Integration
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB The paper estimates the role of integration in welfare generation in a cross country framework. Once controlling for institutions, openness is generally associated with increased wage inequalities across nations. However the results for trade policy are mixed. Decrease in import taxes increase wage inequality, whereas decrease in export taxes has an egalitarian effect. The results are applicable only to the larger sample of developed and developing countries. The results highlight the bottle neck faced by both developing and developed countries in WTO talks which have not been successful as yet in terms of further decrease in trade taxes. In case this situation prevails, the paper calls for more South-South trade which would enable developing countries to decrease the relative wage gaps among their labour force.

SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB In 2006, a group of biodiversity-rich countries including Brazil, Peru, and India proposed a new Art. 29(bis) to the WTO's TRIPS Agreement, which aims at protecting biodiversity by making it mandatory for patent applicants to reveal the origin of the biological resources or traditional knowledge from which the subject matter of the patent application is derived. Further, they shall provide evidence of compliance with the legal requirements in the providing country for prior informed consent for access and fair and equitable benefit-sharing of commercial uses. Dozens of other developing countries have voiced their support for this proposal. However, Brazil itself only managed to fully implement this so-called "certificate of legal provenance" in its national legislation by the beginning of 2007. This latest development is analysed, taking into account the respective legal situation in the Andean Community and in Costa Rica.

TI Price volatility, tariff structure and the special safeguard mechanism
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB Specific tariffs, which are levied per unit of imports, have often been shown to be discriminatory against poor countries; it is because they export low-value goods that face a higher tariff burden in ad valorem terms than high-value goods for the same specific tariff. However, specific tariffs also have a positive aspect of being able to insulate the domestic economy from global price volatility. The Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) is a proposed policy in the World Trade Organization (WTO) that is intended to help poor countries to be able to shield their domestic agriculture from low import prices by giving them flexibility to increase tariffs; however, the SSM causes an increase in price volatility. Therefore, specific tariffs may reduce the price volatility effects of the SSM. Aiming to test this hypothesis, our work implements the SSM and specific tariffs in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling framework. We find decreased variability of producer prices, import prices, and output in most developed and developing countries when specific tariffs are accounted for. This work illustrates the potentially stabilizing effects of specific tariffs in the presence of the SSM, and highlights the importance of tariff regime modeling when considering the economic effects of international trade policy measures.

AB Globalisation is pushing higher education towards greater international involvement, a process often referred to as the 'internationalisation of higher education': integrating an international dimension into the teaching, research and service functions of higher education institutions. Many apprehensions surround the liberalisation of higher education in India. The obligations of members of the WTO towards the GATS regime and the present scenario of higher education and the rest of the world are analysed. Certain policy measures are formulated and offered for consideration before liberalising higher education services in India.

E-commerce has resulted in fundamental changes to the traditional working practices of SMEs. Recently, many studies have explored critical factors influencing the successful adoption of e-commerce. The objective of this chapter is to provide an exhaustive review of prior theoretical literature on the factors that impact the successful adoption of e-commerce in SMEs and identification of the stages of the adoption process in organisation. Four groups of factors are discussed including technological, organizational, entrepreneurial and environmental factors.

TI Why Are So Many WTO Disputes Abandoned?
SO TRADE DISPUTES AND THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE WTO: AN
   INTERDISCIPLINARY ASSESSMENT
SE Frontiers of Economics and Globalization
AB Previous research on the success of the WTO dispute-settlement system may miscalculate the true benefits of the dispute process due to the nature of the datasets used. Approximately 33 percent of all disputes. led at the WTO are classified as pending or inactive and thus omitted from most studies. Further investigation reveals that many of these inactive cases were actually settled by the countries involved or considered in a similar WTO dispute, and, as a result, no further WTO action was taken. This suggests that the WTO dispute settlement process may be more effective in resolving disputes than otherwise thought. For those disputes not successfully resolved, I empirically estimate why countries may choose to initiate WTO dispute settlement action but fail to follow through, thus allowing the offending party to continue with the alleged WTO illegal activities. The results suggest that developing countries are less likely to resolve their complaints in the WTO dispute settlement system, a troubling implication for the equity of the system.

TI Are more restrictive food cadmium standards justifiable health safety
   measures or opportunistic barriers to trade? An answer from economics
   and public health
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In the past, Cd regulations have imposed trade restrictions on foodstuffs from some developing countries seeking to access markets in the developed world and in recent years, there has been a trend towards imposing more rigorous standards. This trend seems to respond more to public and private sectors strategies in some developed countries to create disguised barriers to trade and to improve market competitiveness for their industries, than to scientifically justified health precautions (sanitary and phytosanitary measures) and/or technical barriers to trade acceptable under the Uruguay Round Agreement of the WTO. Applying more rigorous Cd standards in some developed countries will not only increase production costs in developing countries but it will also have a large impact on their economies highly dependent on international agricultural markets. In the current literature there are large uncertainties in the cause-effect relationship between current levels of Cd intakes and eventual health effects in human beings; even the risk of Cd to kidney function is under considerable debate. Recent works on the importance of zinc:Cd ratio rather than Cd levels alone to determine Cd risk factors, on the one hand, and on the declining trends of Cd level in foods and soils, on the other, also indicate a lack of scientific evidence justifying more restrictive cadmium standards. This shows that developing countries should fight for changing and making more transparent the current international structures and procedures for setting sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade.

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB In the wake of devastating floods in Pakistan in 2010, the European Union (EU) has attempted to use trade policy to provide humanitarian assistance by the temporary lowering of tariffs on select imports from Pakistan. This Proposal,justified on humanitarian grounds, requires a World Trade Organization (WTO) waiver, which so far has not been possible, amidst developing countries' concerns regarding erosion of the value of their preferential access to the EU market. A detailed examination of the EU Proposal indicates marginal benefit to Pakistan at best, given that sensitive import-competing products were largely excluded, suggesting that protectionist interests had a hand in shaping the policy. The findings also suggest that trade policy might not be an effective means to provide humanitarian assistance.

AB It has been argued that restrictions on industrial policy implemented under World Trade Organization rules in the 2000s have greatly reduced the policy space' in which developing countries can promote industrialisation. This paper examines the case of Thailand's policies in developing one of the most successful automotive industries in the Southeast Asian region. We show that Thailand's use of local content requirements, later abolished under WTO rules, helped promote local suppliers and did not deter foreign investors. Substantial tariff protection of vehicles and components production did not deter exports, and has continued to the present, even under liberalisation policies. Supplementing tariff protection by various fiscal means to promote product champions in the automotive industry, Thailand has succeeded in retaining substantial policy freedom.

TI Emerging Regulation for Digital Economy: Challenges and Opportunities
   for Multilateral Global Governance
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB The role of information and communications technology (ICT), high-speed communication infrastructure, digital content and the digital economy as a whole is rapidly growing in the post-pandemic society. Simultaneously, competition for digital technologies and solutions and the contest to influence norms, standards and regulatory mechanisms is escalating. The new regulatory mechanisms and approaches are concurrently being shaped in the key international institutions, including the United Nations (UN), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU), the Group of 20 (G20) and the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
   This article presents analysis of the current cooperation on issues of digital economy regulation within the main international institutions. The study aims to assess the influence of the existing and emerging regulatory mechanisms on the balance of power between the key international actors.
   This assessment of the emerging mechanisms' impact on the balance of power among international actors indicates that advantages and leverage capabilities accruing from them are distributed unevenly. The advanced members of the OECD and the G20 gain significant advantages, and there is a risk that the new mechanisms will consolidate the balance of power embodied by the Bretton Woods system, which has successfully resisted decadeslong endeavours for its reform.
   However, regulation of the digital economy is not yet built as an established order. A window of opportunity was opened in 2020, not only to implement the G20's 2008 pledge to reform the international financial and economic architecture, but also to build a new digital economy governance system, ensuring that emerging markets and developing countries have a voice in decision-making commensurate with their weight in the global economy.
   The article is structured in three parts. The introduction presents the research questions and objectives and describes the parameters of comparative analysis and influence assessment criteria. The second section reviews the emerging mechanisms and instruments and reflects on their influence on the balance of power. The third section puts forward conclusions and recommendations for enhancing the influence of emerging markets and developing countries on the shaping and functioning of the emerging digital economy's regulatory mechanisms.

TI Demystify Protectionism: The WTO Trade Policy Review of Japan
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper reviews the eighth Trade Policy Review (TPR) for Japan. It begins with an appreciation of its fair and well-balanced work in updating knowledge on the progress of policy reform in Japan. The TPR confirms the recovery of the Japanese economy with some notable improvements in its policy environment, the example of which is competition policy. On the other hand, there still remain notable trade impediments, particularly in agriculture. Some agricultural products are still heavily protected by complicated border measures. This paper provides some supplementary information, namely that the domestic production of most of the heavily protected products, with the exception of rice, are highly concentrated geographically, suggesting the politico-economic background. The rise of regionalism is mentioned as another topical issue in Japan though the characteristics and significance of free trade agreement networking by Japan are not fully discussed by the TPR. The TPR praises Japan's effort in providing the generalised system of preferences (GSP), but this paper offers a somewhat sceptical view of the role of GSP as a useful tool for developing countries. Overall, the TPR for Japan is assessed as a good starting point for dealing with the remaining issues on international commercial policies in Japan.

It is pointed out in this article that, taking the case of commercial industry as an example, we should view international division of work from different angles.

TI Liminal Spaces: Special and Differential Treatment as an Incompletely
   Theorised Agreement
SO MANCHESTER JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Drawing on earlier work by the author on the application of economic contract theory to preferential treatment in favour of developing countries, this article is intended to provoke some reflections on special and differential treatment within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The concept of special and differential treatment, defined as measures which aim to address developing and least developed countries (LDC) relevant development, financial and trade needs, has the potential for far-reaching impacts within the trading regime, depending upon how it is interpreted. This article seeks to develop a theoretical perspective on special and differential treatment. In developing this perspective, Cass Sunstein's theory of the incompletely theorised agreement is utilised to interrogate the core features of special and differential treatment. Using this analytical lens, the article traces the construction of special and differential treatment as an incompletely theorised agreement and elucidates on the consequences of this for the operation of such treatment as an effective tool to address the development, financial and trade needs of developing countries. The article then evaluates recent changes to special and differential treatment which can be construed as an effort to more completely theorise such treatment. The article concludes by positing that special and differential treatment currently resides within a liminal or transitional space. By tracing the contours of such liminality, and through the use of the lens of the incompletely theorised agreement, this article seeks to contribute original insights to this area of trade law and practice.

TI Re-negotiating trade and labor standards in a post Hong Kong scenario
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB This paper analyses the various contours of the trade-labor linkage in the context of the rapid growth of the world trading system, and argues for a multifaceted approach in order to improve global labor conditions. At present, labor standards are outside the purview of the WTO regime. However, ever since the Havana Charter, a large section of the developed countries opine that the WTO ought to encompass labor standards within its regulatory framework. They primary argument rests on the premise that core labor standards are already enshrined within the WTO framework, in the Preamble, Article XY and Article XXIX. Moreover, they argue that express incorporation would go a long way in strengthening the world trading system as well as the currently "toothless" ILO. Of great concern is their fear that developing countries would be able to significantly reduce the cost of their goods by deliberate attempts to lower labor conditions. On the other hand, developing countries staunchly oppose any form of incorporation, arguing that it would lead to a large monetary burden, disruption of export opportunities and convolution of the WTO system. It is necessary, however, to proceed with caution. In its ever widening scope, the WTO is certain to have profound effects on global labor standards. However, while attempting to include them within its ambit, the WTO must not lose sight of its core ideals.

TI US-China conflict in global trade governance: the new politics of
   agricultural subsidies at the WTO
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This article shows how China's rise has radically altered the politics of one of the most prominent and controversial issues in the global trading system: agriculture subsidies. Agriculture subsidies depress global prices and undermine the competitiveness and livelihoods of poor farmers, and therefore have been long seen as a symbol of the injustice of the trading system. The issue has traditionally been understood in North-South terms, with developed countries seen as the perpetrators of harm and developing countries as innocent victims. In this article, however, I challenge this prevailing conception of the agricultural subsidies issue, arguing that it is now out of date and no longer corresponds with the emerging reality. A momentous but underappreciated change has taken place, largely beneath the radar of IPE scholarship: China has emerged as the world's largest subsidizer, profoundly transforming the global politics of agricultural subsidies. From a North-South battle, WTO negotiations on agricultural subsidies are now primarily centered on a conflict between the US and China. While reducing subsidies remains a pressing concern for developing countries, efforts to negotiate new and strengthened disciplines at the WTO have been thwarted by an impasse between the two dominant powers.

It examines the dynamics of the meeting, the emergence of a new negotiating mode, and the contestations between key developing and developed members; it explores the substance of the deal negotiated; and it reflects on the future capacity of the WTO to serve as a means of securing trade gains for developing and least developed countries. Three arguments are advanced. First, the use of a new mode of negotiating brought participation and consensus into the core of the Nairobi talks, but it also resulted in an agreement that moves away from the pursuit of universal agreements to one wherein more narrowly focused piecemeal deals can be brokered. Second, the package of trade measures agreed continues an established pattern of asymmetrical trade deals that favour developed members over their developing and least developed counterparts. Third, Nairobi alters fundamentally the likely shape of future WTO deals with significant consequences for developing country trade gains. The likely result is that while Nairobi will energise the multilateral system it will do so in a way that is of questionable value to developing and least developed countries.

TI Plaintiffs by proxy: A firm-level approach to WTO dispute resolution
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Lobbying by multinational business firms drives the agenda of international trade politics. We match Fortune Global 500 firms to WTO disputes in which they have a stake and to their political activities using public disclosure data. The quantitative evidence reveals traces of a principal-agent relationship between major MNCs and the US Trade Representative (USTR). Firms lobby and make political contributions to induce the USTR to lodge a WTO dispute, and once a dispute begins, firms increase their political activity in order to keep USTR on track. Lobbying is overwhelmingly patriotic-the side opposing the US position is barely represented-and we see little evidence of MNCs lobbying against domestic protectionism. When the United States is targeted in a dispute, lobbying by defendant-side firms substantially delays settlement, as the affected firms pressure the government to reject concessions. Lobbying on the complainant side does not delay dispute resolution, as complainant-side firms have mixed incentives, to resolve disputes quickly as well as to hold out for better terms.

TI The "public body" enquiry in WTO disputes: implications for partial
   privatization
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose This paper aims to question the "conventional" privatization of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to propose the neutral position adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) to reconcile the divergent views within the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime. Design/methodology/approach China's partially privatized SOEs have raised numerous attention in WTO disputes regarding whether China's way of social and economic reform is consistent with its accession commitments and with WTO rules, in particular subsidy rules. Instead of providing a definite legal standard applicable to the "public body" enquiry, the DSB adopts the neutral position to reconcile the divergent views between developed and developing countries on whether not fully privatized SOEs constitute "public body." Findings Albeit with interpretative vagueness, the value of DSB's neutral position lies in its adequacy: first, the adequacy to address the complexity of SOE privatizations in developing countries; second, the adequacy to engage relevant parties to maintain the multilateral trading system; and third, not to impose specific impact on justification of countervailing duties. Originality/value This paper captures the recent developments in "public body" enquiry and calls for a compromised approach to maintain the WTO-like multilateral trade regime and to allow for more policy spaces for developing countries that best fit their unique circumstances and needs. It sees new and significant information, in the sense that the paper aims to present why China's partial privatization benefits from the WTO "neutrality" on the subject.

TI Global pharmaceutical regulation: the challenge of integration for
   developing states
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: This paper has set out to map the state of pharmaceutical regulation in the developing world through the construction of cross-national indices drawing from World Health Organization data. The last two decades have been characterized by deep changes for the pharmaceutical sector, including the complete transformation of intellectual property systems at the behest of the World Trade Organization and the consolidation of global active ingredient suppliers in China and India. Although the rules for ownership of medicine have been set and globally implemented, we know surprisingly little about how the standards for market entrance and regulation of pharmaceutical products have changed at the national level. How standardized are national pharmaceutical market systems? Do we find homogeneity or variation across the developing world? Are their patterns for understanding why some countries have moved closer to one global norm for pharmaceutical regulation and others have developed hybrid models for oversight of this sector? Access to medicine is a core tool in public health. This paper gauges the levels of standards in public and private generics markets for developing countries building on national-level pharmaceutical market surveys for 78 countries to offer three indicators of market oversight: State Regulatory Infrastructure, Monitoring the Private Market and Public Quality Control. Identifying the different variables that affect a state's institutional capacity and current standard level offers new insights to the state of pharmaceuticals in the developing world. It is notable that there are very few (none at the time of this paper) studies that map out the new global terrain for pharmaceutical regulation in the post-TRIPS context.
   Results: This paper uses item response theory to develop original indicators of pharmaceutical regulation. We find remarkable resistance to the implementation of global pharmaceutical norms for quality standards in developing states and in regulatory infrastructure. Human capacity across many developing countries remains limited. Most notably, variation among states is stark. Countries that have been leaders in establishing global norms do not appear to have influenced their neighbors in establishing regional patterns. Finally, in contrast to traditional theories of international norms diffusion, global standard-setters such as the United States or European Union appear to have surprisingly little influence on standard setting across our survey.
   Conclusions: Our research has implications for the framing of technical support on public health initiatives aimed at strengthening local public institutions in medicine and offers a new methodological approach for analyzing drug regulation systems in developing countries.

TI International Microtrade Regime - Structure and Financing
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The conceptualization of a new form of trade, microtrade, is visualized to hold great promise in economic development of the producers belonging to LDCs and developing countries. In order to meet the goal of poverty reduction at a sustainable pace, the institutional, financial and logistical mechanisms for facilitating microtrade both at the international and national level needs to be built in a manner which ensures maximum efficiency. The paper deals with two fundamental aspects of development of microtrade. First, it delineates different aspects which would provide a strong substratum to the proposed microtrade regime. It explores the legal and institutional framework required for conduct of microtrade, which can be structured under the existing WTO regime and proposes necessary amendments to the WTO regime. Second, the paper explores financial aspects of the proposed microtrade regime. A case study of operation of micro-credit in the Indian scenario is undertaken in order to highlight the problems which have recently emerged in the microfinance sector. The scale of these problems has led the Indian government to propose a bill, regulating microfinance in India. Cue from this experience needs to be taken in order to move towards a foolproof system of financing microtrade at the local level.

TI Statutory Safeguards and Privileges for Developing Countries in the WTO
   Dispute Settlement System
SO CHINA AND WTO REVIEW
AB The era of globalization has created a proverbial 'rush' to utilize trade and investment in developing nations. Growing fear over the abuse of developed nations' bargaining power in these areas led the WTO to adopt remedial measures ensuring the protection of developing nations during disputes. The WTO's dispute settlement system is unequivocally the most comprehensive form of the resolution of disputes among its Member States. Despite the numerous privileges and safeguards offered to developing Members States, reluctance and a lack of understanding in using the WTO dispute resolution process remain within these nations. This paper explains the options available to these nations, in an attempt to attract to use the dispute resolution process, and offers key insight on future amendments that can facilitate developing Member's participation in the future. It will further articulate the statutory safeguards and favors provided to developing countries in DSS.

TI Harmonizing International Trade and Climate Change Institutions: Legal
   and Theoretical Basis for Systemic Integration
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Despite increased global awareness that measures, policies and rules aimed at combating climate change may act as barriers to international trade; trade and climate change regimes continue to operate at the international level, without the desired level of coherence and harmony. While emission reduction obligations are negotiated under the purview of the United Nations Framework Convention on Change (UNFCCC); trade-related rules and regimes are under the purview of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The result is the proliferation of several international obligations, standards, procedures and requirements that ultimately make international trade more difficult; and efforts to combat climate change, less concerted. For example, the availability, affordability and accessibility of environmentally sustainable technologies (ESTs) needed in developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change is occurring at a slower pace due to different technology importation requirements, efficiency standards, trade requirements and WTO procedures; while unilateral measures adopted in developed countries such as the alternative energy programs and the "food mile" policy; currently threaten the importation of goods produced in developing countries. The result is an international legal system where emission reduction obligations overlap and sometimes conflict with trade obligations and vice versa.
   A solution to this problem is the harmonization and integration of trade and climate change obligations and institutions, through a coordinated and holistic approach. This approach would include taking into account the institutional aspects of these relationships and establishing more normative platforms for cross-fertilization between trade and climate change regimes. This paper evokes the importance of the principles of systemic integration and coherent interpretation of international law obligations laid down in Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in arguing that the idea of integrating obligations established in climate change treaties with obligations in trade instruments is a mandatory requirement of treaty interpretation and implementation under international law.

TI Challenged in Geneva: WTO Litigation Experience and the Design of
   Preferential Trade Agreements
SO BUSINESS AND POLITICS
AB What explains the design of international institutions? Existing research has largely neglected how experience in cooperation in one set of international institutions impacts on design choices made by states in other globally-oriented institutions. We contribute to this evolving debate by analyzing spillovers in experience in international trade. We argue that countries' track record of interaction in multilateral trade disputes affects the design of their preferential trade agreements (PTAs). If a country participates in a complaint against a prospective PTA partner at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the challenge in Geneva alerts the defendant's import-competing industries with respect to potential challenges under the planned PTA. As a result, these industries exert pressure on their government to preserve leeway under the future treaty, leading to increased flexibility and a lower level of enforcement in the PTA. We find support for our hypotheses in an empirical analysis of 347 PTAs concluded post 1990.

TI Heterogeneous impacts of finance on firm exports: Evidence from export
   deregulation in a large developing country
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper investigates the heterogeneous effects of finance on firm exports through the lens of differential exporting modes. China's WTO accession leads to an export deregulation, which empowers private domestic firms with low registered capital to export directly. This quasinatural experiment encourages firms switching from indirect to direct exporting, and thus provides an ideal setting to explore the heterogeneous effects of finance on exports among switchers and non-switchers. Applying the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to a comprehensive survey data on Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that finance improves exports more for firms switching from indirect to direct exporting, relative to continuous indirect exporters. Our mechanism analysis shows that finance manifests a more pronounced encouraging effect on firm-level operation efficiency and productivity among switchers. Moreover, we show that the heterogeneous effects of finance on exports among switchers and non-switchers are more pronounced in the post-WTO accession period. The time-varying heterogeneous impacts suggest an economic loss caused by the export distortion before China's WTO accession because it prevents productive yet financially constrained private domestic firms from direct exporting.

HO World Trade Inst
AB This paper addresses conceptual problems of special and differential (S&D) treatment of developing countries (DCs). Observing that past and present avenues have largely failed, it suggests the concept of progressive regulation in the field of prescriptive rules. Based on the idea of progressive liberalization, it develops a new concept of graduation inherent to substantive rules and suggests taking recourse to individual scheduling of commitments. Learning from the idea of progressive liberalization, commensurate to diverging levels of development, it is submitted that graduation, based on recourse to economic factors within substantive rules, and scheduling of additional commitments could replace traditional perceptions of S&D treatment and render World Trade Organization (WTO) more responsive to the needs of developing Member States of the WTO. As an example, this paper applies these concepts to the problem of patenting pharmaceutical products.

TI The WTO in an Era of Preferential Trade Agreements: Thick and Thin
   Institutions in Global Trade Governance
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB This article examines how fragmentation of the global trade regime into preferential agreements, built on a multilateral baseline of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, affects trade governance. The analysis relies on 105 interviews with trade policy professionals in core WTO members and a conceptual distinction between thick' and thin' institutionalism to capture institutional changes in the global trade governance architecture. The WTO's thick institutionalism facilitates institutionalized interactions among members of the trade policy community that are essential for transparency and dialogue and the rule of law character of the trade regime. It secures the continued belief of trade policy professionals in the WTO's centrality in trade governance. The thin institutionalism of the network of preferential agreements spells the return to a la carte forms of trade governance and benefits those with the technical and political capacity to successfully navigate the fragmented governance architecture. Ongoing institutional transformations shift global trade governance away from rules-based back to more power-based forms.

AB This article examines the nature and the extent of the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the activities of the World Trade Organization (WTO). First, it looks at the arguments for and against NGO involvement in WTO activities. Next, the article discusses the legal basis for the involvement of NGOs in WTO activities and the various forms of involvement provided for. It compares the position of NGOs in the WTO with their position in other international organizations, in particular, the United Nations. Subsequently, the article explores the practice of WTO engagement with NGOs. Finally, it examines and compares the rules and procedures of the WTO and the United Nations for the selection of the NGOs with which to engage. This article concludes that a more open and engaged dialogue with civil society will make the WTO a more transparent and responsive organization, enjoying greater support among the general public in developed as well as developing country Members. Justified concerns about the legitimacy, accountability, and politics of NGOs could be eliminated, or at least mitigated, by introducing a system of accreditation in the WTO. While NGO involvement in the WTO definitely has its limits, the involvement of NGOs in other international organizations, in particular, the United Nations, suggests that these limits have not been reached as yet.

SO BUSINESS AND POLITICS
AB Over the last 60 years, the multilateral management of trade through the GATT and subsequently through the WTO has been led by the United States and Europe. Since the turn of the new millennium, however, developing countries have increasingly used their leverage to insist that talks on agriculture receive priority attention, deny the inclusion of investment and competition policy on the negotiating agenda, and block agreement on negotiating modalities for agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA). Cooperation between the United States and the European Union is still essential, but no longer sufficient, for successful multilateral negotiations. Specifically, the "BRICKs" (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Korea) are likely to be pivotal in directing the course and contributing to the success or failure of the WTO.

In this context, the article explores the practical and political aspects of the interface between the indigenous rights relating to the traditional knowledge of such 'natural medicines' and the interests of the countries and companies that build on that knowledge in providing widely available and improved medicines. The article refers to traditional knowledge databases and looks at two regimes of prior informed consent and benefit sharing, the contractual and disclosure approaches. Many of the key issues are highly political, with developed and developing countries having widely different approaches. The article concludes that many of these issues are likely to run for many years before being fully resolved. (C) 2007 Peter S. Harrison. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The World Bank's Linkage model of the global economy is employed to examine the impact first of current trade barriers and agricultural subsidies, and then of possible outcomes from the WTO's Doha round. The results suggest moving to free global merchandise trade would boost real incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa proportionately more than in other developing countries or in high-income countries, despite a terms of trade loss in parts of the region. Farm employment and output, the real value of agricultural and food exports, the real returns to farm land and unskilled labour, and real net farm incomes would all rise in the region, thereby alleviating poverty. Results for a Doha partial liberalisation of both agricultural and non-agricultural trades take the region only a small part of the way towards those desirable outcomes.

TI The impact of further tariff reduction on the EU sugar sector in the
   forthcoming multilateral round
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE IN FINLAND
AB This paper indicates the need for reform in the EU sugar sector due to the erosion of border protection in terms of further reduction in import tariffs for sugar. Three tariff reduction methods are assessed to project the border protection for EU sugar: Swiss formula proposed by the Cairns Group, Harbinson proposal by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Uruguay Round formula proposed by the EU. In the assumed forthcoming multilateral round for agriculture, the EU would need to lower the support price for sugar by 67%, if the Cairns Group tariff reduction method is used. However, if the Harbinson method is used, the EU would need to lower the support price for sugar by at least 35%. On the contrary, the EU may avoid lowering the support price for sugar under three concurrent conditions: 1) the Uruguay Round formula is used as the reduction method in the new WTO round and the EU can use the minimum reduction rate of 15% for sugar; 2) world sugar prices will recover in the future; and 3) both developed and developing countries are allowed to use the Special Safeguard Provisions.

TI The GATS: a legal perspective on crossroads of conflicting interests
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB The GATS was concluded among countries with conflicting interests. Although all its parties were interested in this agreement as an instrument for the enhancement of global trade in services, due balance between this interest and other interests, such as the special status of developing countries and of the sovereign right of Members for domestic regulation, formed a pre-condition for countries' adherence to it. Consequently, these interests were explicitly recognized in the agreement. Nevertheless, analyzing two recent GATS/GATT cases, US Gambling and China Publications and AV Products, the article suggests that the WTO adjudicating bodies might be keener to legally assist a complaining developing Member than respondents which are developing Members. It further suggests that in these cases the interests of international trade liberalization seem to prevail over domestic policy goals. The article further analyzes the current and future possible adverse implications of this approach on GATS development as the only multilateral instrument for the enhancement of international trade in services.

TI Food security: Food trade regime and food aid regime
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB This article examines the implications of the linkage between two international regimes for food security. The WTO food trade regime influences Members' trade policies affecting food-related entitlements and may thus have an impact on food security, while the changing trade environment has undermined the traditional role of the world food aid regime in food security. Many developing countries, especially least developed and net food-importing countries may face more food difficulties than before, at least in the short term. It appears that different international regimes could produce incoherent effects on food security, even if they neither contain conflicting rules nor impose competing obligations on member States. The major reason for this situation maybe lies in the fact that food security is a complex issue involved with various factors and that a certain international regime designed to achieve a specific objective sometimes does not take into account all of these factors. Therefore, institutional cooperation and coordination are needed to redress adverse effects that may result from incoherence between international regimes.

Exploring two trade liberalization shocks, Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992 and China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, we analyze whether regions more exposed to globalization experienced larger changes in wage inequality than less-exposed regions. Contrary to the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, we find that the WTO accession was significantly associated with rising wage inequality. We further show that both trade liberalizations contributed to within-region inequality by raising the returns to education (the returns to high school after 1992 and the returns to college after 2001).

TI Multilateral trade measures in a post-2012 climate change regime? What
   can be taken from the Montreal Protocol and the WTO?
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The climate-trade nexus gains increasing attention as governments are taking great efforts to forge a post-2012 climate change regime to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. This raises the issues of the scope of trade-related measures and of when and how they could be used. This paper discusses how far trade-related measures should be incorporated in that context. Drawing on an analogy to the Montreal Protocol and comparing developing country's climate mitigation and adaptation needs with the funding available, the paper argues that such measures should initially be applied only among Annex I or If countries. To discipline the use of unilateral trade measures at the international level, the paper emphasizes a need to define comparable climate efforts. Moreover, the Lieberman-Warner bill in the US Senate-taken as a proxy for future US climate legislation-is assessed, and found to be neither effective nor likely to be WTO-consistent. The paper is concluded by arguing that, in order to encourage developing countries to do more to combat climate change, developed countries should focus on carrots. Sticks can be incorporated, but only if they are credible and realistic and serve as a useful supplement to push developing countries to take actions or adopt policies and measures earlier than would otherwise have been the case.

TI REDESIGNING THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS AT THE WTO
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The negotiation structure at the World Trade Organization (WTO) primarily relies on the single undertaking, an all or nothing approach that typically precludes separate agreements among some of the parties or on some of the agenda items. This article argues for a re-examination of the value of the single undertaking, particularly with reference to developing country Members. With respect to the substantive negotiations, 'linkage' (the inter-dependent regulation of trade and other fields that are deemed to have an impact on trade) has been a powerful principle for the expansion of WTO regulation and the single undertaking has, so far, served as the vector to implement linkage. As a counterpoint, this article argues that linkage can and should be decoupled from negotiation design, particularly from the unquestioned and systematic recourse to the single undertaking. The article offers avenues for redesigning negotiations beyond the old dichotomy of the single undertaking versus 'a-la-carte' approaches. It proposes alternative negotiation structures that take into account the practical realities of many WTO Members with limited institutional capacity as well as the desirability for some Members to liberalize trade at a faster pace.

TI The Impact of Globalization of Antitrust Law on Developing Countries:
   Harmony or Hegemony?
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB In the light of today's rampant globalization, there is an increasing need for developing a system of antitrust that serves to regulate the world market. This article describes the problems relating to the globalization of antitrust in the face of differing, and often conflicting, aims of domestic antitrust law and argues that a globally applicable system of antitrust needs to treat all state players in the global market equally by taking into account the needs of each domestic economy.
   Since domestic antitrust law is aimed at protecting domestic interests, a globally applicable system of antitrust must recognize the dissymmetry between the goals of antitrust in developed and developing countries, and will require a single global antitrust policy which should inform the domestic jurisprudence of all states, thereby forcing domestic authorities to also take into account the interests of foreign jurisdictions so as to not impede economic development abroad.
   Harmonization of antitrust should reflect the interests of the global market, which would be best regulated by a system based on a global antitrust policy that addresses the specific needs of developing economies and aims at establishing a more level playing field in the global economic arena.
   Owing to the self-interest inherent in state actions and domestic systems of antitrust, a neutral international body such as the World Trade Organization will need to establish a globally applicable antitrust policy, and facilitate both its initial negotiation and its enforcement.

TI States Held Hostage: Political Hold- Up Problems and the Effects of
   International Institutions
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB This paper argues that the benefits of international institutions accrue disproportionately to pairs of states that find cooperation most difficult. It determines which states achieve the greatest gains from these institutions by identifying a central reason that states fail to cooperate in international relations: they fear being 'held up' by other states for political concessions. Political hold-up problems occur when one state fails to undertake an otherwise productive investment due to the increased ability it would give another state to extract political concessions. Focusing on the World Trade Organization (WTO), I demonstrate that political hold-up problems are pervasive in international relations due to links between economic and political policies, but that international institutions can solve hold-up problems by helping to enforce agreements. I first formalize this argument and then empirically test the implications derived from the model, finding that the WTO increases trade most for politically dissimilar states by reducing states' abilities to hold up their trading partners for foreign policy concessions. I provide evidence of the causal mechanism by showing that WTO membership increases trade in contract-intensive goods and boosts fixed capital investment. I conclude that by solving political hold-up problems, international institutions can normalize relations between politically asymmetric states that differ in terms of capabilities, regime types, and alliances.

SP EAAE
AB This paper tries to estimate the effects of reforming European agricultural trade policy on poverty in Europe and in the developing world. After setting out a conceptual framework linking trade and poverty, it describes a detailed computable general equilibrium modelling exercise showing the effects on poverty of a possible agreement in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization. It then conducts a global simulation on European agricultural liberalisation and by comparing it with the Doha simulations infers the poverty effects in the developing world. These are benign but not very large. This does not change the case for reform, however; the Common Agricultural Policy harms trade relations with developing countries and causes poverty in Europe.

TI How China Navigated the Dilemma of Trade Liberalization and Government
   Revenues
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB Many economists believe that in the long run, the aggregate performance of open economies is better than that of closed ones, and that open policies contribute significantly to economic development. At the same time, many political scientists and policy makers fear that, in the short run, one of the steps towards openness trade liberalization may harm government revenues. However, in the 1990s, China successfully navigated the dilemma of trade liberalization and government revenues. In this period, China decreased tariff and non-tariff barriers for WTO accession, but has achieved dramatically increased tariff revenues since 1999. This study explores how China implemented trade liberalization and simultaneously increased tariff revenues in the 1990s. It demonstrates that a series of institutional arrangements, including a reform of Criminal Law, rigorous anti-smuggling activities and a de facto tax imposed on the export sector, successfully curbed smuggling activities through the processing trade, and made foreign-invested manufacturing enterprises the major contributors to the stability of customs revenue. China's case shows that a prosperous, export-oriented and foreign-invested manufacturing sector could potentially provide a developing country with a source of customs revenue.

TI Different paths to power: The rise of Brazil, India and China at the
   World Trade Organization
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB New powers, such as China, India and Brazil, are challenging the traditional dominance of the US in the governance of the global economy. It is generally taken for granted that the rise of new powers is simply a reflection of their growing economic might. In this article, however, I challenge this assumption by drawing on the case of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to show that the forces driving the rise of new powers are more heterogeneous and complex than suggested by a simple economic determinism. I argue that these countries have in fact taken different paths to power: while China's rise has been more closely tied to its growing economic might, the rise of Brazil and India has been driven primarily by their mobilization and leadership of developing country coalitions, which enabled them to exercise influence above their economic weight. One important result is that Brazil and India have assumed a more aggressive and activist position in WTO negotiations than China and played a greater role in shaping the agenda of the Doha Round. Thus, although the new powers are frequently grouped together (as the 'BRICs', for example), this masks considerable variation in their sources of power and behaviour in global economic governance.

TI DIGITAL TRADE, DEVELOPMENT, AND INEQUALITY
SO AJIL UNBOUND
AB The links between and among digital trade, development, and inequality are multifaceted and ever evolving. They depend on what is understood as development and as inequality, concepts that transcend the North-South divide, and the fora in which these issues arise. Conceptually, development and inequality are intrinsically intertwined as the measures to address both are often complementary or even the same. In this essay, we consider development and inequality as pertaining to the ability of developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs) to shape and participate in the digital economy, and particularly, the regulatory framework for digital trade. We explore how the relationships between digital trade, development, and inequality are addressed in the main venues for digital trade rulemaking: the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). We then examine two contentious issues in digital trade: the customs duty moratorium and data governance.

TI Bargaining in the negotiations over liberalizing trade in services:
   power, reciprocity and learning
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The succesful conclusion of the 1997 WTO agreements on trade in basic telemcommunication and financial services surprised many observers. During the negotiations, US officials took a hard line in demanding improved offers (including on sensitive issues such as foreign ownership and domestic deregulation) and threatened discriminatory treatment against countries they believed were free-riding. But because most of the targeted states lacked firms that could benefit from access to the US market, and because the talks focussed only on individual sectors, it was uncertain that this strategy would have the desired effect. Traditional approaches to understanding bargaining outcomes provide only partial explanations for the results of US pressure during these negotiations. This article argues that the negotiations created a widely perceived linkage between improved offers from the developing countries and a credible signal to foreign investors regarding the attractiveness of that country's territory as a location for investment.

TI Can trade liberalization promote green production? Evidence from China's

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB Whether international trade causes environmental damage to developing countries has caused widespread concern. We estimate trade liberalization's impact on environmental performance using unique firm-level pollution data in China. By using maximum tariff rates from China's accession agreement as instrumental variables for actual tariff rates, we find that cuts in import tariffs enhance the average SO2 emission. Changes in the composition of products in the polluting and non-polluting industries can explain the substantial increase in the average SO2 emission. However, using multiple firm-level indicators, we demonstrate the existence of the trade-induced technique effect that trade liberalization can promote cleaner production.

TI Overcoming the "Solow paradox": Tariff reduction and productivity growth
   of Chinese ICT firms
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines the phenomenon of the "Solow paradox" in China using the Annual Survey of Industrial Production database and the China Customs Records dataset from 1998 to 2007. We find that China likely fell into the Solow paradox in the period 1998-2002, but the total factor productivity of information and communication technology (ICT) enterprises has achieved rapid growth since 2003. Accession to the World Trade Organization is the key reason for China to overcome the Solow paradox, that is, input tariff reduction significantly promoted the productivity of ICT firms. A series of validity and robustness checks confirmed the results. Mechanism analysis shows that input liberalization promotes the productivity of ICT firms through optimizing factor structure, importing more and high-quality inputs, and increasing research and development investment. The conclusions provide strong empirical evidence for developing countries to overcome the Solow paradox through trade liberalization.

AB Even though the international trade system has evolved without consideration of environmental protection frameworks, efforts are being made to join environmental and political aims. International Institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are committed to this task, as also are signatories of both North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and international environmental conventions adopted during the past ten years, The relationship between international trade and environment will become compulsory in Latin America's export policies during this decade. These developing countries base their development on increase of exports and will have to adopt environmental standards of well developed countries. In the context of their insertion in international markets, environmental topics have been ignored. This explains the lack of studies on the relationship between globalization and environment, the passive attitude towards setting and compiling international standards, and the absence of clear environmental policy profiles. The development of such profiles seems to be indispensable to keep Latin America within the process of global insertion, implying the consideration of legal and institutional realities, and also natural resources and environmental management. The search for consensus between trade and environment will predominate in the coming decade.

TI The Illegitimacy of Joint Statement Initiatives and Their Systemic
   Implications for the WTO
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The launch of 'Joint Statement Initiatives' (JSI) on electronic commerce, investment facilitation, and domestic regulation of services by groups of mainly developed country members in 2017 aimed to reinvigorate the World Trade Organization's negotiating arm. These plurilateral negotiations to produce new rules that might be applied on a most-favoured-nation basis have been justified with a pragmatic blend of political, ideological, and legal arguments. This strategy directly challenges the World Trade Organization's (WTO) core tenets of multilateralism, Member-driven consensus decision-making, and special and differential treatment, and sidelines the WTO's role to mandate negotiations and its established bodies. Developing countries have challenged the systemic implications of JSIs for their ability to advance their own priorities, as was promised when the WTO was established. This article shows why JSIs lack legal legitimacy and their adverse systemic implications with reference to the WTO's founding principles and its legal rules. It finds the justifications for JSIs rely on tenuous interpretations of WTO rules and the preferred mode of implementation involves a misuse of trade in services schedules. It warns that the precedent set by these JSIs would license future rule making by self-selecting groups of Members on a potentially limitless range of matters and deepen existing fissures within the troubled WTO.

AB 'Fairness and equality tend to be in the eye of the beholder, especially when commercial interests are at stake'
   This article focuses on the issue of enforcement of the WTO rules on international cross-border trade in services. It is argued that the examination of the GAYS jurisprudence and state practice reveal that the GATS does not address the needs of the developing countries in general and the prospects of Internet gambling services in the Caribbean Community in particular. First, the article discusses the extent of service-producing activities within the GATS provisions and outlines the main principles of WTO. It stresses that 'services' include gambling and games provided online. It also asserts that cross-border trade in services via Information and Communication Technologies presents several challenges for policy makers including enforcement, control and accountability. Second, the article critically analyses the United States (US) domestic legal instruments, which led to the complaint by Antigua and Barbuda. Subsequently, the focus is shifted to the critique of the judgments by WTO dispute settlement bodies. Third, the article evaluates the effectiveness of the DSU from a legal redress and compliance point of view; particularly in instances where weaker economies as complainants challenge leading economies of the world.

TI Selecting Partner Countries for Preferential Trade Agreements:
   Experimental Evidence From Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Vietnam
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
AB Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) constitute the most rapidly growing form of trade liberalization in the global economy. In contrast to, for example, the World Trade Organization, PTAs allow for discrimination among potential partner countries. This helps explain their proliferation. But it also raises an important question: which countries are preferred partners for PTAs? On the presumption that public opinion matters-both normatively and analytically-for trade policy, we study what types of countries citizens prefer for PTAs. We focus on developing countries, as they both play an increasingly important role in the expanding global network of PTAs and also remain understudied in the literature on international cooperation and trade policy. To account for the multidimensionality of PTA partner country choice, we develop and test a theoretical framework through conjoint experiments embedded in national surveys in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Vietnam. The results show that, despite starkly divergent national contexts, citizens in all three countries opt for similar partner countries. Respondents prefer culturally similar countries, democracies, and countries that maintain high environmental and labor standards. Somewhat surprisingly, economic size and geographic distance prove less important in the choice of which countries to support as PTA partners.

TI GSP+ and Human Rights: Is the EU's Approach the Right One?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Among the purposes of the EU's GSP+ programme is to link human rights to trade incentives, with the idea of using such incentives to promote developing countries' adoption of the values found in core human rights treaties. With the re-renewal of the GSP (and GSP+) programmes to take effect in January 2014, it is fruitful to examine their efficacy and consistency with WTO law. In this article, I argue the GSP+ programme is not only ineffective in obtaining an improvement in human rights conditions for the vast majority of the world's population, but it is also incompatible with WTO law. A stick-based regime where human rights abuses are linked to trade sanctions is a better way to proceed. After outlining the GSP+ system, and its linkage of human rights and trade, I analyse its efficacy and WTO consistency. Having shown that it is ineffective and contrary to WTO law, I argue that trade sanctions based on a PPM distinction and/or GATT XX(a) may be the appropriate means of linking trade and human rights. The article ends with some concluding remarks on the need for the careful design of such a system.

AB The emerging Global Administrative Law (GAL) study has brought into the legal frontlines the need to hold global governance bodies more accountable for their rulings and activities, and how these institutions are adapting their actions to better respond to new global challenges as their legitimacy depends on their effectiveness in coping with them. The legitimacy challenge has become a pressing issue, forcing international organizations to open up their decision-making processes and to set up review mechanisms to oversee their actions. The recent WTO Aid for Trade (AFT) Initiative belongs to this new category of global action/forums that want to respond to legitimacy and accountability challenges. This innovative movement has provided the WTO Director General with the responsibility to launch and institutionalize an initiative to allow poorer countries to derive more benefit from the Multilateral Trading System. It has brought together a wide range of stakeholders including international aid-donor states, beneficiary states, international financial and development institutions, regional banks and regional institutions, private sector, NGOs etc. to discuss and shape the best way to achieve this aim. This article tries to assess the AFT Initiative against the principles advocated by GAL, in particular those related to participation, transparency, accountability and review.

TI THE EUROPEAN TRIPS-PLUS MODEL AND THE ARAB WORLD: FROM CO-OPERATION TO
   ASSOCIATION-A NEW ERA IN THE GLOBAL IPRS REGIME?
SO LIVERPOOL LAW REVIEW
AB The advocation of stronger and higher levels of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) protection has been on the rise in recent years, particularly since the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995. Although its establishment signalled the beginning of a new phase in the protection of IPRs internationally, no more than a decade later, it is seen that such a regime is still undergoing a number of significant changes. In this regard, the rise of bilateralism and the retreat of multilateralism resulted in the so-called 'TRIPS-Plus' recipe in which developing countries are increasingly giving way to the demands of the industrialised countries through incorporating higher levels of IPRs protection domestically. Although the USA has often been viewed as the primary advocator and enforcer of the TRIPS-Plus recipe globally, this article shows that in fact the European Union (EU) advocated the TRIPS-Plus recipe long before the USA. Thus, this article discusses the case of the European TRIPS-Plus model with the Arab World as a clear demonstration of such a trend. Developing and Arab countries are now faced with two determined superpowers acting at both the unilateral and bilateral levels to achieve their desired higher standards of IPRs protection worldwide. This will further erode the flexibilities of the TRIPS Agreement, and will entail grave repercussions for both the developing and Arab countries.

TI Beyond Rules and Agreements: Reading the Tea Leaves
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB 'The even, uneven, and complex nature of the ground in the front or on the sides or in the rear should be examined.'
   In the rapidly evolving stage of world trade, India needs to redefine its role from one that reacts to events, to one that shapes the same. The challenges to this are many: India is currently facing a spate of disputes at the WTO; its status as a developing country entitled to special and differential treatment is being questioned by a few countries, and; the development agenda for WTO reform on issues ranging from services to agriculture set forth at the Doha Round in 2001, remains unfinished.
   Since the 11th Ministerial Conference in 2017, the format for negotiations at the WTO has also changed with the mushrooming of 'joint ministerial grounds'- which are informal groups dedicated to discussions on E-commerce, Investment Facilitation, Domestic Regulation in Services, and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). India has been sceptical about engaging with such issues, the concern being that when there is unfinished business under the WTO's Doha Agenda, Members cannot divert attention to new issues without a clear mandate.
   India needs to develop a clear strategy to address each of these challenges. This article discusses a few options that India could consider in reshaping its vision and role in the world of trade.

   the WTO
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Sustained high growth in many developing countries ('the rise of the rest') combined with long-standing World Trade Organization (WTO) working practices hamper the ability of the WTO to perform its routine functions and paralyze efforts to adapt to new circumstances. For want of an alternative, preferential trade agreements have taken up some of the slack in addressing differences in domestic regulation of product safety, environmental and social conditions, but these are exclusionary and inefficient from a global perspective. In this article, we argue that a new type of agreement based on open plurilateral cooperation offers better prospects for groups of countries to explore and develop their potential common interests on regulatory matters, while safeguarding core aspects of their national regulatory sovereignty and increasing the possibility of regenerating the WTO from within.

AB The Initiative of Aid for Trade, launched in 2005 during the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, aims to articulate a coherent strategy to support trade as an engine of growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. It has expanded both the conceptual scope of this type of interventions (going beyond the limits of the classic technical assistance) and the coverage of beneficiary countries (taking into account not only the least developed countries, but also the middle income countries -among them, the Latin American ones-). The goal of this article is to identify and analyze the main characteristics of the aid for trade flows in the case of 17 Latin American countries, assessing to what extent these characteristics adapt to the needs and priorities of recipient countries.

   Review Mechanism
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Relatively little is known about the economic effects of WTO members' communications outside of official negotiations and dispute proceedings. This paper considers whether interactions between members through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the WTO's prime transparency institution, lead to subsequent changes in bilateral trade flows. Trade policy concern submissions are more likely to lead to positive trade responses when (i) the receiving country is less concerned about terms-of-trade losses, (ii) the submitter is more willing to engage in WTO disputes with the reviewed member to challenge controversial trade policies, and (iii) the submitting country challenges trade policies in the nonchemical manufacturing sector. Nudges through the TPR process are not successful in raising agricultural trade.

TI Responsibilities of China after accession to the WTO
SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB China became a full member of the WTO on 11 December 2001. China has not only increased its presence in mainstream world trade but has gained knowledge about the basic rules of market economies and become more adaptable to changes in the international economy. As a new member of the WTO, being adaptable to changes in the international economy is essential. As a large developing country China, with its rapid economic growth, huge volume of trade and substantial market potential, has exerted and will continue to exert profound influence on the world economy. It is commonly recognized that China's influence cannot be ignored in the world economy. Five years since its accession to the WTO, China is considering where it stands as a member of the WTO. What does China hope to achieve by being a member of the WTO, how can these hopes be shared among all trading partners, what is China's responsibility in this, and what are the responsibilities of other trading partners?.

TI A pirate of the caribbean the attractions of suspending TRIPS
   obligations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB On 21 December 2007, arbitrators in the US Gambling dispute awarded the Caribbean Island State Antigua and Barbuda the right to retaliate against the United States of America by suspending obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights with an annual value of US 21 million. Given the asymmetries in market size and economic power, this scenario serves as the perfect case study for testing claims that suspending intellectual property protection is a legal and feasible option for developing countries and small economies in disputes with their larger trading partners. I argue that it can do a significantly better job than traditional retaliation in achieving the re-balancing purpose as well as the objective of inducing compliance. The relevant DSU rules further do not raise real hurdles for cross-retaliation. However, its main attraction lies in the potential to generate positive welfare effects: If implemented wisely, suspending TRIPS obligations can create temporary policy space for designing the domestic intellectual property regime in a way which facilitates technological development and domestic innovation through imitation and technological learning. In this case, the publicity WTO authorized piracy is likely to generate might actually put a spotlight on normative flaws within the global intellectual property regime.

TI Is increased agricultural protection beneficial for South Africa?
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB Using atop down computable general equilibrium microsimulation model Of South Africa, this paper explores the impact on household well being of an increase in agricultural protection. This issue is of broader relevance to developing countries that may be contemplating the use of World Trade Organisation permissible trade barriers so as to achieve a domestic policy objective. The model predicts that gross domestic product would be unaffected while real private consumption falls. The real exchange rate appreciates while unemployment levels are unaffected. Food, other manufactures, trade and hotels are the clear losers. All other industries experience small positive gains or no impact on their Output:. The impact on households depends on their factor endowments and their consumption patterns. The impacts on poverty reduction are very small. Poverty indicators increase more in urban areas than in rural areas. Poverty increases slightly more among Asian households, followed by White and then Coloured households, African households experience small declines in poverty. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI Trade Disputes and the Agriculture Policies in the Developing World:
   Time to Clawback the Development Space under the WTO
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Certain rulings relating to the Agreement on Agriculture have limited the development space available to developing countries, including India. At least two out of three 'pillars' of the Agreement which comprise of disciplines related to tariffication, agricultural market support and agricultural exports have been interpreted in a manner which would prohibit traditionally used measures such as quantitative restrictions at the border and minimum support price to farmers. This article will focus on disciplines on quantitative restrictions and the interpretation of the Panel and AB in Indonesia - Import Licensing Regimes which confirmed the ordinary meaning of Article 4.2. Further, it will analyse the rulings in Korea-Beef and China-Agricultural Producers which dramatically limit the agricultural support that can be provided by WTO members. Innovative arguments for development-friendly outcomes will be explored. However, as this article will demonstrate, such arguments will do little to address the systemic disadvantages that plague agricultural disciplines in developing countries today.

TI How to Conclude the Doha Development Agenda
SO EUROCHOICES
AB It is easier to launch a Round than to conclude it, and nice words won't do now. To save a trade negotiation which had already gotten off to a wrong start, and which has turned into a narrow lane focused on agriculture, is especially difficult when world trade is booming and only a few players can see benefits for themselves. Both a 'quick fix' and a 'beef round' are still possible, even though ambitious free-traders will regret such an outcome. A drawn-out pause, on the other hand, is a more likely yet not dramatic scenario. It could even be beneficial. Firstly, for re-tabling the so-called Singapore issues (investment, competition, government procurement). Secondly, for reflecting on other issues with increasing importance: new multilateral rules for production and processing methods and, more broadly, tackling societal values through trade-friendly methods such as labelling and international environmental and labour standards. Developing countries rightly fear a new face of protectionism behind such themes. But only a broad menu can lead to generally acceptable results. If it includes new issues the WTO can regain the lead in trade liberalisation. If it continues to ignore societal values, the multilateral trading system might be doomed.

TI Priorities of global justice (Poverty, moral philosophy)
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB One-third of all human deaths are due to poverty-related causes, to malnutrition and to diseases that can be prevented or cured cheaply. Yet our politicians, academics, and mass media show little concern for how such poverty might be reduced. They are more interested in possible military interventions to stop human rights violations in developing countries, even though such interventions at best produce smaller benefits at greater cost. This Western priority may be rooted in self-interest. But it engenders, and is sustained by, a deeply flawed moral presentation of global economic cooperation. The new global economic order we impose aggravates global inequality and reproduces severe poverty on a massive scale. On any plausible understanding of our moral values, the prevention of such poverty is our foremost responsibility.

TI Financial Sector Regulation and Financial Services Liberalization at the
   Crossroads: The Relevance of International Financial Standards in WTO
   Law
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB This article provides an assessment of the relevance in World Trade Organization (WTO) law of the international financial standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), international cooperation fora bringing together domestic financial regulators. This analysis gauges the potential use of these international financial standards in a potential future dispute settlement involving the domestic regulation of financial services. It demonstrates their relevance in WTO law as well as their both considerable and contested role in the institutional practice of the organization, thereby highlighting the incentives for regulatory harmonization that are embedded in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (CATS). The difficulties are mainly centred on the Basel Committee due to its limited membership, therefore not meeting the conditions of validity for the recognition of external standards laid down in the CATS, and also leading to the reluctance of some developing countries unwilling to endorse standards to which they have not previously agreed. More broadly, this study reflects on the potential tensions between plurilateral regulatory strategies and the multilateral context of the WTO and highlights the insufficient coordination between the international legal frameworks for the regulation and for the liberalization of financial services.

The simulation results show that the major gains from WTO accession would accrue to China itself, but the rest of the world, especially developed countries and Asian newly industrialized economies, as well as least developed countries, would also benefit due to the expansion of world trade and improvement of their international terms of trade. Only certain developing countries with an endowment structure similar to China, like those in South America and Southeast Asia, may experience keener competition in labor-intensive exports and lower prices for their products.

TI Trade and Equality: A Relationship to Discover
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB There is conspicuous inequality among World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries. WTO law has responded to this by creating a set of rules (Special and Differential Treatment or S&DT) which permit specially favorable trading treatment to support the participation of developing countries, even though equality of treatment is a central principle and objective of WTO law. Yet, it is widely agreed that S&DT has not succeeded in its aim of advancing trade equality. Insight into the reasons for this relative failure may be drawn from another body of international law which has equality as a core principle and objective and which also permits special treatment, human rights equality law. Analyzing commonly identified flaws in S&DT from the perspective of the theoretical, conceptual and strategic framework of human rights equality law enables the flaws to be understood more deeply. It also offers a new perspective on the impasse which has been reached in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and provides robust guidance as to how S&DT may be made stronger, more effective and more operational.

TI Regional Trade Agreements in the WTO System: Potential Issues and
   Solutions
SO JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB In the international trading system today, regional trade agreements, referring to reciprocal trade agreements between two or more countries providing exclusive trade preferences, govern not only the trade relations among the parties to the RTAs, but also form additional sets of trade disciplines. These agreements exist parallel to the multilateral trading system under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. The GATT/WTO rules authorize RTAs under certain conditions; thus on the surface, RTAs appear to be a legitimate part of the WTO system. However, in substance, the preferential terms of trade in RTAs are essentially in conflict with the most important principle of the WTO system, the most-favored-nation treatment. The current proliferation of RTAs thus makes exclusive RTA preferences, which are supposedly an exception to the MFN principle, a rule rather than an exception. This article examines GATT/WTO rules on RTAs, addresses the potential conflict between RTAs and the WTO system with potential solutions, and analyzes RTAs from the development perspective.

TI THE WTO AND ITS INSTITUTIONAL IMPEDIMENTS
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB The latest round of multilateral trade negotiations - the Doha Round - initiated a comprehensive negotiating round set out in a complex structure. At the same time, this Round focused attention on a 'development agenda', all as part of a 'single undertaking' with an ambitious three year deadline. The negotiations were troubled from the start and there are not many signs that agreement will be reached anytime soon. Given the long standing impasse, the time is now ripe to begin evaluating and understanding how the Doha Round negotiations became a seemingly endless charade and why the possibility of a substantial and workable agreement continues to elude WTO Members. This commentary attempts to address these questions by providing the background and timeline to the Doha Round before briefly discussing some of the differing negotiating positions and preferred outcomes of the major Members and negotiating coalitions. While the negotiating positions differ widely on a number of issues, this commentary concludes that more systemic institutional impediments exist, which not only hinder the successful conclusion of the Doha Round, but also prevent effective long-term institutional governance and vision.

TI Could the proposed WTO Special Safeguard Mechanism protect farmers from
   low international prices?
SO FOOD POLICY
AB This paper offers an empirical analysis of the proposal by some developing countries for an agricultural Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) in the World Trade Organization. It draws on political economy and market theory to demonstrate that the loss-averting domestic producer benefits that proponents believe the SSM would offer agricultural-importing developing countries may be illusory, insofar as agricultural-exporting countries also seek to avert producer losses. By way of illustration, the paper then uses time series data to analyze past government responses to fluctuations in the world's rice markets. The results suggest that the proposed SSM would deliver at most only a small fraction of the loss-averting benefits that have been advertised by the proponents of the SSM. Since the analysis applies to upward as well as downward spikes in international prices, it underscores the importance of strengthening multilateral disciplines on both import and export trade interventions to reduce beggar-thy-neighbor unilateral trade policy responses to food price fluctuations.

TI ENTRY OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SECTOR IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA INTO

SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE
AB Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) has an observer status in World Trade Organisation (WTO) with an expectation to become a member of this organisation under a developing country's status. B&H has experienced a large deficit in trade in agri-food products. Domestic agriculture and the food sector have experienced difficulties to cope with the increased competition at international and domestic markets. Under the deteriorating agri-food trade patterns, there are growing political pressures by agricultural interest groups against agricultural and food trade liberalisation. This causes conflict of interests in a strategy for completion of the negotiation process with WTO. As some countries in the region already successfully completed the entry into WTO (e.g. Croatia) or both the entry into WTO and into EU (e.g. Slovenia), we underline these two country experiences. The paper draws attention to opportunities in this B&H path to WTO on a way to EU membership.

AB Aid for trade(AFT) is an important part of normal Official Development Assistance, and mainly to help developing countries and regions, especially the least developed countries to improve production capability and the level of economic development. Since the implementation of AFT program in 2005, WTO, other international and regional organizations and many countries have paid more attention to this continent. WTO seems to be a bridge between the donors and recipients to improve the exchange of trade and the economic development. Africa is the second biggest continent in the world, but weak infrastructure, lack of hardware devices, and low production capacity restrict its economic development. Dose the implementation of AFT improve the living conditions and development level of African countries? The question needs further analysis.

TI Trumping Capacity Gap with Negotiation Strategies: the Mexican USMCA
   Negotiation Experience
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In the past few months, we have witnessed the 'worst deal' in the history of the USA become the 'best deal' in the history of the USA. The negotiation leading to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) appeared as an 'asymmetrical exchange' scenario that could have led to an unbalanced outcome for Mexico. However, Mexico stood firm on its positions and negotiated a modernized version of North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico faced various challenges during this renegotiation, not only because it was required to negotiate with two developed countries but also due to the high level of ambition and demands raised by the new US administration. This paper provides an account of these impediments. More importantly, it analyzes the strategies that Mexico used to overcome the resource constraints it faced amidst the unpredictable political dilemma in the US and at home. In this manner, this paper seeks to provide a blueprint of strategies that other developing countries could employ to overcome their negotiation capacity constraints, especially when they are dealing with developed countries and in uncertain political environments.

TI Coherence and the WTO
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB Coherence between the WTO and the Bretton Woods Institutions (a formal WTO objective) has achieved some minor goals but has been expensive in terms of direct costs and inefficiencies in policy-making and policy debate. The so-called Integrated Framework has achieved relatively little and aid for trade has yet to be fully established. There is little role for the WTO in development and aid policy other than its traditional job of facilitating trade growth, and so its role in aid-for-trade is unclear. Coherence, especially when interpreted as allowing developing countries to avoid trade liberalization in the name of development, has confused and weakened the Doha Round of WTO negotiations.

TI Driving a decade of change: HIV/AIDS, patents and access to medicines
   for all
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY
AB Since 2000, access to antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV infection has dramatically increased to reach more than five million people in developing countries. Essential to this achievement was the dramatic reduction in antiretroviral prices, a result of global political mobilization that cleared the way for competitive production of generic versions of widely patented medicines.
   Global trade rules agreed upon in 1994 required many developing countries to begin offering patents on medicines for the first time. Government and civil society reaction to expected increases in drug prices precipitated a series of events challenging these rules, culminating in the 2001 World Trade Organization's Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health. The Declaration affirmed that patent rules should be interpreted and implemented to protect public health and to promote access to medicines for all. Since Doha, more than 60 low- and middle-income countries have procured generic versions of patented medicines on a large scale.
   Despite these changes, however, a "treatment timebomb" awaits. First, increasing numbers of people need access to newer antiretrovirals, but treatment costs are rising since new ARVs are likely to be more widely patented in developing countries. Second, policy space to produce or import generic versions of patented medicines is shrinking in some developing countries. Third, funding for medicines is falling far short of needs. Expanded use of the existing flexibilities in patent law and new models to address the second wave of the access to medicines crisis are required.
   One promising new mechanism is the UNITAID-supported Medicines Patent Pool, which seeks to facilitate access to patents to enable competitive generic medicines production and the development of improved products. Such innovative approaches are possible today due to the previous decade of AIDS activism. However, the Pool is just one of a broad set of policies needed to ensure access to medicines for all; other key measures include sufficient and reliable financing, research and development of new products targeted for use in resource-poor settings, and use of patent law flexibilities. Governments must live up to their obligations to protect access to medicines as a fundamental component of the human right to health.

TI Trade in Generics v. World-Scale Market Segmentation: Market-Driven
   Solutions to the 'Paragraph 6' Issue
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB WTO Members are involved in an open re-regulatory process to facilitate pro-health pharmaceutical policies in the developing world since the launch of the Doha Development Round and its historical Declaration on public health and access to medicines (2001). However, solutions such as its member-driven mechanism of the 2003 Decision (designed to facilitate access to generics in countries that lack manufacturing capacity) are basically ineffective. Alternatively, market-driven multilateral solutions are to be explored. The multilateral trading system could make a critical contribution to facilitate access to affordable generic medicines in developing countries by concentrating on what it does best, namely promoting global trade in generics, and thus generics market formation on a global scale.

TI The Role of Law in Economic Development Process within the Context of
   the Islamic World: De-linking Oil and Gas Projects and Re-linking
   International Legal Reform
SO MANCHESTER JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In many Islamic countries, it appears that outside of oil and gas projects and a few specific infrastructure projects, far-less real economic development has taking place than would have been expected. This is considering the immense endowment of both natural and human resources in the region. Focusing on the stable oil-rich (Gulf) Arab States, the paper examines the role of Law and the formal legal system in the economic development process. It argues that weaknesses in Gulf State legal systems distort the ability of these States to diversify their economies beyond oil and gas and there is the need for international legal-reform in these States, but also the reform should be pursued to serve the needs of the local people. The paper uses the structural-functional legal theoretical approach, interdisciplinary and critical-analytical perspective within the framework of international law and development. It employs qualitative empirical evidence from developed and developing countries.

TI Imperfect adaptation: how the WTO and the IMF adjust to shifting power
   distributions among their members
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB How do international institutions adjust to shifting power distributions among their members? We argue that institutional adaptations to the rise of emerging and the decline of established powers are different from what power transition theories (PTTs) would lead us to believe. Institutional adaptations are not impossible, as pessimist PTT variants hold; and they are rarely easy to attain, let alone perfect, as optimist PTT variants imply. To bridge the gap between these versions of PTT, we propose an institutionalist power shift theory (IPST) which combines insights on the conditions and mechanisms of institutional change from functionalist, historical and distributive variants of rational institutionalism. IPST claims that institutional adaptations will succeed or fail depending on whether or not emerging powers are able to undermine the international institution and to make credible threats to this effect. To demonstrate IPST's plausibility we analyze: (1) how India and Brazil gained the agreement of established powers to their membership in the WTO core negotiation group (BQuad<^>), which had previously been dominated by developed countries; and (2) how China reached agreement with established powers on (more) even-handed surveillance of IMF members' financial stability, which, up to then, had focused on developing countries and exchange rate issues.

TI WTO-plus commitments and emerging implications for China's large civil
   aircraft manufacturing
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB China's accession to the WTO in 2001 is widely accepted as a landmark event for the multilateral trade system and for the country. The large-scale WTO-plus commitments have nevertheless received unceasing criticism and discussion. This article is concerned with the resulting policy implications for the Chinese initiative to become a global producer of large civil aircraft at the next stage of development. A real-life case study is expected to provide robust evidence for inquiring whether China and emerging economies alike can smoothly advance up the global value chain while honouring their WTO obligations in good faith. The article confirms the widespread opinion that there are vast legal uncertainties ahead for China throughout this journey, and for that reason, a rigorous market-orientation effort is needed to strengthen its ability to compete in the commercial aviation sector.

   Countries: Evidence from India
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB In 2005, as the result of a World Trade Organization mandate, India implemented a patent reform for pharmaceuticals that was intended to comply with the 1995 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Exploiting variation in the timing of patent decisions, we estimate that a molecule receiving a patent experienced an average price increase of just 3-6 percent, with larger increases for more recently developed molecules and for those produced by just one firm when the patent system began. Our results also show little impact on quantities sold or on the number of pharmaceutical firms operating in the market.

TI International trade and labour: a quest for moral legitimacy
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically review the arguments for and against a social clause as an ethical benchmark for international trade.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes a social economic approach in analysing the case for and against a social clause in international trade. It considers an economic, jurisprudential, social and human rights case for a social clause.
   Findings - The consideration of a social clause purely in economic terms, removed from its social context fundamentally flaws the arguments on both sides of the debate. The conclusion of south-south labour agreements, north-south bilateral free-trade agreements and regional integration schemes incorporating labour standards has a positive impact on diffusing tension and helping in consensus building around the issue. Labour standards are human rights and to claim comparative advantage in human rights in trade is unethical. There is a need to keep the debate alive especially within the World Trade Organization.
   Practical implications - The paper provides an insight into the utility of a social clause in the trade and development agenda for both developed and developing countries.
   Originality/value - Given the strength of emotions surrounding the issue, the proposed approach will assist in detoxing the debate and in providing an avenue for vertical and horizontal consensus building on the issue.

TI Better Off Out? The Costs and Benefits of Sub-Saharan Africa's
   Membership of the World Trade Organization
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB Originally conceived as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948, the World Trade Organization (WTO) needs no introduction. It is a full-fledged custodian of the multilateral trading system since January 1, 1995, which succeeded GATT with a view to extending the mandate to an organization that was in need of reform. With the accession of China and nine other members from 1999-2001, the WTO now covers 97% of the world's population, having added another 1.5 billion people to its fold. This increase in membership in recent years has been entirely made up of developing countries and countries in transition-defined by the WTO to include the former Soviet Union, eastern and central Europe, the Baltic States, and the Balkans.
   This paper reviews three central pillars of the WTO's structure and rules-all important areas relevant to the question of how developing countries can derive greater benefits from participation in the multilateral trading system. First, the nature of WTO rules; second, the reach of these rules; and third, the conditions of market access, that collectively determine the quality and utility of the WTO for its members. Not surprisingly, each of these three elements features prominently in the Doha Development Agenda. I choose to use this three-pronged approach to outline the arguments for and against sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) membership of the WTO by assessing the real or perceived costs and benefits of membership.
   Overall, the paper suggests that SSA states are perhaps better off out-at least for the simple reason of the unfair and/or "rigged" rules that govern such trade under the WTO framework. Considering the slow pace of reform at the WTO and the continued stalling of WTO summits from Seattle, through Cancun to the ever-evolving Doha Rounds of negotiations, a further suggestion leads to a rejection of the idea that a departure from the WTO would have horrific consequences, tantamount to economic suicide for SSA.
   On a cautionary note, however, the author recognizes that in practice, it is difficult to tell whether SSA would be better or worse leaving the WTO, but the contention suggests that other alternatives-such as a reinvigorated south-south co-operation and SSA regional trading arrangements-would most certainly benefit SSA.

TI Intellectual Property-Related Local Content Requirements in
   International Trade Law: An Evolving Concept Amid Persisting Questions
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Despite the challenges they pose under international trade law, recent discussions and cases at the World Trade Organization (WTO) demonstrate that local content requirements (LCRs) have enjoyed continued success among both developed and developing countries. This article focuses on a specific type of LCRs, intellectual property-related LCRs (IP-related LCRs). The article argues that the concept and related regulation of LCRs concerning IP rights have undergone a remarkable evolution under international trade law. The notion and regulation of IP-related LCRs, in particular, have changed from the 1883 Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention) and the 1886 Berne Convention on the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne Convention) to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1947 and, later, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and other Agreements at the WTO. Indeed, while the Paris Convention and the Berne Convention are still in force, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1947 and the WTO Agreements have reframed the debate and implications of IP-related LCRs. Nevertheless, some questions on what is permissible under international trade law remain open at the WTO. Given LCRs continued success, some clarifications on their consistency with WTO law may be further needed.

TI Validating the innovation prowess framework for firms in emerging
   economies facing tight regulatory regimes: the case of Indian
   pharmaceutical firms
SO JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING
AB The purpose is to investigate the generalizability of an innovation prowess framework, developed for firms in developed countries, for firms in emerging economies facing tight regulatory regimes. Using a qualitative approach we investigate key informants in six firms, supported by secondary documents and the business press, as well as in-depth organizational observation within one organization. Academic evidence suggests there are four factors - one external (industry structure) and three internal (economic structure of the firm, organizational structure of the firm, and historical development of the firm) - that drive the innovation prowess of firms. While firms in developed economies take such factors as the norm, firms in developing countries face evolving norms and internal challenges to comply with tighter regulatory regimes; however, the research suggests that impact of these four factors appear to be similar to those faced by firms in developed countries. Our research contributes by seeking to broaden our understanding of innovation prowess in emerging country contexts. Innovation in these markets is generally less well understood, especially as they adapt to the tighter regulatory regimes required to compete in global markets (e.g. WTO).

TI Tariff Aggregation and Market Access: An Empirical Assessment for Canada
   and the EU
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D
   AGROECONOMIE
AB We use two alternative approaches to analyze the trade restrictiveness of the Canadian and EU import tariff structures for agricultural goods. The first involves direct, detailed calculations at the tariff line level of summary protection indexes. We compare the newer method of welfare and import equivalent indexes to the standard trade weighted method of aggregation. The second approach involves indirect index calculations, where we map tariff data into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, and then use the model to generate the summary. Each approach has its advantages. The direct tariff line approach reflects sector detail more comprehensively, but misses the sector and regional linkages captured by the CGE model. As an empirical illustration we simulate the impact of market access liberalization proposed in the WTO draft modality paper of February 2008. Pursuant to a tiered formula, we reduce bound and applied tariffs at the 6-digit tariff line level. We find that the direct tariff line approach and the hybrid tariff line CGE approach yield similar results. These indicate that access to Canada's agricultural sector is particularly restricted for milk imports from high-income countries. In contrast, developing countries have particular difficulty accessing the EU's Single Market, where high trade restrictions on beef, sugar, and rice are most relevant.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Within the present multilateral trading system, the developing countries are obliged to gradually open up their agricultural sector to world markets. As a result of this, the effectiveness of conventional instruments of food price stabilisation will be greatly reduced. How then is food price stability to be maintained in a liberalised open economy? This article presents a general-equilibrium evaluation of using variable trade levies on agricultural trade to stabilise foodgrain prices in response to exogenous shocks. This is clone for the Indian economy with the help of a multi-period computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, focused on agriculture non income distribution. The model distribution and food security to external and internal shocks under varying degrees of trade openness. The results show that both shocks are distributionally regressive and, with external shocks, become more so, the more open the economy is. WTO-consistent variable levies on agricultural trade are found effective in stabilising prices, checking real wage erosion and containing regressive distributional effects.

TI The pharmaceutical industry as a medicines provider
SO LANCET
AB Rising prices of medicines are putting them beyond the reach of many people, even in rich countries. In less-developed countries, millions of individuals do not have access to essential drugs. Drug development is failing to address the major health needs of these countries. The prices of patented medicines usually far exceed the marginal costs of their production; the industry maintains that high prices and patent protection are necessary to compensate for high development costs of innovative products. There is controversy over these claims. Concerns about the harmful effects of the international system of intellectual property rights have led the World Trade Organization to relax the demands placed on least developed countries, and to advocate differential pricing of essential drugs. How these actions will help countries that lack domestic production capacity is unclear. Better access to essential drugs may be achieved through voluntary licensing arrangements between international pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers in developing countries.

TI WTO DOHA ROUND: IMPLICATIONS FOR US AGRICULTURE
SO EFFECTS OF LIBERALIZING WORLD AGRICULTURAL TRADE
SE Agriculture Issues and Policies
AB The World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial conference, held in Geneva from July 21 to July 29, 2008, failed in its attempt to resolve the remaining outstanding issues in the Doha Round negotiations. Prior to the collapse of talks, negotiators had neared agreement on a "modalities framework" - specific formulas and timetables for reducing trade-distorting farm support, tariffs, and export subsidies - that would significantly lower allowable spending limits for certain types of U.S. domestic support, eliminate export subsidies, and allow U.S. agricultural products wider access in foreign markets. According to the latest draft of modalities and the current market outlook, U.S. domestic farm program outlays would appear to fit within proposed tighter limits without substantial modification. However, U.S. trade officials had expressed concern that proposed modalities included too many exceptions for foreign importers to ensure an adequate balance between U.S. domestic policy concessions and potential export gains. The issue on which the Ministerial eventually foundered was a proposed Special Safeguard Mechanism (S SM) that would allow developing countries like India and China to impose tariffs higher than negotiated tariff rates (bound rates) if imports surged. Absent an agreement on the SSM, the trade negotiations collapsed. Whether or when Doha Round negotiations would continue is uncertain.
   This chapter reviews the current status of agricultural negotiations for domestic support, market access, and export subsidies, and their potential implications for U.S. agriculture.

TI Will the Trade Facilitation Agreement's Novel Architecture and
   Flexibilities Have Unforeseen Consequences? An Analysis in the Context
   of World Trade Organization Accessions
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB When finalizing the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), World Trade Organization (WTO) Members introduced a highly novel architecture by allowing developing countries to self-designate their transition periods and to make their implementation conditional on the provision of technical assistance. The WTO contains certain rules and conventions of horizontal application and it is unclear how this will interact with the TFA's novel architecture, especially for special and differential treatment (S&DT). For example, in the context of accessions, the WTO takes a strict approach to S&DT. Acceding countries are often pressed to implement WTO commitments during accession negotiations. There is a general presumption against transition periods and, where acceding countries insist on access to transition periods, these have to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. This convention in accession negotiations runs contrary to the highly-permissive approach to transition periods in the TFA. It thus raises the question of how the WTO should deal with S&DT and transition periods for TFA commitments in developing country accessions. This article will explore several options and conclude that WTO accessions should replicate the TFA's permissive approach (with some minor amendments).

TI Compulsory Licensing in Canada and Thailand: Comparing Regimes to Ensure

SO JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS
AB This paper examines two recent examples of compulsory licensing legislation: one globally embraced regime and one internationally controversial regime operating under the same WTO rules. In particular, we consider Canadian legislation and the use of compulsory licensing for HIV/AIDS drugs destined for a developing country. This is then contrasted with the conditions under which Thai authorities are pursuing compulsory licenses, the outcomes of their compulsory licenses, as well as the likely impact of the Thai policy. Finally, we construct a rubric to evaluate characteristics of a successful regime. This is used to analyze the Canadian and Thai regimes and frame the expected implications of each national policy. It is hoped that the assessment will guide changes to compulsory licensing design to ensure that legitimate regimes are embraced while illegitimate ones are disallowed.

TI An Assessment of Agricultural Export Competitiveness of Commercial
   Crops: Pathways to Augment Indian Agricultural Exports
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Agricultural exports in developing countries significantly impact achieving sustainable development goals targeted at improving agricultural productivity, sustainability, poverty eradication, and employment creation. The pattern of agricultural export competitiveness of India vis-a-vis other Asian agricultural-based countries was assessed during the post-WTO period (2001 to 2019). The Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA) technique was employed using time series data focusing on High-Value Commercial (HVC) crops. As is evident from the RSCA indices for India, a high degree of export competitiveness was witnessed in tobacco, cotton, and spices, whereas it declined in sugarcane, coffee, and tea over the years. The commodities that exhibited strong competitiveness reflected huge potential, whereas commodities such as sugarcane, coffee, and tea experienced erosion in their competitiveness. With the changing priorities of the nation, there is a need for India to redraw future agricultural export scenarios focusing on the production of HVC crops, processing and value chains, and diversification of export baskets while maintaining the sustainability of agro-ecological assets. Nevertheless, agricultural exports had vast potential to drive the economy in developing countries like India. The holistic conclusion advocates an important policy implication for the design of export strategy to augment the export competitiveness of HVC crops and enhance the share of agricultural exports in the context of emerging trends and change commercial facets of Indian agriculture.

TI Transnational mercantilism and the emergent global trading order
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB It is often argued that the problems currently facing the World Trade Organization stem from an important shift in the trade agenda from tariff reduction to the harmonisation of domestic regulations considered as non tariff barriers. From this perspective, the lack of harmonisation of domestic regulations severely impairs the capacity of the WTO to fulfil its mission. This article argues, in contrast, that the underlying problems facing the contemporary trade agenda are different, and are caused by a lack of differentiation in the regulatory framework of the WTO. To substantiate this claim, a conception of transnational mercantilism is derived from recent scholarly revisions of classical mercantilism. This clarifies a continuity between the external dimension and the comprehensive pattern of social organisation involved in the political economy of international trade. This framework is used to appraise four structures upon which trade policy is predicated: the implementation of market mechanisms, the embeddedness of trade in state-society relations, the link between trade and the natural environment, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.

TI The Use of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement
   and Public Health (2001): A Review of Implementation Experiences in the
   Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT & TRADE
AB Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (2001) recognized the difficulty of some WTO member states in using the compulsory licensing flexibility allowed in the TRIPS Agreement due to their lack of local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities. However, there has been almost no implementation by countries of the subsequent WTO General Council decision of 30th August, 2003 which was designed to resolve this Paragraph 6 issue. This is due to the existence of various impediments - generally in the form of external and internal barriers. A comparative analysis is undertaken of the implementation of the Council Decision in two countries with varying levels of development and with different obligations with regards to enforcement of the TRIPS Agreement. It is shown that external barriers such as proliferation of bilateral agreements have more impeding effect on developing countries such as South Africa which are already part of the full TRIPS compliance regime. Conversely, internal barriers such as institutional and structural drawbacks have more of an impact in Least Developing Countries (LDCs) such as Bangladesh which have been given a transition period for TRIPS compliance and are not yet fully susceptible to external pressures of the international trade regime. The increased preference of countries to use alternative innovative mechanisms such as the Medicines Patent Pool to improve access to medicine outside the framework of the global IP/Trade regime reiterates the unworkability of the Council Decision in promoting access to medicines.

Zidovudine (AZT) is such a drug that is too expensive for many to afford. Most attempts to break the monopoly of the AZT-manufacturer Glaxo-Wellcome have failed. One exception is the Indian company Cipla. However, the circumstances that made the exception possible will likely cease to exist when the patent rules for members of the Would Trade Organization (WTO) fully enter into force.

The simulation results show that both China and Taiwan will substantially benefit from their WTO memberships, and their economic interdependence and their dependence within the rest of the world will further deepen. The rest of the world may also benefit because of the expansion of world trade and improvement of their international terms of trade, but some developing countries with an endowment structure similar to China, like those in South America and Southeast Asia, may experience keener competition in labour-intensive exports and lower prices for their products.

Using a large panel of Chinese manufacturing firms, we demonstrate that capital import has a substantially larger productivity effect than intermediates import. On the one hand, while both types of imports exert immediate effects on productivity, only capital import has dynamic productivity effects. On the other hand, we identify significant R&D-capital synergy effect and R&D-inducing effect from capital import, but there is no clear evidence of these effects from intermediates import. Regarding the effects of China's input tariff liberalization following its WTO accession, the change in tariff structure explains 18 percent of the productivity gains.

SO REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB We analyze policy options during an international health emergency to provide consumers in least developed countries access to patented life-extending pharmaceuticals. Reliance on property rights exhaustion is shown to be insufficiently flexible and costly to implement. By contrast, the optimal degree of price discrimination can always be achieved with a properly specified tariff. We identify a trade-off between patent length and the relevant optimal tariff rate. If the patent length is too short (too long) there must be an offsetting higher (lower) than socially optimal tariff rate. When patent length can be manipulated as an explicit policy tool we identify a clear policy assignment. The tariff rate should be set to achieve social welfare objectives while the patent length can be used to control the resource cost of innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the framework of GVCs'decomposition, we establish a hierarchical linear model (HLM) withthe data from 2007 to 2017 in the ADB MIRO, WTO BaTiS and WITS databases to analyze the impact of producer services imports in RCEP economies on the value-added domestic exports of manufacturing in countries around the world, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) Producer service imports have a significant positive impact on the domestic value-added of manufacturing exports through direct effects, upstream effects and downstream effects. The downstream effect is the main driving force for the improvement of manufacturing. After using instrumental variables to resolve endogeneity, the conclusion remains stable; (2) The downstream effect of insurance imports is the largest among producer services imports. After the outbreak of the world financial crisis, the transmission effect of the industry chain was higher in 2008 than before the crisis. (3) Due to the high degree of specialization of industrial division in developed economies, the transfer effect of the three major industrial chains is greater than that of developing countries and regions.

AB Both China and India are developing countries in the pharmaceutical industry, and both need to seek a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and satisfying people's healthcare needs. They also need to promote innovation and encourage the development of domestic industries. As members of the WTO, China and India have made a series of amendments to their respective intellectual property systems to live up to the TRIPS Agreement's minimum standards of protection, including recognition of pharmaceutical product patents, introduction of a compulsory licensing system, and Bolar exception. In promoting the development of its domestic pharmaceutical industry, India's experience in legislation and judicial practice deserves serious attention from China, such as using TRIPS's flexibility to facilitate access to medicines, implementing compulsory licensing to create more chances for voluntary licensing negotiation, and updating the guidelines for examining pharmaceutical applications to prevent ever-greening of pharmaceutical patents. Meanwhile, learning from India, China should start to provide its legal professionals with knowledge of global rules, to better further Chinese interests in the world arena.

The author assesses the degree of BRIGS cooperation in G20, IMF, the World Bank, WTO, UN and in climate negotiations. The BRICS countries are increasingly coordinating themselves and together have significant influence over a number of international processes and institutions, although primarily as a blocking minority. The countries are primarily united by what they are against Western dominance and obstacles to economic growth in developing countries. They often have different interests in individual cases, but still they are already a reality as a group of countries together wielding significant power in global politics and seem set to consolidate further.

TI Quantifiable impact on poverty in Trinidad and Tobago of the Uruguay
   round agreement on agriculture
SO FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB Background. The agreement on agriculture and the World Trade Organization were major outcomes of the 1986-1994 Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The measures under the UR were predicted to increase poverty in developing countries, a serious cause for concern since poverty alleviation is a major goal of developing countries. Thus this paper simulated the impact on poverty of the UR for a net food importing country, Trinidad and Tobago.
   Objective. The objectives of the study were to determine the changes in poverty levels in Trinidad and Tobago that we expected would result from changes in the price levels of food commodities after the removal of trade protection following the UR, and to examine recent trends in poverty in Trinidad and Tobago and the prices of major agricultural exports from the United States, its principal trading partner.
   Methods. A regression model (poverty model) was used to determine the relationship between poverty levels and the prices of sensitive imported food commodities (SIFCs) and other key economic variables. Impact models were used to project changes in world market prices of the SIFCs due to the UR, and these price changes were used to predict changes in poverty in Trinidad and Tobago.
   Results. The results showed a positive elasticity between poverty and the prices of SIFCs. The study also predicted that the average projected increase in price levels of the SIFCs of less than 9% by the year 2000 would cause an increase in poverty in Trinidad and Tobago of less than 4%.
   Conclusions. There has been, in fact, a small decline in poverty in Trinidad and Tobago since 1996. The prices of major agricultural exports from the United States have also been falling since 1995. Thus, so far the UR has had no perceptible effects in increasing the prices of food exports from the United States. Also, so far the UR has had no perceptible effect on the poverty level in Trinidad and Tobago.

TI China's Path to the Center Stage of WTO Dispute Settlement: Challenges
   and Responses
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB In 2009, China stood at the center stage of the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement, accounting alone for half of new disputes. From three perspectives, this article examines China's endeavors since WTO accession to respond challenges and support its meaningful participation in WTO dispute settlement. On ideological level, the prevailing attitude toward WTO dispute settlement in China remains legalistic and positive, but this article observes that pragmatism is rising and may lead to inconsistencies of China's behavior in the future. Concerning institution and capacity building, China is currently equipped with initially fledging internal mechanisms, growing in-house legal capacities and expanding societal supports, and has swelling potentials to compete with its fellow WTO members. However, outside legal expertise is still needed. On the issue of government and industry interaction, China has established a formal mechanism, but its utility has not yet been proven, with only one unsatisfactory instance suggesting reform is needed, not just more time. This article argues that China will likely continue to be a leading actor in WTO dispute settlement and suggests that developing country members might benefit from a consideration of China's experience.

TI IPR Laws to Protect Innovation not Restrict Crop Breeding - A Rational
   Approach
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
AB Private plant breeding has speeded up the introduction of new varieties and hybrids to improve productivity and production. Different intellectual property (IP) laws are in place to protect the innovation created in this sector. The relevant rights providing protection in this area include plant breeder's rights (PBRs) and patent rights. A peculiar exemption in plant breeding called 'breeder's exemption' in PBRs has been observed to play a vital role in innovation, an effect which was not seen as a result of the existing patent laws.
   The attention towards intellectual property rights in biological sciences and in particular, agricultural crops increased after TRIPS Agreement under WTO and each country enacted laws to protect the rights of innovators in crop breeding. Different forms of patent laws were already in place for protecting both processes and products in biological sciences in developed countries. But in most of the developing countries, these were available only for certain innovations. The complexity of biological systems and the available laws for protection of innovations are presently resulting in a lot of litigations among innovators in most of the countries. Broad patents granted in many crops for certain traits and also for essential breeding processes are resulting in apparent restriction of further research. A rational approach to protect innovation without restricting research has been put forth and discussed in this paper.

SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB What affects a country's decision of whether to formally engage in a trade dispute directly related to its exporting interests? This article empirically examines determinants of affected country participation decisions in formal trade litigation arising under the World Trade Organization (wto) between 1995 and 2000. It investigates determinants of nonparticipation and examines whether the incentives generated by the system's rules and procedures discourage active engagement in dispute settlement by developing country members in particular. Though the size of exports at stake is found to be an important economic determinant affecting the decision to participate in challenges to a wto-inconsistent policy, the evidence also shows that measures of a country's retaliatory and legal capacity as well as its international political economy relationships matter. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of an implicit "institutional bias" generated by the system's rules and incentives that particularly affects developing economy participation in dispute settlement.

TI Is China's domestic agricultural market influenced by price fluctuations
   of the world agricultural commodities in the short-run?
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
AB After entry into the WTO, China's domestic agricultural market is more and more closely integrated into the world market. Recently, a significant price fluctuation of agricultural commodities in the global market has increased concerns over its impact on the economic stability in those developing countries such as China, which has a large import and export of agricultural commodities every year. This paper attempts to study the short-term impact from price fluctuations of the world agricultural commodities upon the China's domestic agricultural market by investigating the dynamic correlation between the price change in the world and Chinese market in the copula framework. Our findings suggest a weak but strengthening short-run impact with an asymmetric nature. At the same time, diversified short-run impacts are observed in four main agricultural commodity markets. Empirical results show that the world price fluctuation has a volatile but decreasing influence on the China's rice market. This volatility of price impact is also observed in the wheat market but it has an escalating trend. The corn market experiences an intensified price shock with a distinct stage characteristic and the soybean market is under the strongest influence from the international price fluctuation.

TI The make or buy debate: Considering the limitations of domestic
   production in Tanzania
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: In order to ensure their population's regular access to essential medicines, many least developed countries and developing countries are faced with the policy question of whether to import or manufacture drugs locally, in particular for life-saving antiretroviral medicines for HIV/AIDS patients. In order for domestic manufacturing to be viable and cost-effective, the local industry must be able to compete with international suppliers of medicines by producing sufficiently low cost ARVs.
   Methods: This paper considers the 'make-or-buy' dilemma by using Tanzania as a case study. Key informant interviews, event-driven observation, and purposive sampling of documents were used to evaluate the case study. The case study focused on Tanzania's imitation technology transfer agreement to locally manufacture a first-line ARV (3TC + d4T + NVP), reverse engineering the ARV.
   Results: Tanzania is limited by weak political support for the use of TRIPS flexibilities, limited production capacity for ARVs and limited competitiveness in both domestic and regional markets. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare encourages the use of flexibilities while others push for increased IP protection. Insufficient production capacity and lack of access to donor-financed tenders make it difficult to obtain economies of scale and provide competitive prices.
   Conclusions: Within the "make-or-buy" context, it was determined that there are significant limitations in domestic manufacturing for developing countries. The case study highlights the difficulty of governments to make use of economies of scale and produce low-cost medicines, attract technology transfer, and utilize the flexibilities of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The results demonstrate the importance of evaluating barriers to the use of TRIPS flexibilities and long-term planning across sectors in future technology transfer and manufacturing initiatives.

TI AFTER BALI: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WITH ASIAN TRADE FACILITATION?
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB The 2013 Bali agreement on trade facilitation was hailed as a breakthrough. It represented the first time the World Trade Organization members successfully concluded negotiating a multilateral trade agreement among its members. But there is a lack of understanding of what is contained within the agreement among many of the individuals commenting on the deal, as well as across many of the member state officials charged with implementation. This paper explores the content of the agreement and then considers how Bali will actually alter the situation of trade facilitation on the ground. At this time, it is difficult to predict what Bali might mean for companies, because the agreement itself has so many flexibilities. Since every WTO member could potentially implement the deal differently, it will be hard to know precisely how countries or companies might benefit, especially for goods crossing into developing countries - thus leading to ongoing, challenging conditions for some time to come.

The WTO preamble recognises that the relations between member states in the field of trade and economic development should be conducted with a view to "raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services." In this endeavour, it is acknowledged that states should allow for the "optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development." Beyond such an acknowledgement in the Preamble, the WTO and its covered agreements have largely ignored sustainable development as a binding obligation on the member states. It was perceived that such binding commitments were unnecessary as the WTO's focus is trade governance. Besides, the developing countries were genuinely concerned that any substantive obligation on sustainable development, specifically in the context of environment and labour standards, shall have an adverse impact on their competitiveness vis-a-vis developed countries goods and services. More importantly, the prospective sustainable development measures may have a strong likelihood of being misused as a protectionist tool for trade gains by advanced economies that have already attained higher standard production and process methods and livelihood standards. These concerns and oppositions have left the "sustainability" objective in the WTO much to be desired. This chapter is an attempt to understand the interlinkages and conflicts in the context of the legal foundation of "sustainable development" in the WTO architecture, an organisation created to administer trade rules. The chapter shall look specifically at the approach taken by the WTO panel and the Appellate Body in interpreting and developing the concept. Special attention shall be given to the concerns of developing countries that have all along opposed inclusion of the sustainability concept without elaborate negotiation and consensus.

TI New Powers and the Distribution of Preferences in Global Trade
   Governance: From Deadlock and Drift to Fragmentation
SO NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Existing theories make divergent predictions about the impact of new powers on the global political economy. Some argue that a more even distribution of power will erode international cooperation, while others argue that cooperation can continue with the help of international institutions to overcome collective action problems. We argue that this debate overlooks a critical determinant of the shape of power transitions: the distribution of preferences amongst the major powers. It is primarily in the context of divergent preferences that power transitions are likely to give rise to conflict. Moreover, even where preferences diverge, the gains of cooperation provide a strong incentive to continue to pursue goals through multilateralism. This situation leads to forms of institutional change unanticipated by established theories. These include deadlock in expansive multilateral fora, institutional drift as old rules cannot keep up with the changing political and economic context, and fragmentation as countries seek minilateral solutions that reduce preference diversity. We develop this preference-based, institutional argument by examining the distribution of preferences and institutional change at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its Doha Round, where the power transition is relatively advanced.

TI Mini-symposium on developing countries in the Doha Round - Introduction
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In July 2004, the annual conference on Preparing the Doha Development Round: V 70 Negotiators Meet the Academics at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies of the European University Institute in Florence discussed the role of Developing Countries in the Doha Round: WTO Decision-Making Procedures and WTO Negotiations on Trade in Agricultural Goods and Services. As in the 2002 conference(1) and 2003 conference, leading academics presented ten papers on the pertinent subjects of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and WTO negotiators commented on these reports, eliciting stimulating discussions among WTO ambassadors, other practitioners from developed and less-developed WTO member countries, economists, political scientists and legal academics.(2) This mini-symposium reproduces
   the updated text of the keynote speech by Peter Sutherland, former Director-General of the WTO, on the Development Agenda of the Doha Round;
   the evaluation by Faizel Ismail, Head of the South African Delegation to the WTO in Geneva and Chairman of the WTO negotiations on special and differential treatment, of the 'Development Perspective' of the WTO General Council Decision of July 2004;
   the policy proposals by Bernard Hoekman for helping less-developed WTO Members more effectively in implementing WTO rules and realizing the welfare gains offered by the WTO;
   and the suggestions by John S. Odell for enhancing the capacity of WTO chairs to influence consensus-building, and the resulting distribution of gains and losses, with due regard to the need for inclusive decision-making in the WTO.
   This introduction discusses the general question underlying all conference papers: How can the development objectives of the Doha Round be defined more convincingly? Unless the Doha Round delivers obvious advantages for less-developed WTO Members that are also accepted by national parliaments and civil society as justified and 'just', the needed consensus on a successful conclusion of the 'Development Round' risks remaining elusive.

TI WTO after Seattle. Ideological powerhouse in need of political
   sustainability
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB The breakdown of negotiations on a 'Millennium round' in the WTO has left the world trade organisation on a sidetrack. The breakdown, which did not come unexpectedly, was caused by a combination of political, institutional and cognitive-ideational factors. While WTO's purpose remains to enhance market liberalisation under a non-discrimination regime (efficacy goal), it is in need of renewed legitimacy and also greater organisational efficacy. A contradiction has emerged between the formal (consensus, one nation-one vote) and informal (great power dominance) structures that undermines its legitimacy in the eyes of in particular many developing countries and civil society. While the WTO will have to live with such a dualistic decision-making system, a new balance between the two structures will have to be struck. Also the tendency to force new items on to its agenda and speed up liberalisation has turned out to be counterproductive. At the same time, the capacity of the organisation to handle the agenda is far from sufficient. One solution which may reduce this problem and at the same time could offer greater legitimacy is to 'out-source' several pre-negotiation tasks to other institutions, mainly UNCTAD, UNEP and other UN bodies, and consider seriously to leave work on social clauses to the ILO.

TI Is China's accession to WTO threatening exports of developing countries?
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Using the "revealed competitive advantage indices" for exports and imports, the paper is devoted to the analyses of the vulnerability of selected developing countries if China's competitive position is improved due to its entry to World Trade Organization (WTO). In contrast to the existing literature, which concentrates on labour-intensive products as a group, this paper considers products at a disaggregate level because products in the same group are not often homogeneous. It is argued that the competitive effects of China's accession on developing countries are exaggerated in the literature.
   In labour-intensive manufactured goods, China competes mainly with South Asian countries (e.g., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal) and a few Latin American and African countries. However, it also provides them with little demand complementary effects. Nevertheless, some Latin American and African countries may benefit from the expansion of China's imports of foods and agricultural raw materials. In the final market for capital goods, China competes with Asian newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and in a limited number of goods with Mexico and Costa Rica. For NIEs, unlike others, such competition involves complementary effects through the import of parts and components, which will overoffset the competition effects in the short and medium run. As China develops its capacity to produce components, however, the "competition" effect may dominate.
   China's export structure is similar to that of the Republic of Korea and Malaysia in the final market for a number of "finished" capital goods. By contrast, Thailand is vulnerable in clothing, miscellaneous household equipment, and electric machinery. Indonesia has little to worry except for furniture. India concentrates mainly on undergarments and China in outer garments. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Viet Nam, and Nepal have similar export structure with China in some clothing items; however, overall, they (particularly Viet Nam) have been aggressive in exportation of these products. Sri Lanka and Pakistan also compete with China in toys and sporting goods, but both have shown some strength in their exports.
   Except Mexico, Costa Rica, Haiti, and to some extent Uruguay, the export structure of the Latin American countries is mostly different from that of China. Mexico has a strong competitive position vis-a-vis China in a number of clothing items but weaker in a few assembly operations. Costa Rica's competitive advantage has noticeably improved for a number of clothing items and a few assembly operations. Haiti competes with China in eight products, mostly clothing. It has a strong competitive position in footwear, one clothing item, and some base metal. Uruguay's relative competitive position is weak in a number of labour-intensive products. The export structure of African countries is different from that of China, except for Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Malawi. These countries have improved their competitive position in their clothing.
   China's entry into the WTO will not change, for some time, its market access for textiles and clothing for it to be a threat to other developing countries. Nevertheless, if China attempts devaluation, the situation could change radically. China's devaluation is, however, unlikely. Over a longer term, much depends on what policy China will pursue in its trade and industrialization. China's attempt in increasing domestic value added in exports could lead to improvement in its competitiveness in technology/skill-intensive products of interest to NIEs and the ASEAN.

TI The Geneva effect: where officials sit influences where they stand on
   WTO priorities*
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Do representatives of member states in Geneva and officials based in capitals agree on priorities for cooperation in the World Trade Organization? Exploiting an original survey of trade policy officials, we find that respondents representing their countries in Geneva often accord substantially different priorities to institutional reform and policy issues than officials based in capitals. We hypothesize that this 'Geneva effect' reflects bureaucratic capacity in capitals and autonomy of Geneva-based officials, and that the effect should be smaller for officials from OECD member states, given extensive interaction outside the WTO to define good regulatory policies and address trade issues of common concern. Empirical analysis supports these hypotheses but also reveals differences in prioritization between Geneva and capital-based officials from OECD countries for specific issues. The results suggest that the prospects of international cooperation may be influenced not only by well-understood differences between states that reflect material interests and domestic political economy drivers, but by differences in relative priorities accorded to issues by officials representing states in international organizations and officials based in capitals.

TI The effects of trade-induced worker displacement on health and mortality
   in Mexico
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB Recent research in the U.S. links trade-induced job displacement to deaths of despair. Should we expect the same mortality response in developing countries? This paper analyzes the effect of a trade-induced negative shock to manufacturing employment on leading causes of mortal-ity in Mexico between 1998 and 2013. I exploit cross-municipality variation in trade exposure based on differences in industry specialization before China's accession to the WTO in 2001 to identify labor-demand shocks that are concentrated in manufacturing. I find trade-induced job loss increased mortality from diabetes, raised obesity rates, reduced physical activity, and low-ered access to health insurance. These deaths were offset by declines in mortality from ischemic heart disease and chronic pulmonary disease. These findings highlight that negative employment shocks have heterogeneous impacts on mortality in developing countries, where falling incomes lead to less access to health care and nutritious food, but also reduce alcohol and tobacco use.

TI Turning Trips on Its Head: An "IP Cross Retaliation" Model for
   Developing Countries
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The biblical David vs. Goliath paradigm plays out very frequently in international trade disputes. In 2003, a tiny island state, Antigua and Barbuda (hereafter Antigua) took on the United States (hereafter U.S.) in a WTO (World Trade Organization) dispute, alleging that the U.S. violated the General Agreement on Trade in Services (hereafter GATS) obligations by effectively foreclosing its borders to overseas internet gambling services. It won at both the panel and the appellate levels. However, to this date, it has been unable to secure compliance by the U.S.
   This paper considers "cross retaliation" by suspending intellectual property rights under the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (hereafter TRIPS) as a viable remedy for developing countries such as Antigua that often find themselves at the receiving end of WTO inconsistent measures maintained by countries that are economically more powerful.
   Towards this end, it proposes a "Tiered IP suspension model," where certain kinds of Intellectual Property (hereafter IP) are targeted first for suspension before others, depending on the ease of objectively ascertaining the harm caused by the unauthorized use of such IP and/or the potential to induce compliance by the defaulting state. Illustratively, copyrights over sound recordings that have established rates for public performance are targeted first. If working with this tier of IP subject matter does not yield desired results, then the complaining state moves on to other IP where it is relatively more difficult to compute the loss caused to the IP owner (such as pharmaceutical patents) but which may be a more powerful tool to induce compliance. Such a model could be useful for a large number of developing countries, such as India and Brazil, that often find that, despite WTO victories, scofflaw states such as the U.S. and EU fail to comply. Towards this end, this paper offers a very concrete "development" oriented international trade law remedy.

TI The political economy of intellectual property rights: the paradox of
   Article 27 exemplified in Ghana
SO REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Orthodox copyright scholarship frames piracy in 'developing' countries as a detrimental and illegal practice that results from these countries' lack of economic, social and cultural development. It argues that piracy needs to be discouraged, regulated, and finally overcome for legitimate business to flourish. In this article, the authors challenge this viewpoint and question whether the implementation of international copyright instruments in legislation across Africa really promotes those local economies or if it merely exposes them to neo-colonial exploitation. While the early international treaties on intellectual property rights (IPR) were formulated by European states and implemented in most parts of Africa through colonial laws, more recent legislation has been globally implemented through institutions such as the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, which remain dominated by Western interests. Through a structured overview of the adoption of IPR treaties in African countries, the authors advance a political economy perspective of intellectual property rights as a (neo-)colonial regime.

TI Border Carbon Adjustments Based on Avoided Emissions: Addressing the
   Challenge of Its Design
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Carbon pricing is an essential instrument to address climate change. However international differences in carbon control policies may cause not only carbon leakage but also competitiveness disadvantages. In this context, border carbon adjustments are a promising tool for discouraging these problems. But designing a real-world border carbon adjustment instrument implies to consider significant issues: technical feasibility, data availability, the risk of retaliation from developing countries, and its compatibility within the World Trade Organization legal framework. There are still no conclusive answers about a proper design. This paper is an attempt to address the above-mentioned challenges proposing a carbon border tax (CBT) based on avoided emissions. Such a CBT is applied at a product level and not at a sector level, and all international prices are deflated to guarantee that import 'like' goods received a treatment similar to 'like' domestic products. Using the WIOD, we simulate a CBT based on avoided emissions applied by the European Union, and we compare the results with a CBT based on embodied emissions.

TI Formulas and Flexibility in Trade Negotiations: Sensitive Agricultural
   Products in the World Trade Organization's Doha Agenda
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Many trade negotiations involve large cuts in high tariffs, while allowing smaller cuts for an agreed share of politically sensitive products. The effects of these flexibilities on market access opportunities are difficult to predict, creating particular problems for developing countries in assessing whether to support a proposed trade agreement. Some widely used ad hoc approaches for identifying likely sensitive products-such as the highest-bound-tariff rule-suggest that the impact of a limited number of such exceptions on average tariffs and market access is likely to be minor. Applying a rigorous specification based on the apparent objectives of policymakers in setting the prenegotiation tariff enables more accurate assessment of the implications of sensitive-product provisions for average agricultural tariffs, economic welfare, and market access under the Doha negotiations. The analysis concludes that highest-tariff rules are likely to seriously underestimate the impacts on average tariffs and that treating even 2 percent of tariff lines as sensitive is likely to have a sharply adverse impact on economic welfare. The impacts on market access are also adverse, but much smaller, perhaps reflecting the mercantilist focus of the negotiating process. JEL codes: C8, F13, F17, Q17

TI Adding a new perspective to US agricultural trade policy
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB US farmers and ranchers have actively pursued markets in foreign countries for their products since the 1970s. This priority was reflected by the US Congress in 1978 enacting the first set of laws establishing programs aimed at promoting US agricultural exports. In 1986, the US government initiated its first trade negotiations, with the government of Canada, with the express goal of liberalizing access in that market to all US food and agricultural exports. Since that time, the US government has completed free trade agreements with 20 countries, six in DR-CAFTA, 13 in bilateral agreements and adding Mexico to create NAFTA. The US government also devotes considerable resources to detecting and combatting unfair barriers to trade, through informal channels as well as through WTO dispute settlements. However, these tools primarily focus on capturing larger slices of existing markets. To generate better returns, we need to focus more energy on efforts to generate increased demand in developing countries, by helping their agricultural economies prosper. Once those economies are growing, the other tools can be utilized.

We analyze both the written questions submitted and the oral declarations delivered by the WTO members in all 95 trade policy reviews in the six-year period of 2009-2014. Descriptively, we find that the European Union and the United States are the most active members, but that the so-called 'rising' powers - namely China, Brazil, and India - very closely follow. In addition, almost the entire membership is involved in reviewing activity, at least to some extent. The explanatory results reveal that activity in the TPRM is strongly associated with a country's market size. However, the member states' overall aggregate membership in international organizations plays an almost equally important role.

TI Making the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism acceptable and climate
   friendly for least developed countries
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Implementation of CBAM to support EU climate neutrality by 2050 has raised several concerns. As the mechanism aims to minimise leakage through equal fairness in global mitigation, imposing carbon tariffs on the EU's imports of energy-intensive goods could curtail the export of EU trading partners. This might be detrimental, especially to the LDCs, due to their high exposures and vulnerability risks. This paper assesses and quantifies the implication of EU-CBAM and analyses eight complementary measures to mitigate the impacts on LDCs. Scenario developments are constructed by projecting the EU's new climate targets relative to the reference scenario of the EU's current policies. A more stringent climate target results in carbon leakage, and implementing CBAM will reduce the rate by one-third by 2040. The analysis also confirms significant welfare loss for LDCs through declining exports. Exempting LDCs from EU CBAM is less justifiable, as this measure results in greater leakage than other options. A further assessment confirms that policy recommendation for CBAM complementary measures should focus on the climate transformation pathway for LDCs. EU CBAM implementation with revenue-redistribution targeted to promote clean and efficient use of energy in LDCs has improved the welfare of recipient countries, substantially reduced leakage, and proven cost-efficient for the EU.

TI Globalisation, state regulation and industrial upgrading of the oil seed
   industries in Malaysia and Brazil
SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB Palm oil from Malaysia and soybean meal from Brazil are of major importance in the world market. State regulation in bath countries has played a crucial role in agro-industrial upgrading, i.e. the establishment, consolidation and diversification of manufacturing capacity in the oil seed chains. In particular, sufficient volumes of raw materials for local processing have been secured through systems of differential export taxes. This core set of regulatory mechanisms has been used in both countries, despite structural differences between the two chains related to the properties of the crops (oil palms and soybeans), the previous organisation of agricultural production, and the size and nature of the local markets. Globalisation in its present neoliberal form, institutionalised within the World Trade Organisation, gradually erodes the opportunity for other developing country states to upgrade agro-industries by adapting similar forms of regulatory mechanisms.

   results
SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB Using a global general equilibrium numerical model system with endogenous trade imbalance, this paper simulates the potential economic impacts of different WTO reform scenarios on China. The simulation results show that ending China's 'special and differential treatment' (SDT) alone would have a negative impact on China's social welfare and GDP, but the impact on manufacturing employment and foreign trade would be positive. The results of a simultaneous withdrawal of SDT from China, Brazil, India, and South Africa would be in line with the effect of China's separate exit, but China's damage would be lessened. If all developing countries were to withdraw from SDT, China's losses would be further reduced. If the WTO reform goals were to promote and achieve a new round of global trade liberalisation, China's welfare, output, manufacturing employment, and foreign trade would all improve significantly.

TI After TRIPS: Can India Remain 'the Pharmacy of the Developing World'?
SO SOUTH ASIA-JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES
AB India has long played a key role in supplying low-cost pharmaceuticals to people in developing countries, gaining a reputation as 'the pharmacy of the developing world'. Yet, changes to India's intellectual property regime under the World Trade Organization's 1995 Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement mean that India's capacity to produce and supply affordable medicines has been undermined. We use a political economy approach to investigate the factors that are determining the future of Indian generic pharmaceutical companies as suppliers of affordable medicines in the 'post-TRIPS' environment. We argue that while there is some scope within this environment for legal safeguards to protect access to life-saving medicines, the future of the 'pharmacy of the developing world' is in question, not just because of the ownership rights awarded to multinational corporations (MNCs) under the TRIPS framework, but also because of the way the market system is tilted towards MNCs. MNCs can 'play' the system locally and across the world, including by exerting pressure on safeguards that India instituted to protect the affordability of medicines. Against this background, we explore the challenges faced by the Indian government in creating an environment that is more likely to ensure access to life-saving medicines.

TI The Uneasy Interplay between Digital Inequality and International
   Economic Law
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB This article addresses the questions of what role international economic law has played in the story of digital inequality's emergence and evolution and how international economic law can reduce digital inequality instead of enhancing it. The first part of this study illustrates the uneasy interplay between digital inequality and international economic law. At the network layer, the economic benefit of the General Agreement on Trade in Services' Mode 3 (foreign investment) market access commitments in the telecommunications sector has never been realized in many developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). There is a missing link between the consequences of trade liberalization and broadband investment. At the application layer, today's platformization of services was an 'unforeseen development' at the time the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established. Through the pro-liberalization of WTO jurisprudence, members' decades-old Mode 1 (cross-border) market access commitments have played more than a marginal legal role in global datafication. The second part of this study discusses how international economic law can confront and potentially redress that inequality. In the context of trade and development, it remains to be seen how the WTO members can find the common ground needed to balance digital trade liberalization and development needs. Unless infrastructure concerns from developing countries and LDCs are addressed, the ongoing WTO e-commerce trade deal may end up being labelled the Digital 'Haves' Trade Agreement. In the context of trade and competition, the increasing inequality in digital platforms calls for a set of international competition rules to appropriately address market power in the data sector. By imposing cross-border disciplines for competition policy and thus curbing the power of big digital platforms, the proposed WTO Data Reference Paper may well be an effective instrument to address the second dimension of 'digital inequality' - data colonization.

SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB The current multilateral trading system under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO) displays a substantial development gap in the regulatory and institutional frameworks. The Doha Round negotiations, which was initiated to promote development interests under the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), have not been concluded for over 14 years, raising doubts about the ability of the WTO system to promote development interests effectively. While the Doha Round was sluggish for a number of years, regional trade agreements, which currently include every WTO Member, have been proliferated, creating significant implications for developing countries. This article examines the development of the Doha Round, analyzes the causes of its impasse, and explores its future prospects. The article also discusses the development gap in the current trading system and advances reform proposals to fill the gap in the system.

TI Brexit: Trade Governance and Legal Implications for Third Countries
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The impact of Brexit on the trade relations of EU/UK with third countries is likely to entail an extensive process of amendment to the disciplines and sectoral obligations featured in their current multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements. At the WTO, the UK stance will require amending the current EU lists of concessions in a way that may lead to a broad renegotiation process. At the bilateral level, the status of current EU agreements regarding the UK and third countries is uncertain, as these agreements may no longer apply to the UK. Further, agreements on goods, such the customs union with Turkey, will no longer be valid for the UK. Least developed countries (LL)Cs) and developing countries who benefit from the EU Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) will continue under this regime, but that framework will no longer be applicable to the UK. In all cases, third countries who consider that Brexit has diminished the value of their commitments may request compensation or changes in the text of the agreements, or ultimately terminate the agreement. The process of amending the trade and investment agreements requires comprehensive knowledge of their trade and investment flows with the EU and the UK.

TI Patents and Access to Antiretroviral Medicines in Vietnam after World
   Trade Organization Accession
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, where they are accessible, have been shown to prolong the lives and increase the health and well-being of people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In general terms, whether a country is able to provide affordable ARVs to people in need is determined by the pricing structure of the drugs, which is in turn based on the patent environment that regulates them. Increasing access in many developing countries, including Vietnam, requires a thorough understanding of the patent environment and of the legal options that will allow the production and/or importation of affordable treatments. This article provides an analysis of current patent law in Vietnam with regard to the production and importation of pharmaceuticals. It then reviews the current situation of supply of ARVs with regard to pharmaceutical patents and Vietnam's obligations and practices against international agreements. The study concludes by suggesting options for utilizing current law to improve access to ARVs and makes recommendations for the implementation of Vietnamese patent law.

AB In developing countries Globalization, Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and policies of World Trade Organization are warmly debated. The governments of member countries are committed to achieve MDGs. Many targets that were set to achieve MDGs had been reached by some of the countries but still there is lot of work that remains to be done to meet all the Millennium Development Goals. Issues of ethics, corporate social responsibility, WTO policies and government funding seem to be the main obstacle for achieving MDGs. Therefore, it is important to build a relationship to implement development programs between government and business enterprises that implement corporate social responsibility (CSR). By conducting a literature survey this paper shows that Government and businesses in many countries need to corporate and streamline their goals and motives relating to MDG. In addition this paper also sheds some light on national policies and policies of WTO in relation to MDGs.

AB The question of how to produce 'global public goods' in a world of sovereign states with divergent norms and preferences, reflecting differences in economic development levels, is increasingly on the international policy agenda. This question raises issues not only for political decision-making but also for judicial interpretation of existing international agreements. This article analyzes this fundamental question in the context of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), with particular emphasis on patent protection for pharmaceutical products. The TRIPS Agreement's provisions raise concerns over at least three public (or quasi-public) goods in this area: the generation of new knowledge, the provision of public health, and the maintenance of rules fostering open trade and competition. WTO judicial panels charged with resolving disputes regarding patents on medicines must determine whether to defer to national sovereignty, multilateral negotiations, or their own interpretations in balancing among these objectives. Thus, questions of 'who participates' and 'who decides' will be critical in this determination. The article notes structural weaknesses in the ability of developing countries to participate meaningfully in the WTO judicial process and offers suggestions for making their participation more meaningful so as to protect their interests.

AB DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane)) is a persistent organic pollutant that accumulates in food chains. Virtually every sample of breast milk analysed contains DDT and a persistent metabolite, DDE (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene). Food is the main source of contamination. In developing countries, the FAO/WHO acceptable daily intake (ADI) for DDT is often approached or exceeded, despite a global ban on DDT use in agricultural production. The FAO/WHO Coder Alimentarius Commission has established maximum residue limits (MRLs) for DDT in a range of commodities such as cereal grains, milk, meats, and eggs. The MRLs are recognised by the World Trade Organization as the international references in assessing non-tariff barriers to trade, but enforcement requires analytical facilities and trained personnel. In developing countries, analytical techniques such as gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are often too expensive or lack sufficient throughput to justify their use in all cases. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) offers an alternative technique that can screen large numbers of samples, rapidly identify commodities exceeding MRLs, or identify the source of contamination.
   This paper describes a joint project between the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory and the CSIRO to apply an ELISA method for determining DDT/DDE in food and environmental samples. The DDT/DDE immunoassay is a polyclonal antibody-based laboratory assay for the semi-quantitative determination of residues of DDT and DDE. The antibody also detects DDD (also known as TDE, 1,1-dichloro-1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane), a minor metabolite. Detection of DDA. (2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), the mammalian acidic metabolite, is 20 times less sensitive than DDT.
   The assay uses competitive ELISA format where the antibody is freeze-dried onto microwell plates and the free DDT or DDE in the test sample competes with an enzyme-labelled pesticide for antibody binding. Unbound enzyme-labelled pesticide is removed by a washing buffer, and bound enzyme-labelled pesticide is activated by adding a mixture of substrate-chromogen which produces as coloured reaction product. DDT or DDE in the rest sample is quantified by comparing colour development in the sample wells with that of wells containing standards. Less DDT or DDE in the test sample will result in more enzyme conjugate bring bound, which leads to greater colour development.
   A kit for this assay is available, complete with external quality assurance samples and a protocol which includes a list of equipment required to conduct the assay, as well as derails of data acceptance and interpretation. Examples for soil and food matrices will be described, and an overview given of a collaborative research program involving participants from 17 countries.

TI Enduring trade disputes: Disguised protectionism and duration and
   recurrence of international trade disputes
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Why do some WTO trade disputes endure and recur while others do not? States have difficulty resolving trade conflicts when they involve certain types of trade-restrictive domestic regulations. While such regulations vary in their extent of legitimacy-fulfilling non-trade domestic regulatory objectives and availability of less trade-restrictive options-complainant states cannot always distinguish legitimate barriers from illegitimate ones. In such scenarios of disguised protectionism, which I argue is most prevalent with policies involving WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, disputants confront difficulties concluding their disputes. Disputes last longer and are more likely to recur. I test the argument against a data set of WTO disputes structured in an innovative manner-one that links together related and recurring disputes into single conflicts. Both an event history analysis of conflict duration and a count analysis of conflict recurrence using this data strongly support this argument.

TI Does legal capacity matter? A survey of WTO Members
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB Previous studies of WTO dispute settlement have sought to evaluate whether a Member's legal capacity influences its odds of bringing litigation before the multilateral trade regime. Because direct measures of legal capacity are elusive, these studies have had to use indirect proxies, such as per capita income or number of delegates in Geneva. Yet, the reliability of these measures is questionable. To gauge legal capacity more directly, we surveyed all WTO Members, posing questions concerning their professional staff, bureaucratic organization at home, bureaucratic organization in Geneva, experience handling general WTO matters, and involvement in WTO litigation. Using responses from this survey, we constructed an index of Members' WTO legal capacity that speaks more fully to the challenges of dispute settlement than do commonly used proxies, none of which are strongly correlated with our measure. We supplemented this survey with over three dozen semi-structured interviews with Members' representatives in Geneva, the results of which bear out the importance of properly measuring legal capacity.

AB The approval of the TRIPS agreement at the end of the Uruguay Round of the GATT resulted in an enlargement of the protection of the copyright, in a way that the discussions on the protection of the pharmaceutical patents, the right to health and the access to medicines have repercussions in several international forums, such as World Trade Organization, United Nations and the World Health Organization. This subject has also involved different non-governmental organizations. Such mobilizations resulted of the creation of obligations that had limited the capacity of the developing countries to implement public politics in the area of public health, mainly the programs of free distribution of drugs for diseases such as AIDS that depend substantially on the medicine importation for its maintenance. The "Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and the Public Health", approved in the Ministerial Conference of the WTO, carried through in Doha (2001), is resulted of a consensus regarding the necessity to limit the protection of the pharmaceutical patents in order to guarantee the right to health (access to medicines), having introduced important interpretation regarding the limitation of the rights of the titleholders of patents facing to the right of the States to adopt public politics in the area of public health.

AB There are still hungry people in the world in the 2151 century, however, in some regions there are surpluses of food. According to the FAO the number of undernourished people rises to 963 million compared with 923 million in 2007. Hunger (and poverty as well) is concentrated in the developing countries in agriculture and rural areas. Therefore economic growth is needed to decrease the level of undernourished population (e.g., increasing the level of food security). It should be connected with agricultural development and international trade liberalisation within the globalisation process and the scarcity of natural resources. The article discusses the WTO agricultural negotiation and its effect on developing countries. The agenda of agricultural trade liberalisation, which was established on the Uruguay Round, did not fulfil the expectations of poor countries. Liberalisation itself was not a sufficient factor to spur trade. The additional barriers were placed for example in agricultural policy of the developed countries, the imperfect agricultural market and the lack of infrastructure and institutions. In the process of creating new world trade regime people have to consider evolution of the world agriculture, motives and levels of agricultural sector support, implementation of new technology and climate changes. The trade liberalisation should be accompanied by coherent policies both at national and international level.

AB This chapter discusses the evolution of the concept of policy coherence for development (PCD) since the beginning of the twenty-first century. It finds that, despite rhetorical commitments made in various contexts, results have been modest, as governments in the North have found it difficult to go beyond their short-term political and economic interests. This chapter concentrates not only on explanations related to the widened agenda in international development and the domestic structures within individual countries, but also on two additional significant factors. First, the search for PCD can be understood as a rhetorical attempt to shift responsibilities from aid agencies to actors involved in other public policy areas affecting developing countries. Second, the two actors pushing the PCD agenda forward - the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the European Commission (EC) - have had other interests beyond development effectiveness. The EC has been concerned with projecting a common European vision in international development and increasing the visibility of the European Union (EU) in international affairs, while the DAC has tried to protect its role and relevance in the field of international development.

AB Opinions vary on the nature of prior negotiation, as well as the meaning of adequate remuneration for CL under Art. 31 of the TRIPS Agreement. A review of the historical negotiating process and current practice in different jurisdictions shows that "prior negotiation", designed as a procedure to protect patent holders, is interpreted differently among WTO members due to the ambiguity of the TRIPS Agreement. Art. 31 of the TRIPS Agreement leaves great flexibilities for WTO members to qualify the requirement for "prior negotiation". Moreover, the TRIPS Agreement does not specify the meaning of "adequate remuneration" for CL. This chapter argues that WTO members enjoy great flexibilities to determine the adequate remuneration and the purpose of CL, as opposed to other circumstances, which deserves particular consideration. Also, the rules and procedures for setting remuneration for CL should be easy to predict. It is advisable for WTO members to adopt specific rules on determining the "reasonable commercial terms" and "reasonable period of time". This chapter further examines the existing methods to assess the remuneration for CL of pharmaceutical patents, arguing that the well-recognised guidelines proposed by the UNDP and the WHO could serve as guidance for setting the CL royalty in developing countries.

SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) have become ubiquitous in the current debate and have emerged as the key issue of global innovation policy. The 'Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights' (TRIPS) Agreement, signed in 1994 as a founding element of the World Trade Organisation, represents the most important attempt to establish a global harmonisation of Intellectual Property protection. The aim of this article is to re-examine critically what has become the common wisdom around IPRs, TRIPS and their effects. We argue that supporters of IPRs in western corporations and governments as well as detractors in global movements and developing countries have overestimated their importance in the process of generation and diffusion of knowledge and innovation. On the basis of some key learned lessons on the nature of innovation and technological change, we assess four theses about TRIPS and its impact on the global generation and distribution of knowledge. Finally, the policy implications concerning international organisations and technological transfer are discussed.

TI US-China Trade War An Impetus for New Norms on Technology Transfer
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Tins article argues that the trade dispute between United States (US) and China should be an impetus for new rules and norms regarding technology transfer at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Technology transfer is a desirable outcome under WTO rules, including the Trade-Related Intellectual property Rights Agreement. However, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) have [riled to effectively promote and facilitate technology transfer. The problem lies in the nature of the intellectual property rights that TRIPS are intended to protect and enforce. Though necessary, by conferring exclusive rights to its holder, intellectual property rights have die unintended consequences of inhibiting competition and technology transfer. Furthermore, it may impede the transfer of technology from developed countries to developing countries where firms often lack the capacity to further innovate the technology it has acquired. Tins article proposes new norms at the WTO, in particular the TRIPs and SCM Agreement, to improve its efficacy in promoting and facilitating technology transfer.

AB The paper looks at why foreign companies outsource or locate their high-tech production, R & D (research & development) and design to China..
   Moreover it looks at the competitive advantage which China offers in terms of abundant labor force, low wages, large domestic market and excellent infrastructure as compared to the rest of the emerging markets and developing countries.
   This type of knowledge-based outsourcing also leads to faster innovation and the companies reach the global market quicker. The focus of the paper is on Asia with particular reference to China, India, Vietnam, and Thailand.
   The empirical study shows that China has tremendous advantages over its neighboring countries particularly due to its well developed infrastructure and large domestic market.
   China is also seriously implementing the WTO (World Trade Organization) agreements in terms of tariffs and non-tariffs barriers. However, the cost is rising due to inflation, wage increases and imported raw materials.
   The IPR (intellectual property rights) protection is weak in China as compared to India and few other Asian countries. If China does not develop its IPR protection system and control cost then it is on its way to remain a world factory with low value added production.
   Finally, advice given to foreign companies is that China is a suitable place for knowledge-based outsourcing as long as there is IPR protection and cost advantages.

TI Essential medicines and the TRIPS Agreement: collision between the right
   to health and intellectual property rights
SO SALUD COLECTIVA
AB The strengthening of pharmaceutical patent protection globally puts strains on access to essential medicines. According to the present paper, this process has led to the collision of the intellectual property rights adopted in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and the right to health stated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICE SCR). Several controversies disputed in the WTO illustrate the confrontation between countries with a powerful pharmaceutical industry and the interests of developing countries. It is concluded that the TRIPS-plus rules subscribed to by developing countries in free trade agreements which give the pharmaceutical patent holder more rights than those stipulated in the original TRIPS Agreement are incompatible with the obligations to provide access to essential medicines under the right to health of the ICESCR.

TI Theoretical Basis and Regulatory Framework for Microtrade: Combining
   Volunteerism with International Trade towards Poverty Elimination
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Poverty remains a serious global issue, and nearly half of the world's populations are still living below the poverty line. International trade has been a vehicle for successful economic development for some developing economies in East Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and more recently, China. With the success of their trade-based economic development policies and the export-driven development strategy, all of these countries escaped from poverty.
   Can other developing countries duplicate this success and also bring their populations out of poverty? Some factors, including political stability, organized government support, educated workforce, availability of foreign markets, and financial resources such as foreign loans, have been considered essential for the success of this export-driven economic development strategy. These factors are not present in many developing countries, particularly least-developed countries (LDCs), thus making it difficult for them to pursue successful trade-based development policies to break the circle of poverty.
   The author suggests "microtrade," defined as international trade of small quantities of locally-produced products (LPPs) produced on a small scale, as an alternative way to provide those living in LDCs with income sufficient to reduce or eliminate poverty. Microtrade, unlike the export-driven development policies undertaken at a national level, is not based on the development of large-scale export industries, which cannot be initiated by many LDCs. This article provides a discussion of the theoretical basis of microtrade and its regulatory framework from the perspective of international trade law.

TI What are the main factors that influence China's energy intensity?-Based
   on aggregate and firm-level data
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Understanding the main factors influencing energy intensity in China is important to reduce total energy consumption and protect the environment. Based on the OECD-WTO Database of Trade in Value-Added, we subdivide the secondary sector and employ the LMDI method to analyze how much changes in industrial structure and intra-industry energy intensity contribute to the overall change in energy intensity. The results prove that the change in intra-industry energy intensity is the main factor that influences the overall change in energy intensity in recent years. Furthermore, we use firm-level energy consumption data that cover various regions, scales and kinds of energy consumption, and employ firm fixed effects regression to analyze intra-industry influencing factors and find that the scale effect exists for coal, oil and electricity efficiency; foreign-invested firms have lower energy intensity; and firms in coal-rich areas have higher coal intensity. Our results show that if firms' energy intensity decreases to the level of firms with lower energy intensity within the industry, total energy consumption will decrease considerably without changing the output or industry structure. This paper will give implications for developing countries, where it is difficult to make industrial structural changes to reduce energy consumption. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI Bilateralism in services trade: Is there fire behind the (BIT-)smoke
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB In most of the current literature, the spread of regionalism in international trade relations is discussed in terms of a rapidly rising number of preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Far less attention is given to the even more rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and their overlap with obligations assumed by WTO Members under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). BITs generally apply across a much wider range of service sectors, in particular in the case of least-developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries, than those scheduled under the GATS. Furthermore, a number of relevant disciplines, including on fair and equitable treatment, expropriation and dispute settlement, may go beyond potential counterparts under the GATS. At the same time, pursuant to GATS Article II, these disciplines are to be applied on a most-favoured-nation (MFN) basis. Based on a comparative analysis of relevant provisions, this article discusses options on how WTO Members could proceed.

TI A REAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT? SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS TREATY
   OBJECTIVE IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS AND BEYOND
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB The European Community (EC) is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with several groups of developing countries. An element which the EC Commission likes to highlight is the objective of sustainable development. This article analyses the potential of this 'presiding principle' of sustainable development as a treaty objective in the EPAs and other treaties in international economic law. Defining parameters are the international law background on sustainable development and the role of treaty objectives in the process of interpretation. The main findings are that a sustainable development treaty objective is one (of many) legal tools to achieve an integration of economic, environmental and social interests. Its specific value lies in its substantive ambiguity which translates into domestic policy space in the implementation of international treaty obligations. This discretion is limited by any specific integration performed in the treaty negotiating process and expressed in individual treaty provisions. It is further qualified by the customary rules of treaty interpretation in international law where object and purpose is only one of several elements feeding into a holistic interpretation exercise. Its main weakness may be that it depends on domestic institutions to make effective use of the policy space to integrate and on international judicial bodies to exercise deference accordingly.

TI Trade policies and development of less-favoured areas: evidence from the

SO FOOD POLICY
CT Conference on Development Strategies for LFAs
CY JUL, 2002
CL Wageningen, NETHERLANDS
SP Wageningen Univ, IFPRI
AB The links between international markets and production and consumption decisions in less-favoured areas (LFAs) often appear rather loose. Hence, it may be questioned whether international trade and economic growth effects trickle down to LFAs. This paper explores the evidence in the literature in which direction and to what extent trade policy may effect the development of LFAs. The literature on modern trade and growth theory spell out conditions of sustained economic growth that are, nearly by definition, opposite to the conditions that hold for LFAs. Although the institutional economics literature is very much focused at the country level, it is clear that for LFAs with inadequate institutions and infrastructure, the effects of trade-led growth is often irrelevant. Further trade liberalisation will entail small or even detrimental effects for LFAs, with an exception for products suffering from tariff escalation and/or peak tariffs. The prevailing problem seems to be the lacking supply response to (international) price changes. The literature contains evidence that long-term growth strategies for less-favoured areas require the development of institutions and infrastructure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI WHY CHINA OPPOSES HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB China and other developing countries oppose the introduction of human rights at the workplace into the WTO while some developed countries argue that human rights obligations should be explicitly included in the WTO as a criterion of fair trade. While this is often framed as a debate about human rights, dignity, freedom, and respect, the debate, at least as between the United States and China, is really an economic debate masked as a moral or ethical one.
   The economic debate concerns whether the United States can use trade remedies within the WTO to neutralize two major rights and benefits that China enjoys under the WTO: the "no-quotas" rule - the right to be free from total or partial trade bans on its imports - and the right to tariffs bound under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which are at historically low levels. The ability to enjoy these two major benefits is essential to China's mercantilist strategy, which is to pursue economic growth through exports to the United States and other foreign markets. Until China joined the WTO in 2001, it was made to endure an annual review of its human rights record as a condition of receiving these trade benefits from the United States. Now that China is a WTO member, China has a legal right to these benefits. The debate over whether human rights at the workplace should be included in the WTO is, at its essence, a debate over whether now that China has joined the WTO, the United States can use human rights violations under WTO law as a justification for trade restrictions that neutralize or limit these benefits that allow China to aggressively export its products to the United States.

In so doing the paper argues that we need to understand the democratic deficit of these institutions not only in terms of input legitimacy, but also in terms of output legitimacy and procedural fairness. The level and quality of these three aspects of democracy vary depending upon the international institution in question, but each of these institutions suffers from a democratic deficit in all three spheres. The paper therefore puts forward several reform proposals in order to overcome the problems outlined.

TI Trade facilitation in the presence of non-independent impediments
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB With the virtual disappearance of tariffs, domestic export time delays have emerged as what is arguably the next most significant obstacle to trade. This may explain recent initiatives to combat delays independently of other trade transaction costs by a variety of regional and international organisations, including the WTO. Such initiatives have resulted in important reductions in export time delays in forty per cent of developing countries. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism by which reductions in delays induce governments to respond by increasing the export fees that they charge exporters. We test this prediction empirically and use a difference gravity approach to investigate the joint impact of both delays and export fees on the flow of trade. Our results support the hypothesis of endogenous export fees which suggests that policies targeting delays in isolation are, at least ex ante, suboptimal. Our findings further show that for exporters of low-value and time-insensitive goods, such as many developing countries, export fees are at least as significant an impediment to exports as delays.

TI Food Irradiation: The EU Regulatory Framework, Risk Assessment and
   International Trade Considerations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB This article looks at the different regulatory approaches on food irradiation, starting with international standards on food irradiation, describing the approach in the US and other third countries, and finally in the EU, where there has been a regulatory standstill since 1999. The current EU approach on food irradiation, which authorises irradiation of certain predefined product categories and sets upper dose limits, does not appear to be in line with the approach used under the relevant internationally-recognised standards, such as the Codex Alimentarius and the International Plant Protection Convention. There are potential legal conflicts between the current regulatory framework on food irradiation in the EU and the international trade framework of the World Trade Organization. Ultimately, the EU must base its measures on scientific principles, on relevant international standards, and choose the least trade-distortive measures that are available (i.e., ensure that they are applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health). In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority published new risk assessments on food irradiation, which the European Commission has requested in view of drafting new EU legislation on food irradiation, and which appear to open the way for a fundamental altering of the regulatory parameters (such that food irradiation regulations must be scientifically-justified and in line with the relevant international standards), and seem to weaken the EU stance vis-&-vis the possible instances where the current rules on food irradiation prevent (de jure or defacto) access to the EU market by third countries' operators and products, particularly those of developing countries.

TI The status of patenting plants in the Global South
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Over the last few decades, the number of patents on plants and plant parts has greatly increased in various parts of the world. Most research, however, has focused exclusively on developed countries-the United States and European Union states in particular-while little is known about the extent to which plants are being patented in other parts of the world. This article aims to fill this information gap by providing an overview of the status of patenting plants in the developing countries and emerging economies of the Global South. The research is based on the analysis of legal provisions, patentability guidelines, court decisions (where they exist) and a sample of patents granted in the countries selected for this study. The findings indicate that despite the flexibilities of the World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement regarding the nonpatentability of plants, 60% of the 126 countries in the Global South for which data were available to allow for the patenting of plants or parts thereof, and many such patents have been identified. This situation warrants further reflection and, potentially, review of existing patent laws as developing countries search for ways of responding optimally to the needs of feeding a growing population while adapting to the challenges of climate change.

TI China's policies on foreign-invested travel agencies upon its entry to
   the WTO What can foreign investors do?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Based on the commitments made when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China began to allow the establishment of foreign-invested travel agencies. During this transition period, China promulgated travel service-related policies and paid a great deal of attention to this specific business market. This paper aims to analyze the said tourism policies and provide suggestions to foreign investors for their future business activities in this promising market.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study uses both primary and secondary data to specify China's policies on foreign-invested travel agencies upon its accession to the WTO and discuss foreign investors' entry modes and operating strategies for joining the market. Hall's model is employed to examine the policy-making process, including policy demands, policy decisions, policy outputs, and policy impacts.
   Findings - Some foreign investment-related tourism policies were implemented ahead of the schedule to which China committed upon its entry to the WTO. The tight nature of the policies implemented meant that only 25 foreign-invested agencies had survived in China by August 2007. Industry professionals recruited for this study commented that the nature and pattern of FDI in this market has been successfully framed by the policies adopted.
   Practical implications - The entry modes that foreign investors in China's travel service market should adopt and the detailed operating strategies they should use are discussed.
   Originality/value - The paper can be seen as a successful and enlightening attempt to pave the way for future researchers to engage in further discussions about FDI in tourism in a political environment, particularly in developing countries.

SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Coalition formation is considered an important tool to leverage bargaining power in GATT/WTO negotiations. While most of the literature has focused on developing countries, we show that sizable economies are the primary users of coalitions at the GATT/WTO. We also find evidence that middle powers do not exhibit distinctive collectivist behavior at the WTO. There is a linear and strong relationship between countries' economic power-measured as real GDP-and coalition participation within the GATT/WTO system. We explain these results, presenting evidence that large economies-countries that have greater trade negotiations power-join coalitions more often because they are better equipped to absorb transaction costs and more prepared to deal with the uncertainty of WTO negotiations. We also found a relationship between coalition entry and trade openness, with countries more open to trade joining coalitions more often.

TI Private food standards and the World Trade Organization: some legal
   considerations
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB Private standards have increasingly become a contentious issue in the multilateral trading system. The ever increasing number of sector-specific standards developed by businesses, in particular in the food market, may have significant implications for developing countries in terms of market access. Some countries see private food standards as a particular form of non-tariff barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with non-tariff barriers in the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This paper examines to what extent these agreements cover private standards, as they were originally intended to regulate standard-setting by public authorities. We find that there is an important difference between the SPS Agreement and the TBT Agreement in that the drafters of the latter realized the importance of the private sector in standard-setting. Finally, we discuss whether a 'Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards', similar to that under the TBT Agreement, could be adopted under the SPS Agreement.

TI A method to prioritize the surveillance of chemicals in food commodities
   to access international market and its application to four countries in
   Sub-Saharan Africa
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The purpose of this study was to propose an approach to predict the distribution of chemicals in food in developing countries to assess consumer risk and access to the international market with a limited number of laboratory analyses. The first step consists of identifying the GEMS/Food Contaminants database and the chemical/food combination relevant for a particular country. The identification of critical chemical/food combination should be used to prioritize the analysis to be performed in a total diet study (TDS). The second step consists of modelling a distribution model based on the mean concentration generated from TDS associated with the variability observed in a larger dataset consisting of individual food contamination data from the GEMS food database. The simulated distributions may provide information regarding how to establish food safety standards and to assess the potential for accessing international market in the context of a value chain. This method is illustrated by case studies from the recent Regional TDS (RTDS) conducted in Sub Saharan Africa.
   We concluded that further work is needed to gain experience and to fully validate this approach. However, organized data sharing and developing harmonized methods for data analysis are key roles for international organizations, such as FAO, WHO, and WTO. Finally, it is important to remember that such a data-driven approach still requires significant investments in terms of human resources and analytical capacity.

TI The AGOA as stepping stone for USA-Africa free trade agreements
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how the pattern of trade relations between the USA and African countries is gradually shifting toward reciprocity. It therefore demonstrates that the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was conceived to be a building block toward future bilateral trade agreements.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a historical approach to the USA's policy toward Africa in general and in trade matters in particular. It critically reviews the chronology of US involvement in the continent.
   Findings Although it was designed as a preferential trade arrangement, AGOA was intended to evolve into reciprocal trade agreements. This is what the USA started doing even prior to the entry into force of the AGOA, by entering into Trade and Investment Framework Agreements with individual countries or blocs. It also transpires that the deployment comes as a response to the European Union which is already engaged in the redefinition of its own trade relations with Africa since 2004.
   Originality/value The paper is important in many respects. Not only it is a study of the US practice as preference-granting country, but it is also interested in the typology of trade agreements concluded by the USA in other regions of the world. This is important to indicate and analyze the types of provisions African countries should be expected to face when the time of entering into reciprocal binding trade treaties arrives.

The movement of the Indian pharmaceutical industry along the R& D value chain represents a remarkable shift from an importer to an innovator of drugs. The Indian government's industrial and technology policies along with changes in regulation of intellectual property rights played a crucial role in shaping this development of R& D capability. Using the ' capability creation model' this paper discusses the learning processes and stages involved in this dramatic accumulation of technological capability. This analysis shows that the Indian pharmaceutical industry has followed a trajectory from duplicative imitation to creative imitation to move up the value chain of pharmaceutical R& D. Finally as a result of changes in patent law the industry is learning to develop capabilities in innovative R& D. The basic and intermediate technological capabilities gained from imitative learning gave these firms a solid base for development of competence in advanced innovative R& D. These findings have implications for government policies as well as firm strategies in other developing countries albeit with some limitations due to global harmonisation of patent laws being promoted by the World Trade Organization.

TI Extending International Legal Aid from Trade to Investment: An Advisory
   Centre on International Investment Law
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
AB Several mechanisms at the international level provide legal aid to lower-income States to strengthen 'access to justice' and 'equality among States', whether through direct financial support or institutional legal assistance. After reviewing the concept of international legal aid, this article makes the case for the creation of an Advisory Centre on International Investment Law (ACIIL) to provide support to respondent States involved in disputes brought by private investors based on international investment treaties and other instruments, as part of investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS). The increasing costs, complexity and number of investor-State arbitrations has strengthened the need for an international legal aid mechanism in this area, to put under-resourced developing countries in a better position to have affordable access to justice and defend themselves adequately in international investment disputes. This would level the playing field, strengthen the confidence of governments in a reformed investment regime and thereby enhance its legitimacy. Drawing on the experience of the Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL), the article discusses the rationale, key features and current policy challenges of an Advisory Centre on International Investment Law.

TI The rule(s) of trade and the rhetos of development: Reflections on the
   functional and aspirational legitimacy of the WTO
SO COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW
AB This essay critically analyzes the role of development and poverty alleviation in the legal and institutional workings of the World Trade Organization (WTO). By analogy to Joseph Weiler's analysis of the dynamics of internal and external legitimacy in WTO dispute settlement, this essay suggests the existence of an asynchronicity in the evolution of the WTO, between the marked shift in the organizational rhetoric of "development," and the virtual standstill in the adaptation of the WTO's junctional design to its newly trumpeted development goals. One explanation for this suspension of progressive change is an intrinsic conflict within the WTO's legitimation needs, between the functional and aspirational dimensions of legitimacy. The rhetoric of development strays from this heritage and challenges it, to the point of depicting development as a metaright in international economic relations. The essay discusses in detail four areas in which the dissonance between function and aspiration is most acute, and in which fundamental rethinking and reform are required: (i) the unclear, changing telos of the WTO; (ii) the problem of defining development needs, interests, and policies for the purpose of implementing differential treatment; (iii) the dilemmas associated with the identification, classification, and differentiation of developing countries; and (iv) the inadequacy of reciprocity as an organizing legal principle in the development context.

TI Two-sided legitimation strategies: informal groups at the World Trade
   Organization
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Who engages in legitimation strategies in global governance and why and how do they do it? This article studies the legitimation strategies and legitimacy-generating capacity of low-authority institutions, specifically informal groups within formal international organizations (IOs). It argues that informal groups seek legitimation and they can also be a source of legitimation for formal IOs. In doing so, the article makes three contributions to recent legitimation literature: 1) contra recent arguments, it shows why not only high-authority, but also low-authority institutions have special incentives to engage in legitimation; 2) it expands our understanding of the reasons why institutions engage in legitimation, showing why authority-deficits can motivate legitimation; 3) it studies legitimation strategies to show when they are likely to be audience- or agent-driven. A case-study of informal groups at the World Trade Organization yields three policy implications. First, developing countries could invest greater resources in legitimizing informal groups in order to boost their representation and voice opportunities within IOs. Second, formal IOs can increase their own legitimacy by supporting informal groups that enhance the representation of marginalized members. Third, however, to the extent that these strategies deflect pressure for formal rule changes, increasing investments in informal groups may be a long-term liability for developing countries.

TI The Impact of ISO22000 Standard Diffusion on Agricultural Exports
SO WORLD TRADE REVIEW
AB The WTO SPS Agreement sets a framework of rules that encourages harmonization through international standards. However, there is a lack of empirical research at the macro-level on how such international standards affect trade flows. This study conducts a general impact analysis on one of the most widely used food-related international standards in the world, the ISO22000, accounting for the different product types and country groups. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, one of three sister organizations of the SPS Agreement, notably participated in developing this standard that is based on its Food Code, harmonizing the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). This study employs recent developments in using the gravity model, along with uniquely employed additional specifications to enhance further the reliability of the estimates. Results show that ISO22000 diffusion negatively affects the exports of processed products that are the major export goods of developed countries. Primary and semi-processed products that compose the majority of developing country exports are not significantly affected, providing evidence against the concerns for the compliance burdens of developing countries when being certified to the standard. The burdens may depend more on the degree of processing of the exported goods rather than on a country's development status.

TI Do Trade Agreements Increase Food Trade?
SO WORLD ECONOMY
AB In addition to multilateral trade agreements under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the world has seen a remarkable proliferation of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in the last two decades. This study investigates whether these multilateral and regional trade institutions increase food trade and bring the world into a freer flow of food. The gravity model of international trade is used for the empirical analysis. The model is developed in a large panel data setting and attempted to address some potential problems in the estimations including multilateral trade resistances, zero trade values and endogeneity. The results suggest that both the WTO and RTAs have delivered significant positive effects on trade among the participant countries, but not food. Only RTAs are found to have increased food trade among the participant countries. However, although on average the WTO is found to have negative implications on food trade, it facilitates the developing countries more than the developed countries.

AB The dispute settlement system (DSS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is considered as the "Jewel in the Crown" of the WTO, is also the busiest of its kind. While this no doubt reflects its success, the system is far from perfect, and has drawn criticism both from within and without the ranks of its users. This chapter presents a statistical analysis of over 20 years of WTO DSS, with a particular emphasis on questions of effectiveness. Questions examined include:
   1. Who are the member states using the WTO DSS? Is it used equally by developed, developing and least developed countries? Are poor countries more likely than rich ones to settle cases? Is there a correlation between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita of WTO members and the extent to which they use the system?
   2. What is the extent of compliance with binding recommendations of the DSB by member states? Are compliance disputes bona fide disputes about the meaning of a DSB ruling, or are they part of delaying tactics? Who are the members that do comply and who are the ones that do not?
   3. How long do DSS procedures take on the average, from request for consultations to adoption of recommendations? Has this time changed over time, from when the system began until today?
   4. Finally, the chapter will address the problem of the Appellate Body's inability to remand the case to the original panel for reconsideration and determination of relevant facts. It will examine how often this lack of authority frustrates the system's ability to conclude the DSS procedures with a clear ruling on all the disputed issues.

AB It is known that Intellectual Property Rights have been in a constant evolution since 1883 with the adoption of the Paris Convention, being today one of the main cores of the World Trade Organization regulation. But, this evolution has been surrounded by many controversies, specially regarding Patent Law and how this regulation has blocked developing and least developing countries access to essential medicine. In this sense, the WTO recognized the importance of been able to use flexibilities regarding Patent Law, to permit those countries with non or deficient technological and productive capacities to supply their local market; is in this context where WTO members achieve the first ever amendment to the trips Agreement in January 23rd 2017.

The Negotiation Group on Rules has regularly met in Geneva to fulfill the mandate. So far, there was broad agreement that the Group should strengthen discipline through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and over-fishing. However, several unresolved issues can be still identified. One is an issue on sustainable development. Specifically, the question "to what extent the WTO should incorporate the element of fishery resource conservation into its new discipline of fisheries subsidies" remains unresolved. This paper reviews current developments on the issue of fisheries subsidies discussed at the WTO, OECD, and other relevant international organizations.

TI Evolution of the global polyethylene waste trade system
SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Introduction: China's import bans on solid wastes starting from 2017 have challenged the global trade system of plastic wastes, which remains poorly characterized. This study chooses polyethylene (PE) as a case and aims to map out the global trade networks of PE waste (GPETN) from 1976 to 2017.
   Outcomes: We find that the size and complexity of the GPETN had been growing until 2016. After the mid-1990s, PE waste basically flowed from developed economies, mainly the EU and the US, to developing economies such as China. Since 2001 when admitted into the WTO, China's PE waste import surged until 2014 when it absorbed over 60% of global export. Regulations on solid waste import following the Green Fence campaign in 2013 resulted in substantial reductions in China's import as well as the global export of PE waste after 2014. Several other developing economies, such as Malaysia, Turkey, and Vietnam, had transitioned to net importers, but their imports were insufficient to replace China as new recycling bases for PE waste.
   Conclusion: The results highlight the urgent need of a joint effort for developed and developing countries to build a stronger global circular economy system with sufficient capacity to treat PE waste locally.

TI Does Aid for Information and Communications Technology Help Reduce the
   Global Digital Divide?
SO POLICY AND INTERNET
AB The Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative was launched at the 2005 World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference with the aim of helping developing countries develop their trade capacity and better integrate into the global trade system. This article examines the impact of Aid for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) (a component of AfT) on the global digital divide of recipient countries, measured by the Internet penetration rate (i.e., the proportion of individuals using the Internet in a given country) and the Internet penetration distance (i.e., the difference between a country's Internet penetration rate and the world average). The analysis was conducted on a sample of 119 countries, spanning the period 2004-2015. We find empirical evidence that higher AfT inflows for ICT are conducive to both higher Internet penetration rate and higher Internet penetration distance for recipient countries. However, more advanced AfT recipient-countries experience a higher positive effect of AfT for ICT than do relatively less advanced countries. These findings suggest that scaling up of AfT for ICT for developing countries (but particularly the poorest countries) is necessary to help them build the Internet-related infrastructure necessary to benefit from the growing digital economy.

TI Evolving Strategy: South-South Coalition in the GATT/WTO
SO CHINA AND WTO REVIEW
AB This research offers a concise retrospect on the South-South Coalition Strategy within multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT/WTO framework. The SSC strategy evolved in the postwar era, when the South integrated itself to demand for a New International Economic Order featured by fairness of outcome in international economic rules and activities. It then encountered an opponent trend of neo-liberalism, through which the South practically decided to sectoral exchange of economic interests with the North. From the new millennium onward, the South is learning to adopt a more issue-specific SSC strategy in trade negotiations. Although a question is arising for the future of SSC because of some emerging nations rising out from the traditional South group, a timely reflection from an evolutionary perspective would facilitate the understanding of the SSC strategy for weak countries to establish a fairer international economic order.

TI Export Cartels: Is it Legal to Target your Neighbour? Analysis in Light
   of Recent Case Law
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Despite the growing sophistication of antitrust regimes around the world, export cartels benefit from special treatment: they are almost universally tolerated, if not encouraged in the countries of origin. Economists do not offer an unambiguous policy recommendation on how to deal with them in part due to the lack of empirical data. This article discusses arguments for and against export cartels and it identifies the existing gaps in the present regulatory framework. The theoretical part is followed by an analysis of the recent case law: a US cartel challenged with different outcomes in India and South Africa, as well as Chinese export cartels pursued in the USA. The Chinese cases are particularly topical as the conduct at stake, apart from being subject to private antitrust actions before US courts, was also challenged within the WTO dispute settlement framework, pointing out to the existing interface between trade and competition. While the recent developments prove that unaddressed issues tend not to vanish, the new South-North dimension has the potential of placing export cartels again on the international agenda. Pragmatic thinking suggests looking for the solution within the WTO framework.

TI An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current veterinary
   systems in the developing world
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB The changes that veterinary services have undergone in the developing world over the last two decades are expected to continue and result in the further privatisation of selected tasks, the decentralisation of decision-making and a move towards more focus on public goods service delivery by State veterinary units. At the same time, global food consumption patterns are changing in numerous ways, which will certainly affect veterinary services delivery systems. These changes include a trend towards increasing globalisation, rapidly escalating consumer demand for animal protein, intensification of livestock production into larger units and growth of the trade of livestock and livestock products. Intensification of livestock production into larger units and global trade will increase the challenges resulting from the resurgence of serious animal diseases, food safety hazards and veterinary public health-related problems. Facing and managing these challenges raises issues related to animal health delivery systems and national policies that will have to be addressed. Strengthening the capacity of State veterinary units to respond to regulatory responsibilities dictated by national laws and international World Trade Organization and OIE (World organisation for animal health) health standards will be at the centre of animal health policies in most developing countries. Creating an environment which facilitates privatised service delivery and supports subcontracting is likely to contribute to improving economic efficiency and providing wider access to veterinary services. Equally important is the issue of professional development, which must be addressed by refocusing veterinary curricula and improving professional standards. The profession will then be in a better position to serve the needs of increasing numbers of consumers.

TI Trade-Climate Nexus: A Systematic Review of the Literature
SO ECONOMIES
AB In the climate-trade debate, moderate attention is dedicated to the role of trade agreements on climate. In turn, trade agreements could help countries meet climate goals by removing tariffs, harmonizing standards on environmental goods, and eliminating distorting subsidies on fossil fuels. This paper aims to provide an overview of the role of trade agreements on climate-change mitigation. This systematic literature review is based on the international economic literature published between 2010 and 2020. This literature review underlines that the effectiveness of the trade agreements and WTO negotiations on emission reduction is weak. This is due to different national interests and protectionism. The elimination of trade barriers stimulates trade, but this may also raise greenhouse gas emissions and cause other environmental problems (e.g., deforestation). Furthermore, this article points out that emission leakage is also a crucial issue hindering the success of global climate agreements on greenhouse gas reduction. The greatest beneficiaries of the trade agreements are usually the largest GHG emitters, such as China, the US, and the EU. By contrast, developing countries are in a weaker position regarding climate-trade negotiation. The literature review offers policy solutions which can contribute to emission reduction and tools for stimulating a trade-related climate-change abatement policy.

TI The Transformation of Biomedical Industry in China: From Academic Affair
   to Commercialization
SO JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES
AB China was the only developing country that participated in the human genome project and contributed 1% of human genome sequencing in 2000. And it finished rice genome sequencing independently in 2002. China's biomedical industry, however, remains largely an academic affair. The industry is characterized by its inability to support and commercialize innovative research, which in turn has resulted in the prevalence of generic drugs. Managers of Chinese firms have been focusing on the short-term profits that can be generated by generics rather than the longer-term potential profits arising from innovative research. But the viability of such short-cut strategy is now called into question as the IPR infringements will mean hefty fines to the violators in the wake of China's WTO accession. There is hence an urgent need to make the timely transformation from academic affair to commercialization. This paper examines the reasons why biomedical industry remains largely an academic affair in China by stacking China against the key success factors of biomedical industry in the world. It then suggests the ways to make the transformation by filling the gap between basic research and commercial products and cultivating the necessary business environment for biomedical drugs in China.

SO LAW & POLICY
AB The recent shift in state policies from Keynesianism to neoliberalism was accompanied by a transformation in state structures. The case of trade liberalization in the United States reveals that this structural transformation is of a judicial nature. In 1974, supporters of free trade successfully shifted authority over the management of protectionist claims from Congress to quasi-judicial bodies in the U. S. executive; in 1994, they successfully strengthened the dispute settlement mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. This judicial transformation indicates a shift from sites where decisions are made by way of political negotiations to sites where judges preside over legal disputes. In the article, I identify the political origins of these judicial transformations and discuss the factors that make judicial sites more favorable to neoliberal policies than political sites.

The Jean Chretien Pledge to Africa Act 2004 (Canada) provides authorisation for the export of pharmaceutical drugs from Canada to developing countries to address public health epidemics. The EU has issued draft regulations governing the export of pharmaceutical drugs. A number of European countries, including Norway, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland, are seeking to pass domestic legislation to give force to the WTO General Council Decision. Australia has shown little initiative in seeking to implement such international agreements dealing with access to essential medicines. it is argued that Australia should implement humanitarian legislation to embody the WTO General Council Decision, emulating models in Canada, Norway and the EU. ideally, there should be no 'right of first refusal', the list of pharmaceutical drugs should be open-ended, and the eligible importing countries should not be limited to members of the WTO.

TI The effectiveness of fisheries subsidies as a trade policy tool to
   achieving sustainable development goals at the WTO
SO MARINE POLICY
AB At the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Argentina, despite being steadfast in achieving an outcome on fisheries subsidies disciplines, member countries were unable to reach consensus on the matter. While members of the WTO have been advocating for sustainable management of fisheries resources and advocating the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6, some developing countries were concerned about its impact on low income and poorly resourced fishers, who are surviving because of the subsidies under the discipline. This study provides possible implications of the fisheries subsidies as a trade policy tool for market access and its effectiveness in achieving the overall sustainable development goals. To examine the effectiveness of subsidies in fisheries negotiations, the study focuses on the global supply and demand side of the fisheries resources from the perspective of the fish resource holders and the fishing resource capacity. The analysis considers budgetary support in fisheries, the vessel capacity (tonnage), the fish development technologies and the total marine catch processing, to indicate the demand for extraction of the fish resources. The supply of the fish resources is determined by the regions with major fishing areas and the licenses issued for fishing. Using both the market demand and supply for fisheries resource extraction, the study examines the effectiveness of subsidies as a trade policy tool to attain the overall sustainable development goals. Based on the analysis, certain policy strategies follows, which are Important for countries to consider before the elimination of fisheries subsidies at the WTO.

TI The TRIPS Agreement as a Coercive Threat: Estimating the Effects of
   Trade Ties on IPR Protection Regimes
SO GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL
AB Negotiators from developed countries pushed hard for the inclusion of the TRIPS Agreement in the WTO set of agreements because it was viewed as a potentially effective method of coercing developing countries to strengthen their protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). We investigate whether the threat of cross-agreement retaliation, which could be authorized in disputes regarding the TRIPS Agreement, is effective in changing countries' IPR protection regimes. The results from a panel empirical model suggest that both the TRIPS Agreement and the strength of trade ties with developed countries are important determinants of IPR protection regimes, but the vulnerability to potential trade losses through cross-agreement retaliation is not a uniformly significant determinant across geo-economic regions. These results extend beyond the TRIPS Agreement and highlight the potential ineffectiveness of the WTO's retaliation mechanism as a coercive threat.

TI Forum Shopping and Fairness in Mexico-United States Trade Disputes
SO LATIN AMERICAN POLICY
AB Of all the countries in Latin America, Mexico has the strongest economic ties to the United States, formalized by the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, but this Agreement does not preclude Mexico from targeting the United States in the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Mechanism. In fact, the Agreement's dispute-settlement system encourages it to do so if the complaint at hand is to have a fair consideration. The North American Free Trade Agreement's dispute-resolution system goes to a board containing representatives from the three-member countries, which includes by default the complainant state and the defendant state. Therefore, even though Mexico has the closest economic relationship with the United States of the Latin American states considered in this project, it is also the most likely to target the United States in the World Trade Organization. This article focuses on how trade ties constrain Mexico's use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism against its largest trade partner.

TI TRADE POLICY SPACE AND EXPORT PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This paper provides a quantitative measure of the concept of trade policy space, at the macroeconomic level, and examines its impact on export product diversification. Trade policy space has been defined as the room of manoeuvre available to a government once its current trade policy is depurated from the impact of structural domestic and international factors. The analysis has been carried out using an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 165 countries (both developed and developing countries) over the period 2002-2015. Results suggest that trade policy space is positively associated with export product diversification, and the higher countries' development level, the greater is the magnitude of the positive effect of trade policy space on export product diversification. The analysis further shows for recipient-countries of Aid for Trade (AfT) flows that trade policy space is complementary with AfT inflows in inducing export product diversification. In particular, the higher the amounts of AfT inflows that accrue to these countries, the greater is the positive impact of trade policy space on export product diversification in AfT recipient-countries.

TI Agricultural Trade: What Matters in the Doha Round?
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 4
SE Annual Review of Resource Economics
AB This survey concludes that including agriculture in the negotiations was particularly important economically. Although agricultural exports are less than 10% of merchandise trade, the high and variable protection in this sector appears to account for the majority of the cost of distortions in global merchandise trade. Within agriculture, most of the costs appear to arise from trade barriers levied on imports, because these barriers tend to be high and variable across products and over time and are levied by many countries that do not use subsidies. The diverse interests of participants resulted in very complex proposals and a tendency for countries to focus on the political costs of an agreement, rather than on the potential economic benefits. The negotiations faced a need for balance between discipline in reducing tariffs and flexibility in managing political pressures. Although the approach of providing flexibilities on a certain percentage of tariff lines is seriously flawed, the proposed modalities still appear to provide worthwhile market access. There need to be better ways of dealing with developing countries' concerns about food price volatility while reducing the collective-action problems resulting from price insulation.

TI Back to the future: 'retro' trade governance and the future of the
   multilateral order
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB This article reflects on the role crises play in enabling existing systems of global economic governance to evolve and endure while also preserving underlying power dynamics. The article uses global trade governance as its case-study. Its aim is to explore the impact of the negotiating crises that beset the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha round of trade negotiations. The article traces how, over the course of the Doha round, periodic crises resulting from divergent pressures for opposing outcomes combined to preclude one set of institutional developments from resulting (those on which the Doha round had been launched and the basis upon which developing countries negotiated) while enabling others (those advanced by the leading industrial states). The result has been to usher in changes that have returned global trade governance to a form of system management more familiar to observers of the multilateral trading system of the 1970s. This 'retro' form of trade governance signals a departure from the more inclusive system that had emerged from the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and evolved during the WTO's early years, replacing it with a lither system of mini-lateralism more fit for industrial country purposes.

TI Market structure, imperfect tariff pass-through, and household welfare
   in Urban China
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper investigates the tariff pass-through mechanism and the distributional effects of trade liberalization in urban China. We study how market structure, specifically the size of the private sector, affects tariff pass-through, and how this mechanism influenced the extent to which households benefited from the trade liberalization. Our results suggest that a higher share of private sector in Chinese cities is associated with higher levels of tariff pass through rates. This effect works both through the distribution sector, and through the production of final goods. By incorporating the changes in consumer prices of tradable and non-tradable goods, we next investigate the impact of WTO accession on household welfare through changes in the cost of consumption. The results show that WTO accession of China was associated with welfare gains to almost every household across the per capita expenditure spectrum, and that the distributional effect is strongly pro-poor. The average welfare gain of WTO accession on Chinese households is estimated to be 7.3%. The distributional effect through higher levels of privatization was also pro-poor, indicating that privatization enhanced the pro-poor impact of trade liberalization. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI The precautionary principle and other non-tariff barriers to free and
   fair international food trade
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION
AB International food trade and world population are growing rapidly. National legislation has been enacted and implemented in many countries to assure good quality and safe foods to meet increased demand. No country is fully self-sufficient in domestic food production to meet population demands, and all require some food imports. Current international food trade agreements call for free and fair food trade between all countries, developed and developing. National food legislation and food production, processing and marketing systems have evolved in most countries to ensure better quality and safer foods. At the international level the work of the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) and the World Trade Organization Agreements on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and related Uruguay Round agreements have been agreed to by over 140 countries with the aim to promoting the free and fair trade of good quality and safe foods between all countries. The SPS and TBT agreements rely on science-based Codex standards, guidelines, and recommendations as benchmarks for judging international food trade disputes. A number of non-tariff barriers to trade, often related to agricultural subsidies and other food trade payments in developed countries, continue to give rise to complaints to WTO. They also continue to prevent free and fair trade, particularly for developing countries in international food trade. A number of these non-tariff barriers to trade are briefly examined, along with other domestic and international food trade problems, and recommendations for improvements are made.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB This article examines the key issues that electronic commerce poses for global trade, using as a starting point the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement most relevant to electronic commerce. It begins with an overview of electronic commerce, providing a workable definition of electronic commerce and examining its growth and economic impact. It then discusses the important function played by the WTO in electronic commerce, and the central role of GATS in that function. The article goes on to consider the compatibility between electronic commerce and global trade at three levels: first, at the textual level of GATS, providing recommendations to improve the treatment of electronic commerce within that agreement; secondly, at the structural level of the WTO agreements, proposing an integration of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and GATS to deal better with electronic commerce under the WTO regime; and thirdly, at the level of the global trading system, exploring how recognition of electronic commerce as a global public good may help reduce the digital divide between developed and developing countries.

However, a major difference between the past and the present intra-regional trade agreements is that the latter should play a major role in the GATT's members' efforts to improve their international position, rather than in their developing an inward-oriented trade policy. This paper aims to answer the questions of whether the coexistence between regional blocs and the multilateral trading system is of a short- or a long-term nature; to what extent the current Arab trade blocs, especially the GCC and the larger Arab Free Trade Area, comply with the requirements of the WTO's provisions; finally, what are the necessities and the requirements of an outward Arab economic bloc under the ongoing global change.

   'Reciprocity' and 'Special and Differential Treatment' for Developing
   Countries within the WTO System
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW
AB The international trade regime embodied in the World Trade Organization (WTO) goes beyond a collection of texts and agreements. As legal rules are not immune to political and economical influences, they have to be analysed in the context in which they have been created and constantly modified. Nowadays, the multilateral system of the WTO gains complexity when the market place does not restrict its subject to goods anymore and when the goal of development is materialized, in its agreements, as one of the pillars of the WTO. Developing countries, empowered by the launch of their economic growth, are acquiring space and voice to criticize the legal framework of the WTO, saying it has not been entirely coherent with its own objectives and claiming for the adoption of an effective Special and Differential Treatment (SDT). On the other hand, developed countries, based on their economic superiority and underlining the importance of free trade through liberalization policies, insist on the necessity of reciprocal commitments to promote economic growth and global welfare. This dilemma is traduced in the impasse of the recent Doha Round, but it is already time for more ideas to be brought and paradoxes to be resolved. The current challenge faced in this study becomes then to conciliate the SDT, Reciprocity the development concerns. At the end, preferential systems do not go against liberalization. Instead, the SDT intends to graduate the liberalization process through fairness (development) and to enable, only afterwards, that seriously discussions regarding free trade and Reciprocity can be held regarding their full or, more plausibly, partial implementation.

In this context, a multilateral investment agreement ("MIA") has been called for as a global effort to address the global backlash. Arguably, the current condition for a MM might be more favorable than before, as the interests of developed countries and developing countries have changed. After examining the need of a MM for the global backlash, this paper attempts to explore China's recent practice in this aspect, including that (1) China's changing interest in outward foreign direct investment and investment treaty practice reflect the changing landscape of international investment law; (2) the 2016 G20 under China's presidency achieved the Guiding Principles for Global Investment Policymaking; and (3) China has joined to work on a multilateral framework on investment facilitation at the WTO.

TI Toward a More Rounded Strategy to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco
   Products
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The tobacco epidemic poses one of the gravest public health threats to both developed and developing countries. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), while aiming to address the issue through various regulatory measures, has created many friction points with other treaty regimes - international trade, intellectual property, and investment. In particular, the tension between the FCTC and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has received much scholar attention. However, the existing literature focuses largely on reconciling public health measures and WTO rules applicable to legal trade in tobacco products. An equally important issue has been left out -illicit trade. Illegally manufactured, distributed, and sold tobacco amounts to 650 billion cigarettes annually - over 12% of the global total. Illicit tobacco trade has exacerbated the tobacco epidemic and undermined the effectiveness of price and tax measures. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (Protocol) was adopted under the FCTC to strengthen supply chain controls, establish legal liabilities, and facilitate international cooperation. However, issues such as supply chain complexity, surreptitious nature, and industry involvement have been overlooked in the negotiation stage. This article therefore examines such factors in depth and identifies two missing governance tools - a notification system and a whistleblower mechanism - to close the loophole, facilitate implementation, and strengthen the global regulatory strategy.

TI Murky trade waters: Regional tariff commitments and non-tariff measures
   in Africa
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB In several African regions, economic integration has successfully reduced tariff protection by freezing the opportunity to raise applied tariffs against fellow integration partners above those promised. We examine whether these regional tariff commitments have come at the expense of adverse side-effects on the prevalence of non-tariff trade barriers. Comparing the effects of applied tariff overhangs - the difference between MFN bound tariffs and effectively applied tariffs - towards all vis-a-vis African trading partners on SPS and TBT notifications of 35 African WTO members from 2001-2017, we find no general relationship between tariff overhangs and import regulation in our preferred model setting. Larger tariff overhangs specific to intra-African trade relations, however, increase the probability of SPS measures and TBT and thereby contrast with the common assumption of the former functioning as a flexible policy valve. We see the nature of Africa's formal trade relations as an explanation for these findings. While regional tariff commitments have not only significantly moved African countries away from multilateral commitments, they have also sharply reduced their tariff policy space within Africa, thus seemingly leaving regulatory policy as one of the few legitimate options to level the playing field with the by far closest market competitors.

SO LEGAL ISSUES OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
AB Since the 1970s anti-dumping has gained prominence in international trade law. Not only have anti-dumping measures proliferated hut many new anti-dumping users have emerged, including developing countries. However, the limited negotiating mandate of the WTO's Doha Round indicates that anti-dumping law will remain unchanged for years to come. In seeking ways to reverse these trends, this study explores the possibility of constraining the use of the anti-dumping instrument through existing laws. It approaches this objective by examining the relationship between the WTO's specialized anti-dumping laws and the GATT's core non-discrimination rule, the MFN principle. It concludes that the application of the MFN discipline within the anti-dumping context is mandated by WTO law and that such application offers a viable path to advance the anti-dumping law discourse beyond its traditional understanding.

The results suggest that WTO has failed to increase the growth pace of value of world dairy trade and to reduce the world dairy markets volatility. The study finds that global dairy trade has been dominated by developed countries. Developed countries are net dairy exporters. Conversely, developing and least developed countries are net dairy importers. During post-WTO phase, least developed countries' dairy trade deficit has expanded significantly. Developing world has been the largest producer as well as consumer of dairy products. Given thinness and increasing volatility of world dairy markets, it would be prudent for developing countries to increase the investment in dairy industry for enhancing the growth pace of dairy production to meet their faster growing demand.

TI Addressing Tied Aid: Towards a More Development-Oriented WTO?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB 'Tied aid' refers to aid granted by one country or countries to another on condition that the goods or services acquired are purchased from the donor(s). Despite the fact that tying aid seems contrary to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) basic principles of free trade and is an important issue for developing countries, it has received little attention from scholars or practitioners, even during the current 'development round' of negotiations. This article fills a gap in the literature by elaborating the way in which tied aid in relation to goods is affected by WTO rules. The analysis reveals that the WTO Agreements give little specific attention to the issue and that practices relating to tied aid are either outside the WTO rules or covered only in a limited or uncertain way such that the rules have little practical impact. Given the importance of tied aid for trade and for the WTO's development agenda, the analysis thus indicates that tied aid is an area requiring future consideration in the WTO. The analysis also serves to elucidate the complex legal architecture of the WTO Agreements as they relate to tied aid, which is important for any future efforts to address this subject.

TI China in the WTO Twenty Years On: How to Mend a Broken Relationship?
SO GERMAN LAW JOURNAL
AB China's participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been a rollercoaster of milestones and frictions. China has emerged as a leading trading nation, which has contributed to the expansion of world trade. Some of its trading partners, however, and most vocally the United States, complain that China has reached its new status by eluding its WTO commitments. Under President Trump, the United States reacted strongly against China, almost bringing the WTO (but not China!) to its knees. These actions have been criticized in different ways: Some underline their unilateral character (and the ensuing legal issues they raise), whereas others focus on the regime-neutrality of the WTO, which should, in principle, be able to accommodate Western liberal democracies, developing countries, and socialist countries like China equally. In this short Article, we argue that staying idle is no solution to the China issue and that addressing it through unilateral actions is no solution either. Both approaches would only deepen the current WTO crisis. In our view, the only viable solution for the WTO system requires adding new disciplines to the existing multilateral rules.

TI Balancing, Threats & Wedges in International Political Economy: The
   Origins and Impact of the Sino-Indian Alliance at the WTO
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA
AB Despite considerable tensions, China and India formed a surprising alliance at the WTO. Their alliance proved highly successful, bringing an end to American dominance and sharply curtailing the ability of the US to set the rules of global trade. However, the article shows, a key risk of soft balancing within an international institution is that, if successful, it may cause the dominant power to abandon the institution altogether. The US responded to China and India's soft balancing by turning away from the WTO, actively undermining its rules and enforcement mechanism, and pursuing its interests through bilateral channels. The article thus identifies a distinct and previously unrecognized wedge strategy-vertical forum-shifting, or moving the action from international institutions to bilateral negotiations, to split an adversary coalition.

TI If one size doesn't fit all, what does? Rethinking special and
   differential treatment in the World Trade Organization
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Although the Doha declaration, launching the current multilateral trade negotiations, puts special and differential treatment (SDT) at its core, negotiations have made no progress. This Bulletin explains why SDT is central to the creation of development-friendly trade rules and has become more necessary since the World Trade Organization (WTO) was created. This is because dispute settlement is now binding. Differences could be accommodated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) through ex post fudging. The problems experienced with the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) demonstrates what can go wrong and why ex ante agreement is now required. There are many ways in which differentiation can be incorporated into the Doha Round. The key requirement is that it should provide actionable modulations that address the development issue involved. This has strong implications for research, which must be issue and country-specific. It also implies that, while there is a place for WTO- and Agreement-wide statements of principle and for modulations within each country's national schedules, to be effective some SDT will need to be limited to sub-groups of developing countries.

We begin with an account of the meeting that offers an insight into the 'colour' of these biennial gatherings. The article then identifies and explores the primary consequences of pursuing an agenda designed not to focus on the core issues in the Doha Round but instead to ensure that the meeting is a 'success'. Here we draw attention to the increasingly problematic nature of the Round's 'development' content, the thorny issue of agricultural liberalization and the problems posed for developing countries when their industrial counterparts pursue trade objectives through regional and bilateral means. In the concluding section, we consider the way forward for both the Doha Round and the WTO as an institution.

TI Asbestos poisons World Trade Organization atmosphere
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB In September 2000, a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel published its findings in the dispute between Canada and the European Union/France over France's ban on the import and use of chrysotile (white asbestos). The panel upheld the French ban, established that the use of chrysotile is a health risk and the idea of "controlled use" a fallacy, and used (for the first time) an exception clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that pen-nits trade restrictive measures to protect human life or health. At the same time, the panel concluded that the French ban violated international trade laws by treating chrysotile products less favorably than domestically produced alternatives. Some WTO watchers believe that with asbestos as the precedent for bans on toxic substances, the regulation of other, much less well-established, toxic exposures could prove much more difficult. Now the French ban has been upheld, chrysotile producers will increasingly target developing countries. Canada is appealing the WTO decision.

TI Trade and the environment with pre-existing subsidies: A dynamic general
   equilibrium analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB Countries that wish to erect trade barriers have a variety of instruments at their disposal. In addition to tariffs and quotas, countries can offer tax relief, low interest financing, reduced regulation, and other subsidies to domestic industries facing foreign competition. In a trade agreement, countries typically agree to reduce not only tariffs but also subsidies. We consider the effect of a free trade agreement on pollution emissions. We show that while reducing tariffs may indeed increase output and pollution, reductions in some subsides required by the trade agreement reduce pollution in general equilibrium for reasonable parameter values. Reducing subsidies has three effects on pollution: (1) reducing subsidies to firms reduces pollution-causing capital accumulation, (2) if subsidized firms are more pollution intensive, then reducing subsides moves capital and labor from more to less pollution intensive firms, and (3) reducing subsidies concentrates production in more productive firms, increasing output and thus pollution. We derive straightforward conditions for which (1) and (2) outweigh (3). We then calibrate the model to China in 1997, and find that pollution has a more elastic response to reducing subsidies than to reducing tariffs. While a 5% reduction in tariffs increases all pollutants by approximately 1%, a 5% reduction in subsidies reduces pollution by 1.8-11.6%, depending on the pollutant. The reductions in pollution occur without any environmental side agreements or abatement policy changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Patent protection in developing countries and global welfare: WTO
   obligations versus flexibilities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper develops a North-South model to evaluate the South's incentive for patent protection when a Northern firm's investment in quality-enhancing research and development (R&D) is affected by its patent policy. The model is used to (a) evaluate the impact of requiring the South to fulfill its key WTO obligation of instituting patent protection and (b) to address the role of two major flexibilities that wro members enjoy with respect to their patent policies: the freedom to implement exhaustion policies of their choosing and the right to use compulsory licensing (CL) subject to certain stipulations. Two forces drive the model: how much the firm invests in R&D and whether or not selling in the South maximizes its global profit. CL improves consumer access in the South and can even raise innovation and global welfare. Provided the South implements patent protection, innovation and welfare are higher if the North follows national as opposed to international exhaustion. However, the South's incentive for patent protection is not necessarily stronger under national exhaustion. Not only is CL more likely to be used under international exhaustion, the welfare gain resulting from its application is also higher relative to that under national exhaustion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
CT 3rd Annual Conference on Preparing the Doha Development Round
CY JUL 02, 2004
CL Florence, ITALY
AB There are large differences between WTO Members in terms of resource capacity constraints and national trade policy and investment priorities. These affect the ability and willingness to incur the costs associated with implementation of new rules, as well as the net benefits of doing so. The 'adjustment burden' of new rules mostly will fall on developing countries, as such rules will reflect the status quo in industrialized countries ('best practice'). This paper discusses options that have been proposed to address country differences and increase the 'development relevance' of the WTO. These include shifting back to a club approach, more explicit special and differential treatment provisions in specific WTO agreements, and a concerted effort to establish a mechanism in the WTO where development concerns can be considered. A case is made for the latter - involving a serious effort to increase the transparency of applied policies, including assessments of their effectiveness and the magnitude of any negative spillovers imposed on other developing countries.

TI Implementing WTO rules through negotiations and sanctions: The role of
   trade policy review mechanism and dispute settlement system
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB Based on economic and legal perspectives, this Article aims to analyze how the World Trade Organization ("WTO") combines negotiations and sanctions to ensure the implementation of its law. While the Trade Policy Review mechanism ("TPR") at the WTO deals with the WTO-compatibility of the trade policy of a particular member in question, the prevalence of such policies can be successfully challenged at the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") which makes decisions on trade disputes between governments that are adjudicated by the WTO. The TPR can play a major role in this framework, providing developing and less-developed countries valuable input on the WTO-compatibility of their trade partners. This article intends to analyze whether any relationship exists between TPR findings and the outcome of cases lodged at the DSB. To do that, this analysis uses an empirical method involving five countries. Our sample consists of two developing countries-Brazil and India-and three developed countries-the European Community ("EC"), Japan, and the United States. The Article shows that many issues raised by the TPRs of selected members have been successfully challenged at the WTO, as a result of which areas of concern have been rectified in the subsequent period. The Article concludes that while the WTO is clearly able to ensure a satisfactory enforcement of its laws in national legal orders and to influence national trade policies, the system still needs some improvement.

CL Rajecke Teplice, SLOVAKIA
SP Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ & Transport & Commun, Dept Econ
AB One of the consequences of the socioeconomic phenomenon of globalization is the increasing use of preferential trade agreements to regulate the international trade relations. In this context, one of the directions of the EU's Common Commercial Policy towards the third countries in the last ten years has been the promotion of international trade with the rapidly developing countries of the BRICS region. For this reason, as early as in 2006, EU and India have launched the negotiations on signing a mutual preferential (free trade) agreement, which is continuing up to this day. It is obvious that such agreement could help to diversify the structure of EU's international trade, especially when trade relations with the more traditional trading partners (such as Russia) are becoming more problematic due to political disputes and sanctions. Therefore, the article seeks to answer the question what are the specific practical regulatory problems currently facing the international trade operators engaged in international trade business between the EU Member States and India and how they can be reflected/solved in the possible free trade agreement between them? To answer this question, the article discusses specific practical trade regulation issues in the last decade (since 2006), which are identified based on a case study of trade disputes between the EU and India on the World Trade Organization (WTO) level, EU level and national level of the EU Member States (using the Republic of Lithuania as the main example).

TI Moving the G20's investment agenda forward

AB This article argues that it is of paramount importance that the G20 pays attention to the mounting challenges faced by the international investment regime. This is all the more important because international investment is crucial to advance sustainable development, especially in developing countries. For both immediate and long-term reasons, investment policies should therefore be a core item on the agenda of the G20 and the Trade and Investment Working Group in particular. The present article makes two sets of recommendations: first, the G20 should continue its work on international investment policy reform and initiate steps to operationalise the Guiding Principles for Global Investment Policymaking; second, the G20 should support ongoing WTO discussions on investment facilitation suggesting that they should aim not only at facilitating more foreign direct investment (FDI), but sustainable FDI. The policy recommendations provide an input for the Japanese G20 presidency in 2019.

TI Inputs, networks and quality-upgrading: Evidence from China in India
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This paper exploits China's accession to the WTO to investigate the impact of a supply shock on quality across the Indian production network. After controlling for increased import competition, including in downstream and third-country markets, and for new export opportunities, we find that a fall in input tariffs raises revenue, quality and prices, whilst lowering quality-adjusted prices and the probability of product exit - consistent with a simple model of multi-product manufacturers gaining access to higher-quality components. Upgrading persists for at least ten years; at the peak in 2010, products with a 10% higher pre-accession input tariff, and hence a larger post-accession fall in tariffs, have 5.3% higher quality. This in turn raises quality further down the supply chain, with input-output linkages amplifying the one-step effect by up to 75%. These results highlight a potential beneficial impact of the "China shock" in developing countries, namely supply-driven quality upgrading.

Baseline projections until 2040 are generated with the WTO Global Trade Model, a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. With the modelled structural changes, the Chinese economy is projected to reorient its focus increasingly onto the domestic economy, raising the share of private household and government consumption in GDP, turning China's trade surplus into a trade deficit, reducing China's share in global exports, raising the share of services in both production and exports, shifting the destination markets of Chinese exports from developed to developing countries, and changing its pattern of comparative advantage away from sectors like light and heavy manufacturing to electronic and machinery equipment. The large bilateral trade surplus vis-a-vis the United States is projected to fall to almost zero.

TI Toward a global perspective on farm animal welfare
SO APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
AB During the past half century, the less industrialized countries experienced rapid increases in animal production through both large-scale confinement systems and traditional small-scale systems. These countries now produce the majority of the world's meat. The regulations and other programs designed to safeguard animal welfare in the European and English-speaking countries may prove ineffective in the diverse and burgeoning production systems of the less industrialized nations. However, improvements to animal welfare may still be achieved (1) through the basic economic incentive to reduce losses caused by injury, stress and malnutrition, (2) through disease control programs, as long as these are well conducted, and (3) by international corporations applying their existing animal welfare standards on a more global basis. Moreover, low labour costs in less industrialized countries could allow labour-intensive, non-confinement systems to flourish, especially if there is an international market for such products. Although animal welfare plays no role in the agreements of the World Trade Organization, internationally recognized standards may still be incorporated by mutual agreement in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, and they may be required in future by international food companies and their customers. There are important opportunities for animal welfare scientists to support animal protection initiatives in the less industrialized countries, especially through technical assistance programs. research and education.

TI Globalization, pharmaceutical pricing, and South African health policy:
   Managing confrontation with US firms and politicians
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB Brewing since the advent of South African democracy in 1994 and promises of health sector transformation, an extraordinary drug war between President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress government and U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers took on global proportions in 1998-1999. Within months of the passage of South African legislation aimed at lowering drug prices, the U.S. government quickly applied powerful pressure points to repeal a clause allowing potential importation of generic substitutes and imposition of compulsory licensing. At stake were not only local interpretations of patent law and World Trade Organization rules on Trade in Intellectual Property, but international power relations between developing countries and the pharmaceutical industry. In reviewing the ongoing debate, this article considers post-apartheid public health policy, U.S. government pressure to change the law, and pharmaceutical industry interests and links to the U.S. government, and evaluates various kinds of resistance to U.S. corporate and government behavior. The case thus raises-not for the first time-concerns about contemporary imperialism ("globalization"), the role of the profit motive as an incentive in vital pharmaceutical products, and indeed the depth of "democracy" in a country where high-bidding international drug firms have sufficient clout to embarrass Vice President Al Gore by pining him against the life-and-death interests of millions of consumers of essential drugs in South Africa and other developing countries.

TI Governing Cross-Border Data Flows: International Trade Agreements and
   Their Limits
SO LAWS
AB In modern international competition and cooperation, digital trade rules centered on the cross-border flow of data have become a competitive advantage for countries. Under the guidance of commercial freedom, the United States chooses to actively promote the free flow of data across borders. The European Union has placed the protection of personal data rights before the cross-border flow of data through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and developing countries generally reserve space for industry policy interpretation. As one of the world's largest economies, facing the needs of domestic industrial development and the pressure of international systems, China's cross-border data flows' policy is to ensure data flows under the premise of security, protection of personal information, seek international coordination of rules, and the freedom of transmission. The key question, therefore, is how to facilitate interoperability or find a middle ground among the divergent approaches in order to avoid the fragmentation of the digital trade system. The article suggests that a thin and narrowly scoped WTO agreement on e-commerce rules on cross-border data flows with sufficient policy space to accommodate different needs, policy preferences and priorities, and local contexts via legitimate exception provisions would be a welcome movement.

TI The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement: Form without Substance Again?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement provides flexibility for Developing Members by allowing them to accept only the legal obligations they attach as "schedules" - as the schedules attached to a tariff agreement. The possibility that Developed Members can induce broad acceptance by Developing Members through reciprocal negotiation is compromised by Developed Members not having the flexibility of attaching schedules they must accept all of the disciplines of the agreement. Inducing broad acceptance by Developing Members through the provision of assistance (i.e., paying Developing Members to do so) is compromised by the agreement not bringing the provision of assistance within its legal obligations. The agreement thus fails to bring reciprocity to bear on the acceptance of discipline over trade controls and fails to give operational content within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) legal system to the provision of assistance to developing countries. conclude that it is another example of the "form without substance" (Robert Hudec's earlier conclusion) that has characterized the GATT/WTO system's relations with developing countries since its beginning.

TI CLIMATE POLICY AND BORDER ADJUSTMENT REGULATION: DESIGNING A COHERENT
   RESPONSE
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB The Australian Government's Clean Energy Legislative Package includes the legislative infrastructure for a carbon tax which came into full effect in July 2012. Although the legislation is comprehensive, we argue that it lacks a mechanism that adequately deals with the competing policy objectives of: (a) achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; (b) not impairing national economic growth; and (c) ensuring that international obligations regarding response measures, such as a carbon tax, do not adversely affect developing countries. The potential policy frictions between these objectives might have been reduced had the Government included a well-known trade mechanism which could have provided a more coherent interface for these competing policy objectives. That mechanism is the 'border tax adjustment'. This paper explores a range of misunderstandings surrounding the use of border tax adjustments, which may well explain why they were not implemented. Furthermore, this paper will explain how, if properly understood, border tax adjustments could make a significant contribution to a consistent climate policy that balances the competing concerns of climate change, trade, economic and developmental policy objectives.

Parliamentarians' views of alternative mechanisms for ensuring parliamentary control of the WTO tend to vary by jurisdiction. From a positive perspective, these views reflect power structures at the national, regional, and international levels, as well as parliamentarians' experiences with supranational governance institutions. European political representatives are more accustomed to shared supranational governance institutions. They tend to propose expansion and adaptation of the EU model to address global governance challenges. US congressional representatives, in contrast, tend to be wary of how US 'sovereignty' and US power can be constrained through the WTO or any other global governance regime. They tend to oppose adding a parliamentary dimension. From a normative perspective, in order to meaningfully discuss WTO accountability we need a conceptual framework that permits us to assess the tradeoffs between different mechanisms for ensuring oversight, including parliamentary oversight, of the WTO. This article adopts a comparative institutional one. The article addresses the policy arguments for and against the addition of such a parliamentary dimension to the WTO and examines some of the many institutional challenges that would arise. The article maintains that the creation of a WTO parliamentary body should be judged in terms of its impact on the participation of less powerful stakeholders and, in particular of developing countries and their constituents, relative to other institutional alternatives.

TI The biofuels landscape: Is there a role for the WTO?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB The International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council (IPC) has recently called on the WTO to clarify its rules on biofuels. It called for a resolution of the customs classifications problems surrounding these fuels so that trade could flourish in an organized manner. More specifically it argued that uncertainty over the biofuels customs classification, and the range of governmental measures to protect domestic biofuel production, including tariffs and subsidies, risked stunting growth in trade even as the global demand for biofuels was rising. For the IPC-as wen as for numerous actors on the biofuels landscape an examination of how WTO rules apply to these fuels has clearly become timely.(2)
   This article seeks to draw attention to the multiple policy objectives that are driving governments to promote biofuels, and to how "trade policy" is largely being put to the service of the specific goals to which governments are attaching priority. It argues that a coherent vision at the international level of the role that biofuels should play in energy, economic and environmental policy has yet to emerge, but that despite this situation it is key that this sector develops on a "level trade policy playing field" for its long-term efficiency. Such a levelling would, in particular, unleash the full comparative advantage of tropical developing country producers of ethanol. The article highlights that-even in the absence of a concerted decision by governments on how to handle these fuels at the WTO-certain restrictions to biofuels trade would in any event be reduced through the current Doha Round of trade negotiations. But for the Doha Round to bear full fruit, it would be important for governments not to fully shelter either biofuels, or their production feedstock, through existing "flexibilities" in the negotiations.

TI Differential Treatment and Inequalities under the Sustainable
   Development Goals: Beyond Preferential Market Access
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB Reducing inequality in its multiple dimensions is key to sustainability. Under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, one way to meet the goal of narrowing gaps between and within countries is by implementing the special and differential treatment (SDT) principle. The most concrete and well-established implementation of this principle within international trade law is through the Enabling Clause, which authorizes wealthy States to grant, under specified conditions, preferential market access to select developing countries. Yet commentators, consisting primarily of economists and developing-country representatives, argue that tariff preferences are often inadequate to grow the economies of many in the Global South, much less to reduce inequalities. A legal perspective that could bolster this argument remains sparse. This article fills said gap by explaining that while international trade law operationalizes the SDT principle with a heavy emphasis on tariff preferences, the principle is additionally expressed in several other provisions under the other World Trade Organization (WTO) covered agreements: Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade; Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; Agreement on Trade Facilitation. These under-studied provisions demonstrate crucial but overlooked aspects of the SDT principle, namely, capacity-building and international assistance and cooperation. Therefore, critically analyzing these provisions is important to ascertain whether and how implementation of the SDT principle can reduce inequalities and support sustainable development. This legal analysis contributes in two ways to the broader inquiry about the role of international trade law in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First, on a practical level, the article suggests legal bases or sources for additional indicators needed to better measure and monitor progress in reaching the target. Second, the analysis reveals a necessity to revisit and further scrutinize assumptions underlying the legal mechanisms within the trade regime that States and other relevant actors are using to pursue valuable global objectives.

TI Present stakes around patent political economy: Legal and economic
   lessons from the pharmaceutical patent rights in India
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
AB The Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime adopted by any country is essentially a tool that strives to ensure both the growth of the domestic pharmaceutical industry and people's access to medicines. But, contrary to the very easily advanced theory, there is no paradox between the two. From this perspective, the Indian experience has shown that it is precisely the relaxation of its national IPR regime that promoted the growth of its domestic industry, thereby ensuring a better patient access to medicines. However, the globalisation process does not overlook any sector, which means that medicines too are submitted to the new legal framework established within the WTO. To understand better the stakes involved in the ratification of the TRIPS agreement in India, this paper addresses several issues. It begins by establishing that opting for the intellectual property regime is not without consequences. It determines the extent of progress achieved in the industrial and health sectors both in the developed as well as developing countries. Then, it analyses how the TRIPS agreement establishes a strong IPR system that aims to reconcile protection of innovation and public health. promotion by providing for "exceptions" at the global level. Finally, after having dealt in detail with Indian reticence and tardiness in making its legislation TRIPS compatible, the paper presents the prospects available presently for India.

TI Is it in China's interest to implement an export carbon tax?
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Considering the dual context of China's domestic willingness to have a cleaner export structure and the widespread concern among developed countries that carbon leakage from developing countries, particularly China, could threaten their own climate policy effectiveness; this paper uses the SICGE model to investigate the economic rationale of taxing direct CO2 emissions of export in China. With an export carbon tax set at 200 yuan/t CO2, three policy scenarios were studied, where the tax revenue is: undistributed; redistributed neutrally to stimulate investment; and redistributed neutrally to stimulate consumption. According to the model, the economic and climate effects of the different policy scenarios are not particularly distinguishable. The economic impacts are slightly negative while the effect on the export structure is significant: the export of major energy-intensive products decreased and the export of certain sectors (labour-intensive or with higher value-added) increased, resulting in a cut of 3.77% in total direct CO2 emissions from exports. The revenue redistribution to stimulate consumption is shown to be the optimal scenario choice, which was confirmed by further sensitivity tests. By reviewing related WTO laws, this paper concludes that a clearly designed export carbon tax with a comparable carbon price is in China's own interest, while lessening the carbon leakage concerns of developed countries.

TI The effects of governance changes on bank efficiency in China: A
   stochastic distance function approach
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB China has accelerated banking reform since joining the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001. Employing a stochastic distance function approach, this paper examines bank technical efficiency and differentiates the static, selection and dynamic governance effects on bank efficiency for the 11-year period 1995-2005. The results show that bank efficiency has improved. Joint-stock ownership is associated with better performance in terms of profitability than state ownership (static effect). Strong selection effects are found for both foreign acquisition and going public reform strategies. Foreign acquisition may benefit domestic banks by efficiency gains in the long run, but privatization via initial public offerings (IPOs) appears to have only some short-term effects.

TI Building on the Canadian approach to resolve the stalemate on the trade
   and environment agenda in the World Trade Organization
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the competing views on the link between trade and environment in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and come up with a proposal that better clarifies the scope of legality of environmentally motivated unilateral trade measures in the multilateral trading system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a doctrinal approach to legal research in providing an exegesis on the various efforts towards the integration of trade and environment in the WTO framework.
   Findings - Employing the theory of transnational social justice as its analytical tool, the paper suggests that a state contemplating the use of environmentally motivated unilateral trade measures first extend positive measures to the communities in other states that are affected by the purported measure. Accordingly, it argues that unilateral trade measures are allowed in the system only as a last resort and only if their application runs congruent to the values and objectives recognized by the system.
   Originality/value - It is hoped that the discussion and proposition in this paper will contribute to the discourse on the clarification of the status of environmentally motivated unilateral trade measures in the WTO.
