AB The urban water ecosystem is the main and key factor of the urban ecosystem. By a comparative study between urban water system and human body health mechanism, the article defines Ecological Carrying Capacity on the basis of urban water health system, and then presents the quantitative model of urban water ecosystem carrying capacity (UWECC)-Pressure, based on which its calculating model is devised, including Natural Carrying Capacity (NCC) and social reviving carrying capacity. On the basis of urban water ecosystem indexes between carrying capacity and pressure, the health state of urban water ecosystem is described. Taking the city of Zhengzhou as an example, the author analyzes the comparative relationship between urban water ecosystem carrying capacity and pressure in the local areas in different periods before making a reasonable assessment on the health state of the city' s water ecosystem. It is concluded that due to increasing the investment of environment construction and protection since 1995, the health state of the city' s ecosystem has improved remarkably, the economy develops harmoniously with the urban water ecosystem.

AB Diatoms are an important part of microscopic algae that populate considerable water spaces. They reflect very well the natural qualities, geology, climate and physico-chemical conditions. Analyzing of diatoms as important indicators of water quality had also the advantage to compare the chemical parameters with the biological ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate two water ecosystems in the south part of Albania, Viroi lake and Drino river, using chemical parameters and biomonitoring based on diatoms population. Obtained results indicated that two ecosystems were in mesotrophic status according to measured average values of total phosphorus concentration in water. Also, in these two water ecosystems 78 species of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) were identified, from which 7 belong to the order Centric diatoms (Centrales), whereas the rest belongs to the order Penatte diatoms (Pennales). According to the saprobice classes, they vary from oligosaprob to beta-mesosaprob in these two investigated water ecosystems. These results showed a good relationship between water quality assessment using chemical parameters and diatoms indices. Thus, biomonitoring by using diatoms indices can be an effective and useful tool for the evaluation of the ecological status of water ecosystems.

TI INLAND WATER FISH MANAGEMENT (ifM): A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) FOR
   THE MANAGEMENT OF INLAND WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB This paper describes the development of a Decision Support System for the Management of Inland Water Ecosystems. The overall aim was to design and develop a decision support system that will assist scientists to make decisions related to the management of inland water ecosystems by providing to the users (environmental services, scientists and researchers) organised literature, descriptive and geographic information of species in inland water ecosystems. The application is an effective tool in the framework of a decision support process for the sustainable environmental management and is aiming to provide the ability to use hypothetical scenarios. The proposed DSS is named 'ifM', i.e. Inland Water Fish Management. The main advantages of the application are: its friendly graphical user interface, practical usability, extensibility and functionality without requiring special knowledge of informatics. The benefits of the application include the provision of specialised information to researchers, local authorities and stakeholders and the fact that it can be easily expanded. Finally, the achievement of this application is twofold because it promotes scientific research in the field of inland water ecosystems and it is also an excellent tool for the dissemination of environmental information and the enhancement environmental awareness.

TI Global dynamics of a nutrient-plankton system in the water ecosystem
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
AB To quantitatively study the relationship between nutritional enrichment and the oscillation of water quality, a new nutrient-plankton dynamics model is proposed in the light of a water ecosystem, such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The derived results show that the plankton-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if the concentration of the input nutrient is sufficient small. When nutrient recycling is absent, the zooplankton-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for the middle concentration of the input nutrient, whereas the coexistent equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for sufficient large concentration of the input nutrient. Furthermore, numerical simulation results confirm that the comprehensive effect of eutrophication by environmental pollution, nutrient recycling and excessive fishing intensity can induce the oscillation of water quality and the collapse of the water ecosystem.

AB Under a scenario of global climate change, the water ecosystem services of Luan River basin have attracted considerable public attention. In this paper, the term of water ecosystem services is described as Green water and blue water formed from the water cycle process to provide the conditions and utility for maintaining the structure and process of forest, grassland, wetland, lake, river ecosystem. In this study, we estimated the magnitudes and economic values of the water ecosystem services in Luan River basin. The economic value of water ecosystem services in Luan River basin was estimated to be 778.32x10(8) Yuan in 2000. The ratios of the economic values of water direct ecosystem services were 5.89%, and rest 94.11% of the all monetary value was water indirect ecosystem services. Among the water ecosystem services indicators we estimated, fruit, timber, fishery products, Fresh water supply, Hydropower and recreation were measured in the social economic system, about 59.81% of the monetary value of water ecosystem services is measured to reflect water resources ecological value.

TI Water Ecosystem Service Quality Evaluation and Value Assessment of Taihu
   Lake in China
SO WATER
AB Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Water ecosystems play an important role in the survival and development of human society. The evaluation of water ecosystem services is helpful to understand and grasp the changing rules of Taihu Lake's ecosystem services value in recent years. First, we used the Water Environment Qualities Index (WQI) to evaluate the water ecological quality of Taihu Lake; second, on the basis of the survey data from 2010 to 2018, we combined economic and ecological methods to evaluate the water ecosystem of Taihu Lake. The evaluation system includes four major service functions, 11 second-class evaluation indicators and 19 index factor. Research indicates that, (1) in the past 8 years, the WQI of Taihu Lake increased year by year and Taihu Lake changed from moderate pollution to light pollution; (2) provisioning services are the main service of Taihu Lake's water ecosystem and the order of various service values was provisioning service value > regulation service value > cultural service value > support service value, with water supply as the core function of provisioning services; and (3) the total values in 2010, 2014, and 2018 were 115.39 billion yuan, 113.31 billion yuan, and 119.96 billion yuan, respectively, showing a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. To a certain extent, the improvement in Taihu Lake's water ecological quality has led to an increase in the value of regulation services.

TI Spatial-Temporal Coupling Analysis of the Coordination between
   Urbanization and Water Ecosystem in the Yangtze River Economic Belt
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB As a primary pioneering region in China's ongoing urbanization process, the Yangtze River Economic Belt's (YREB's) urbanization process is itself continually accelerating, causing increasing pressure on the area's water ecosystem. It is necessary to examine the coordination relationship between the urbanization system and the water ecosystem in the YREB for realizing sustainable urban development. To this purpose, we use two comprehensive index systems, along with an improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. This method is used to analyze the coordination between urbanization and the water ecosystem across spatial gradients and temporal scales in the YREB, from 2008 to 2017. The factors acting as obstacles were diagnosed by utilizing the obstacle degree model. The results show that: (1) the coordination state of each region gradually improved during the 2008-2017 period. In terms of spatial distribution, the coordination state between two systems gradually increased from east to west. Moreover, the spatial differences across the 11 analyzed regions gradually narrowed with the passage of time. (2) The coordination between the two systems, from 2008 to 2017, evolved from a state of serious imbalance to a state of good coordination. The two systems passed from an initial period of imbalance or antagonism, coupled with rapid growth (2008-2011), through a period of basic coordination with steady growth (2011-2014), and finally toward a period of good coordination with slow growth (2014-2017). (3) Spatial urbanization and pressures on subsystems are the key factors acting as obstacles in the urbanization system and water ecosystem, respectively. Facing the process of rapid urbanization in China, the coupling analysis of the coordination between urbanization and the water ecosystem can help the government to formulate a reasonable new-type urban development strategy. This strategy will play an important role in China's sustainable urban development and water environmental protection. The findings of this study provide important support for urban planning in the future.

TI Spatiotemporal variability of water ecosystem services can be
   effectively quantified by a composite indicator approach
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Ecological restoration will be promoted globally as a strategic solution supporting the relevant sustainable development goals including land degradation neutrality. However, this restorative approach is facing challenges from climate change and anthropogenic land-use change. One of these acute challenges is to balance ecological restoration and water ecosystem services particularly in dryland areas that are the most vulnerable to land degradation and climate change. Therefore, it is critical to understand the spatiotemporal variability of water ecosystem services in a changing environment on a regional scale. To gain this understanding, this paper formulates a composite indicator approach by integrating gross primary productivity (GPP) and waterbodies derived from remote sensing with key soil, climate, and topographic variables. The water ecosystem service index (WESI) was quantified in 10 watersheds of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) region during 2000-2018 and found to be correlated positively with the surface runoff of these watersheds at high confidence levels. Then WESI is used in the whole CLP. The results of WESI indicate that about 90% of the CLP is low in water ecosystem services and about 45% of the CLP experienced significant increases for water ecosystem services under the impacts of large scale vegetation restoration, climate change, and land-use change. The WESI approach provides an efficient alternative to the complex modelling approaches that need much more ground based monitoring data. The WESI is useful for mapping the spatial pattern and temporal trends of regional water ecosystem services that are critical for ecological restoration and land-use planning in a changing environment.

TI Investigating the Impact of Urbanization on Water Ecosystem Services in
   the Dongjiang River Basin: A Spatial Analysis
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The expansion of urban areas has resulted in a substantial increase in demand for water ecosystem services. To address this issue, this study aims to investigate how the interaction between urbanization and water ecosystem services changed in response to different levels of urbanization in the Dongjiang River Basin from 1985 to 2020. The research examines four water ecosystem services (water yield, soil retention, and water purifications of N and P) and three types of urbanizations (population urbanization, economic urbanization, and land urbanization) to identify spatial heterogeneities among developed urban areas, developing urban areas, and rural regions, as well as their dynamic interactions. The findings indicate that water ecosystem services and urbanizations tend to be spatially polarized, with high values downstream and low values upstream. Although they have become more closely aligned, there is a local mismatch under basin-level homogeneity. Urbanization has migrated and centralized in a southward direction, while water ecosystem services have moved westward. This difference of migration results in an increasing trade-off in the west band of Dongjiang River. In particular, the developing urban area has been strengthening the function of the transition zone between the developed urban area and rural area, resulting in a dramatic decrease in synergy. The synergy of the rural area dominates the increasing synergy of the entire basin, but the developed urban area tends to lower the water ecosystem services that lag behind urbanization. The study recommends that policymakers consider different urban levels when developing urbanization plans and water resource management strategies, and implement measures to maintain the synergy in the rural area and mitigate the trade-off in the developing area.

AB At present, ecological water are mainly occupied by a rapid development of social economic and population explosion, which seriously threat the ecological security and water security in watershed and regional scale. Due to the lack of a unified standard of measuring the benefit of water resource, social economic and ecosystem, the water allocation can't take place effectively in social economic and ecosystem. The function which provided by water in terrestrial, aquatic and social economic system can be addressed through water ecosystem service, and it can guide the water allocation in water resource management. Throughout the researches of water ecosystem service, a clear identification of the connection of water ecosystem service function has not been established, and eco-economic approach can't meet the practical requirement of water allocation. Thus, it is necessary to carry out the research on water ecosystem service assessment based on eco-hydrological process. This paper proposes a connection, establishes a hierarchical feature and an indicator system of water ecosystem service function based on 'nature-artificiality' dual water cycle theory and eco-hydrological process in the beginning. In approach, this paper establishes an integrated assessment approach through prototype observation technology, numerical simulation, physical simulation and modern geographic information technology. The core content is to couple an eco-hydrological model, which involves the key processes of distributed hydrological model (WEP), ecological model (CLM-DGVM), in terms of eco-hydrological process. By making use of prototype observation technology, numerical simulation, modern geographic information technology and statistics approach, this paper systematically evaluates the eco-hydrological process and evolution of Luanhe River Basin in terms of precipitation, ET, runoff, groundwater, the scale, form and distribution of ecosystem. According to the results of eco-hydrological process, this paper assesses the direct and derived service function. The result indicates that the general service function of 2010 has minor increase than 2007, however the general function of two years are in common level; Compare with different region, the upstream, middle stream and downstream indicates "worse", "common" and "good" level respectively. The first three derived functions are leisure, offer products and industrial water use.

TI Improving water ecosystem sustainability of urban water system by
   management strategies optimization
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Water management strategies play an important role in water shortage alleviation. This study evaluates the cost and water ecosystem benefit of 14 water management strategies in Beijing in the future scenarios for 2020 and 2035. In addition, optimal implements of abatement strategies are obtained within the context of legislated targets, with the consideration of interaction among strategies. The result shows that Beijing can meet its commitments for total water use and pollution control by the water management strategies implementation in both 2020 and 2035. For 14 water management strategies analyzed in this study, 5 options with negative abatement cost value achieve 12.2-24.1% of the total water ecosystem benefit in 2020 and 2035. Wastewater reclamation is the most efficient strategy in water ecosystem impact (WEI) reduction, which contributes 38.4% of the total WEI reduction with an abatement cost of 1.6 Yuan/m(3) H2O -eq. However, the sequence of optimal strategy implementation rate is not in accordance with the abatement cost of the strategies. The most cost-effective option is the water-efficient shower head, while the highest implementation rate is found for promotion of production technologies. A comparison between water management optimization with and without the consideration of interactions among strategies shows that taking the interaction among strategies into account imposes almost no influence on the total WEI reduction. But it has impacts on optimal implementation rate of each water management option and the cost estimation (+10.8%) of water management implementation. Such a systematic analysis of water management strategies provides general recommendations on sustainable water resource management in water scarce regions.

TI Review of River Basin Water Resource Management in China
SO WATER
AB Water resources are the basis for supporting the entire life system of the Earth. However, with the frequent global water crises-especially in the river basins of China-the issue of water resources has become a bottleneck that limits its development. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out relevant research. In this paper, we systematically analyzed different classification methods of the service functions of water ecosystems as well as factors that affect it. Results showed that climate, land cover, human activities, and their own endowment conditions were the main factors affecting the service functions of water ecosystems. Based on these, water resource management in China river basins was expounded from three aspects: water resources protection, allocation, and utilization. At the same time, the impacts of water resource management on land use in China were also summarized. Finally, the key trends of the next study were summarized as follows: improvement of the classification system of basin water ecosystem service functions, improvement of the mechanism of the basin water market; comprehensive tradeoff of water resource exploitation and protection in basins; and basin water resource management from the perspective of multidisciplinary crossing.

TI Synthetic Dyes: A Threat to the Environment and Water Ecosystem
SO TEXTILES AND CLOTHING: ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND SOLUTIONS
AB The textile industry is among the most complex and oldest industries. Dyeing is the process in textiles that highly influences the choice of people for their clothing. Synthetic dyes are highly used for textile coloration since these are expected to have a wide range of colors with high substantivity to textiles. Along with these beneficial characteristics, dyes are associated with environmental hazards, particularly that concerning the water ecosystem. Effluents generated during the synthesis of dyes and application on textiles cause adverse effects on biological life in water bodies. This chapter aims to summarize the relationship between synthetic dyes and the environment or the water ecosystem, the impact on biological life in water, and advanced approaches to deal with these associated hazards.

TI Integrating Ecosystem Services Into Water Resource Management: An
   Indicator-Based Approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Natural ecosystems are fundamental to local water cycles and the water ecosystem services that humans enjoy, such as water provision, outdoor recreation, and flood protection. However, integrating ecosystem services into water resources management requires that they be acknowledged, quantified, and communicated to decision-makers. We present an indicator framework that incorporates the supply of, and demand for, water ecosystem services. This provides an initial diagnostic for water resource managers and a mechanism for evaluating tradeoffs through future scenarios. Building on a risk assessment framework, we present a three-tiered indicator for measuring where demand exceeds the supply of services, addressing the scope (spatial extent), frequency, and amplitude for which objectives (service delivery) are not met. The Ecosystem Service Indicator is measured on a 0-100 scale, which encompasses none to total service delivery. We demonstrate the framework and its applicability to a variety of services and data sources (e.g., monitoring stations, statistical yearbooks, modeled datasets) from case studies in China and Southeast Asia. We evaluate the sensitivity of the indicator scores to varying levels data and three methods of calculation using a simulated test dataset. Our indicator framework is conceptually simple, robust, and flexible enough to offer a starting point for decision-makers and to accommodate the evolution and expansion of tools, models and data sources used to measure and evaluate the value of water ecosystem services.

TI Understanding the economic value of water ecosystem services from
   tropical forests: A systematic review for South and Central America
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
AB There is a well-established body of literature on monetary valuation of water ecosystem services to support the case for sustaining tropical forests. However, this literature is heterogeneous in its purposes and approaches and has not been carefully compared, providing a fragmented view of the values of forest water services. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through an orderly review and a regression meta-analysis of existing valuation studies at the regional level in South and Central America. This analysis allows identifying some factors that systematically influence forest values. However, it also reveals a lack of a systematized approach to valuation and a lack of sufficiently coherent evidence. This represents a barrier for the incorporation of the values of water ecosystem services into decision-making.

TI Marine Litter in Transitional Water Ecosystems: State of The Art Review
   Based on a Bibliometric Analysis
SO WATER
AB Transitional water ecosystems (TWEs), despite their ecological and economic importance, are largely affected by human pressures that could be responsible for significant inputs of litter in the marine environment. Plastic input in coastal ponds, lagoons, river deltas and estuaries, could be driven by a wide range of human activities such as agriculture, waste disposal, municipal and industrial wastewater effluents, aquaculture, fishing and touristic activities and urban impacts. However, it remains unknown what the impact of plastic input in these TWEs could have on natural capital and, therefore, the ability for an ecosystem to provide goods and services to human beings. Given the large interest with regards to the conservation of transitional water ecosystems and the clear exposure risk to plastic and microplastic pollution, this study aims to perform: (i) a bibliometric analyses on existing literature regarding the levels of marine litter in such environments; (ii) a selection among the available literature of homogeneous data; and (iii) statistical analyses to explore data variability. Results suggest that: (i) research on microplastics in these ecosystems did not begin to be published until 2013 for lagoons, 2014 for river mouths and 2019 for coastal ponds. The majority of articles published on studies of microplastics in lagoons did not occur until 2019; (ii) sediments represent the matrix on which sampling and extraction variability allow the statistical analyses on data reported by the literature; (iii) the Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) test two-way evidenced that the level of protection of marine and terrestrial areas produced similar values while the habitat type showed low significance in terms of its effect on microplastic levels, shape and size in sediments.

TI Biological consequences of environmental pollution in running water
   ecosystems: A case study in zooplankton
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Biodiversity in running water ecosystems such as streams and rivers is threatened by chemical pollution derived from anthropogenic activities. Zooplankton are ecologically indicative in aquatic ecosystems, owing to their position of linking the top-down and bottom-up regulators in aquatic food webs, and thus of great potential to assess ecological effects of human-induced pollution. Here we investigated the influence of water pollution on zooplankton communities characterized by metabarcoding in Songhua River Basin in northeast China. Our results clearly showed that varied levels of anthropogenic disturbance significantly influenced water quality, leading to distinct environmental pollution gradients (p < 0.001), particularly derived from total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and pH. Redundancy analysis showed that such environmental gradients significantly influenced the geographical distribution of zooplankton biodiversity (R = 0.283, p = 0.001). In addition, along with the trend of increasing environmental pollution, habitat-related indicator taxa were shifted in constituents, altering from large-sized species (e.g. arthropods) in lightly disturbed areas to small-sized organisms (e.g. rotifers and ciliates) in highly disturbed areas. All these findings clearly showed that anthropogenic activity-derived water pollution significantly influenced biological communities. Thus, biotic consequences of human-induced environmental pollution in running water ecosystems should be deeply investigated. More importantly, the findings of biotic consequences should be well integrated into existing monitoring programs to further assess impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, as well as to advance the management of running water ecosystems for conservation and ecological restoration.

TI Nutritional support of inland aquatic food webs by aged carbon and
   organic matter
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS
AB Aged (typically tens to thousands of years old) forms of non-living carbon (C) and organic matter (OM) predominate in many inland water ecosystems. Advances in the methodologies used to measure natural abundance radiocarbon (C-14) have led to increased use of natural C-14 as both a source and age tracer in aquatic ecosystem and food web studies. Here, we review (1) Delta C-14 values and ages of C and OM typically found in different inland water systems, (2) the mechanisms through which these materials enter inland water ecosystems, and (3) all available C-14 data on aquatic consumers across a range of inland water ecosystem types. Using Delta C-14 values of aquatic consumers and their potential nutritional resources, we estimate contributions of aged C and OM to aquatic consumer biomass. We conclude that in nearly every case, one or more forms of aged C and/or OM contribute to aquatic consumer nutrition in inland water ecosystems.

TI Forests and water in South America
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB South America is experiencing rapid change in forest cover, of both native and planted forest. Forest cover loss is primarily attributable to fire, logging, and conversion of native forest to agriculture, pasture, and forest plantations, and types of change vary within and among the many diverse types of forests in South America. Major changes in forest cover and growing policy concerns underscore an urgent need for research on sustainable forest management and water ecosystem services in South America. Differences in land ownership and management objectives create trade-offs between wood production and water ecosystem services from forests. Work is needed to quantify how forest change and management affect ecosystem services, such as wood production versus water provision. Current scientific understanding of forest management effects on water ecosystem services in South America has important limitations, including a scarcity of long-term records and few long-term integrated watershed studies. Industry, government, universities, and local communities should collaborate on integrated applied studies of forests and water. Data archiving and publically available data are required. The creation of national networks and a multi-country South America network to identify and implement common water research protocols, share results, and explore their implications would promote common and well-supported policies. Hydrologists working in South America are well placed to tackle the challenges and opportunities for collaborative research that will maintain the intrinsic values and water ecosystem services provided by South America's forests.

TI Evaluation and evolution analysis of water ecosystem service value in
   the yangtze river delta region based on meta-analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization lead to environmental pollution and damage the stability of regional ecosystems. The Yangtze River Delta region is an economically developed region in China, faces the problems of water environment pollution and water ecosystem service degradation. Reasonable assessment of water ecosystem service value (ESV) is of great significance for grasping the status of regional water ecosystem services, improving water ecological environment, and realizing regional sustainable development. This study collects 119 research literature about China, including 156 observations to establish a value transfer database; specially builds a Meta-analysis model including the variables of climate conditions, environmental pollution and environmental protection, then assesses the waters ESV in the Yangtze River Delta using the model and analyzes the changes from 2009 to 2018. The study finds that the location, population density, the area of the site, average annual precipitation, literature characteristics, landscape characteristics, wastewater discharge, environmental protection expenditure, and wastewater treatment costs can affect the water ESV significantly. Based on the meta-analysis benefit transfer model to evaluate the water ESV in Yangtze River Delta region is RMB 177,126 yuan/ h h a / year and the growth rate is 27.18%. The place with the highest value per unit area is Shanghai, and the total value in Jiangsu Province is the highest. Economic development, waste water discharge and wastewater treatment costs are the main reasons for the changes and differences in the value of water ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Delta region. The contribution of this study to the field of water ESV assessment is that the meta-analysis model includes a broader set of influencing variables, including landscape, population density, climate change and environmental protection. It provides a practical reference for water ESV assessment on the local scale and a scientific basis for water area management related to the development of water area and ecological compensation, as well as promote the sustainable development of water ecosystems.

TI Internal nitrogen and phosphorus loading in a seasonally stratified
   reservoir: Implications for eutrophication management of deep-water
   ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Water eutrophication is a serious global issue because of excess external and internal nutrient inputs. Understanding the intensity and contribution of internal nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading in deep-water ecosystems is of great significance for water body eutrophication management. In this study, we combined intact sediment core incubation, high-resolution peeper (HR-Peeper) sampling, and analysis of N and P forms and other environmental factors in the water column and sediments to evaluate the contributions of internal N and P loading to water eutrophication by N and P fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) of the Panjiakou Reservoir (PJKR), a deep-water ecosystem where eutrophication threatens the security of the local drinking water supply in North China. The results indicated that the PJKR showed obvious thermal and dissolved oxygen (DO) stratification in the warm seasons and full mixing in the cold seasons. The mean DO concentration was 9.9 and 3.55 mg/L in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, respectively, in warm seasons and 10.7 mg/L in cold seasons. The sediment acted as a source of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), NH4+-N, and NO2--N and a sink of NO3--N. The SRP fluxes were 5.28 +/- 4.34 and 2.30 +/- 1.93 mg m(-)(2).d(-1) in warm and cold seasons, respectively, and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) fluxes were -0.66 +/- 47.84 and 44.04 +/- 84.05 mg m(-2).d(-1). Seasonal hypoxia accelerated the release of P rather than N from the sediments in warm seasons, which came mainly from Fe-P and Org-P under anoxic conditions. The strong negative NO3--N flux (diffusion from the water column to the sediment) implied an intensive denitrification process at the SWI, which can counteract the release flux of NH4+-N and NO2--N, resulting in the sediment acting as a weak dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source for the overlying water. We also found that internal N loading accounted for only similar to 9% of the total N loading, while internal P loading accounted for 43% of the total P loading of the reservoir. Our results highlight that efforts to manage the internal loading of deep-water ecosystems should focus on P and seasonal hypoxia.

TI Ecological problems concerning the distribution of the vulnerable fish
   fauna in running water ecosystems of East Macedonia and Thrace region
   (Greece)
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB Running water ecosystems such as rivers and torrents represent sensitive systems with very important value for the environmental stability, as their protection and conservation is important for local and regional development. The running water ecosystems of East Macedonia and Thrace region in Northern Greece, during the last decades, present an important environmental degradation, mostly due to the extreme use of their natural resources, the pollution they accept and the inappropriate imposed environmental management. Therefore, their vulnerable fish fauna is disturbed and in some cases exhausted, with a negative impact in the total ecosystem and its ecological structure. This paper aims to observe the major environmental problems of the main running water ecosystems concerning important risks for the fish fauna and the fish populations in East Macedonia's and Thrace region as the rivers Strymon, Aggitis, Nestos, Evros and Ardas and the torrents, Marmaras, Komsatos, Kosinthos, Filiouris, Bosbos and Erythropotamos. Data about the fish fauna and the ecological state of the above running water ecosystems were collected from scientific references, research projects and from reports of the relative 'Fisheries Public Authorities' of each ecosystem. The fish populations from a significant number of species that leave in the above ecosystems face a lot of problems in comparison to past, even if nowadays the majority of them is protected from specific national and international laws and conventions. The findings of the study can support the planning of a sustainable and rational environmental friendly management from the local authorities, and enhances the relations between the living resources, as the vulnerable fish species, and their habitats in running water systems.

TI Effects of the Grain for Green Program on the water ecosystem services
   in an arid area of China-Using the Shiyang River Basin as an example
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB The Grain for Green Program (GFGP) is one of the largest land restoration/afforestation and one of the most ambitious ecosystem conservation programmes in the world; the programme has altered the land-use pattern and exerted a significant influence on the ecosystem services. Water ecosystem services are important for arid and semiarid China, however, few of the researchers tried to quantify the effect of GFGP on water ecosystem services. The Shiyang River Basin is one of the key areas of GFGP implementation in the arid region of northwest China. We used the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model to quantitatively evaluate the changes in water yield and water conservation of water ecosystem services during the implementation of the GFGP from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate the following: 1) Land use/cover patterns in Shiyang River Basin have changed dramatically after the implementation of GFGP. Forest and grassland has increased significantly. 2) The average water yield depth and the total water yield decreased from 56.4 mm/year to 55.89 mm/year and 22.88 x 10(8) m(3)/year to 22.68 x 10(8) m(3)/year, respectively, and the average water conservation capacity and total water conservation increased from 16.90 mm/year to 17.99 mm/year and 6.86 x 10(8) m(3)/year to 7.30 x 10(8) m(3)/year, respectively. 3) The total water yield and total water conservation of forest and grassland increased, due to the increasing area of forest and grassland. 4) Thanks to the adoption of relatively rational land-use conversion patterns, at regional scale, the implementation of GFGP improved water conservation and did not result in a significant reduction of water yield in Shiyang River Basin. Results underline the importance of selecting appropriate land-use conversion types in order to achieve sustainable provision of ecosystem services at the regional scale.

TI Existent nature reserves not optimal for water service provision and
   conservation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB Water ecosystem services dynamically connect human society and the biosphere across spatiotemporal scales to finally support socioeconomic development and human well-being. Water ecosystem services are usually abundant in the so-called water tower regions which comprise mainly the mountains and plateaus where many big rivers originate. However, these water tower regions are also ecologically vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Furthermore, the effectiveness of conservation management on water ecosystem services in these regions is still not so clear. We developed a biophysical-based composite water ecosystem service index (ESw) for quantifying and mapping the spatial patterns and temporal changes of water ecosystem services on a large regional scale. We apply this approach to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in southwestern China, the world's largest and most highly protected water tower region. The results show that the areas with a high level of ESw as the priority areas for conservation account for 39.88% of the QTP with a spatially heterogeneous distribution among river basins and nature reserves. But these nature reserves accommodate only 22.52% of the priority areas with large conservation gaps in the river basins and at local scales. The nature reserves are effective in mitigating water ecosystem services degradation and facilitating their restoration. Therefore, the spatial optimization of nature conservation can be addressed for the sustainable management of the ecosystems and their water ecosystem services to support well-being of local and downstream societies. The assessment method formulated in this research is adaptable to other similar water tower regions.

TI Cyanobacteria research methods in water ecosystems
SO HRVATSKE VODE
AB Cyanobacteria are the oldest photosynthetic organisms on earth. They are exceptionally interesting due to their structure and their role in the evolutionary processes of eukaryotic cell creation. They are present in a number of habitats that are frequently characterized by extreme living conditions. They fill numerous ecological niches and significantly contribute to the circulation of elements in nature. Cyanobacteria are called the "pioneers" because they are the first to settle in inhospitable environments. Cyanobacteria research in water ecosystems frequently poses a challenge to different scientific areas. Numerous methods are implemented, from chemical, biological or ecological methods to the most advanced molecular methods and optical monitoring via satellites. The paper presents two examples of cyanobacteria research - in a microbial mat, where they occur as an important photoautotrophic component, and in aquaculture, where their blooms and toxins may cause adverse consequences to human and ecosystem health and material damage as well.

TI Dissolved Nitrous Oxide in Shallow-Water Ecosystems under Saline-Alkali
   Environment
SO WATER
AB The problem of global warming is becoming more and more serious. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas. Most current studies on dissolved N2O concentration have focused on inland freshwater and seawater while paying less attention to coastal agricultural catchment areas. The coastal agricultural catchment area is the link between the farmland ecosystem and the aquatic ecosystem, which is shallow in water depth. Moreover, due to the high salt content and obvious periodic change, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and human activities and has strong potential for N2O emission. Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the characteristics of the changes in the dissolved N2O concentration in the shallow-water ecosystem under the saline-alkali environment of the coastal reclamation area and to identify the main controlling factors. The soil of Yudong reclamation area in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province was collected to carry out the submerged cultivation experiment. In order to simulate the saline-alkali situation of the coastal reclamation area, four salt gradients (S1-S4), four alkali gradients (A1-A4), and three levels of exogenous nitrogen concentration (N1-N3). In addition, the experiment set a control treatment (CK) without salt and alkali addition. After 2 weeks of cultivation in a shallow water layer of about 5 cm, the dissolved N2O concentration and its influencing factors were measured and analyzed by collecting the overlying water sample and sediment after 24 h of fertilization. The results showed that changes in the saline-alkali environment in shallow-water ecosystems significantly affected the changes in dissolved N2O concentration. The saline-alkali indicators (EC and pH of the overlying water and sediment), DO of the overlying water, and the microbial genes nirS, nirK, and nosZ were the key influencing factors of N2O production in shallow-water systems. The correlation between nirS gene abundance and the dissolved N2O concentration was the highest. The BP neural network model can be used to simulate and predict the dissolved N2O concentration in overlying water under saline-alkali environment. Based on the experimental results, this study can provide a scientific basis for understanding the nitrogen cycling process in shallow-water ecosystems in the coastal reclamation area, improving the absorption of non-point-source nitrogen and reducing N2O emissions in shallow-water wetlands.

TI Theory and practice of water ecosystem services valuation: Where are we
   going?
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Water resources have been widely cited as a prime example of ecosystem services (ES), especially when the issue is valuation. Because of the importance of water ecosystem services (ESw), they are being effectively evaluated in at least three aspects: clarity about the type of valuation employed; adoption of a strong theoretical basis guided by ecological knowledge; and the inclusion of analytical elements that ensure social control and direction in decision making. Our study sought to determine whether these prerogatives are actually relevant, by assessing the emphasis in the valuation of ESw among ES publications. From the literature, we define five types of valuation and five major theoretical principles that can be broken down into 14 indicators that we used in our analysis of ESw studies. Our results indicated that the current knowledge about ESw carry the false impression that the ecosystem services valuation is sufficiently consolidated to support decisions about payments for ESw.

TI Multi-dimensional Perspectives and Differentiated Strategies of
   Basin-Scale Water Ecological Conservation and Restoration
SO LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS
AB The status of water ecological environment matters to the well-being of all people. A water ecological management system for high-quality development is required to meet people's ever-growing expectations for a better life. This relies on a comprehensive understanding of water ecosystems from multi-dimensional perspectives-processes of ecosystem services, history, culture, and art-at the basin scale. Moreover, differentiated strategies should be proposed to adjust to varied natural resource endowment, and socio-economic and cultural heritage in different regions. Only by centering on both ecology and culture through multiple processes (e.g., evolution of regional river basin ecosystem, water cultures, and landscape patterns) dynamically under proper scales (basin, region, river corridor, or river reach), can the water ecosystem function more effectively. In this issue, LA Frontiers hopes to propel interaction between multiple disciplines and industries among spatial planning, hydraulic engineering, and landscape design with research and practice, so as to ensure a safe, clean, healthy, and picturesque river-lake system for people's well-being.

TI Estimating the Impact of Ecological Migrants on the South-to-North Water
   Diversion in China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) provides significant benefits in facilitating water security and improving ecology in northern China. However, few studies have estimated the water value of the SNWD and the corresponding subsequent subsidies of the ecological migrants in Xichuan County displaced by the project. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study analyzed the water ecosystem changes in Xichuan County in 2000-2020 and valued the water transfer of the SNWD. We calculated the water cost, the water value of the trunk line project, and the four provinces (Hebei, Henan, Beijing, and Tianjin) of CNY 4.04, 39.64, and 120.93 billion, respectively, and the proportion of the three was 1:10:30 during 2014-2020. The water ecosystem area showed a rapid increase when the SNWD became operational since the end of 2014. The subsequent annual subsidy gap of ecological migrants was CNY 0.84 billion, which only accounted for 4.31% of the gross profit of SNWD. Our results imply that relevant water sectors have sufficient profits to support corresponding subsequent subsidies for ecological migrants. Ecological migrants are a major challenge for water transfer projects. Overall, this study fills a gap of interactions between subsequent policies and ecological migrants and provides a typical case for managing the migration problem caused by sustainable water management worldwide.

TI Unravelling Stakeholder Perceptions to Enable Adaptive Water Governance
   in Dryland Systems
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Adaptive water governance seeks to increase a social-ecological system's adaptive capacity in the face of uncertainty and change. This is especially important in non-linear dryland systems that are already exposed to water scarcity and increasing degradation. Conservation of water ecosystem services is key for increasing adaptive capacity in drylands, however, how stakeholders perceive water ecosystem services greatly affects how they are managed, as well as the potential for adaptive water governance. This paper focuses on identifying the system's potential for enabling adaptive water governance by analysing different stakeholder perceptions on water ecosystem services. It takes the Rio del Carmen watershed as a case study, offering important insights for an increasing number of water-scarce regions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the watershed in order to unravel their perceptions and understand the governance context. We found disparities in how stakeholders perceive water ecosystem services have led to water overexploitation and several conflicts over water access. Our results indicate that stakeholder perceptions have a major influence on the system's adaptability, as they shape the acquisition of water ecosystem services. Divergent stakeholder perceptions act as an important barrier to collaboration. Generating and sharing knowledge could facilitate the development of a common vision, allowing all actors to co-create information about water ecosystem services and the system state, engaging them in a participatory process, suitable for their context, and that will better support adaptive water governance.

TI Differences of the microbial community structures and predicted
   metabolic potentials in the lake, river, and wetland sediments in
   Dongping Lake Basin
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In freshwater ecosystems, wetlands are generally distinguished from deep-water ecosystems by 2-m water level as boundary. However, the difference of sediment microbial communities between wetlands and deep-water ecosystems is still unclear. We combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing and community metabolic prediction to compare sediment microbial communities and predicted metabolic genes of wetlands (natural and constructed wetlands) and deep-water ecosystems (river and lake) along with environmental factors in summer and autumn in Dongping Lake Basin. Results showed that the deep-water ecosystems had significantly higher community richness than the wetlands in autumn in the freshwater basin, which was mostly related to the pH of sediments. However, no significant difference in community richness was found in summer. Besides, the composition of both predicted metabolic genes and microbial communities was significantly affected by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The wetlands exhibited high predicted gene abundances related to xenobiotic biodegradation possibly due to the high DOC or DO level. Compared with the wetlands, most of the deep-water ecosystems exhibited high predicted gene abundances related to element (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) metabolism possibly due to the low DOC and DO levels in the freshwater basin. This study can expand the knowledge of ecological function distribution and detoxification mechanism of microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems.

A practically total identity of the characteristics is shown. A conditions of applications of the regression model well-known in oceanology and limnology are defined. Concentrations of the individual optically active components (OAC) can be determined with the adequate accuracy in particular cases only. A comparative analysis of two representations of data obtained under the remote sensing of water objects was carried out: the OAC and the optical state of water ecosystem (OSWE) representations. The behaviour of model spectra in the space of optical states (SOS) is analyzed. The layout geometry of SOS was studied and the interpretation of some region of the space in the frame of the conventional hydrochemical and hydrobiological terms was performed. It was shown that the information content of the brightness coefficients for water objects is determined by integral status of ecosystem.

SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Understanding the changes and drivers of water ecosystem services (WESs) can provide guidance for the management of ecological restoration programs (ERPs). This study analyzed the changes in WESs (water yield and water purification) and landscape patterns in the Jianghuai Ecological Economic Zone (JHEEZ) from 2000 to 2020 and revealed the effect of landscape patterns on WESs in different periods (development priority and ecological priority) through a geographic detector (GD) and geographic weighted regression (GWR). During the development priority period, there was an increase in landscape diversity and aggregation, as well as a decrease in landscape fragmentation and complexity. Additionally, the area of water bodies landscape decreased while the aggregation of cropland and built-up land increased. In contrast, during the ecological priority period, landscape diversity, fragmentation, and complexity increased, while landscape aggregation decreased. The water body area also increased, and cropland fragmentation increased. Water yield experienced an initial decrease and subsequent increase, while water purification continued to improve. Patch density and the contagion index are the main factors affecting WESs, and the improvement of water connectivity and the reduction of fragmented Landscape are of great significance to WESs. This study analyzed the impact of landscape pattern changes on WESs from a geospatial perspective and provided a reference for the sustainable development of ERPs in the JHEEZ.

AB Amazonas is the department with the largest number of Private Conservation Areas in the country. It also has several natural conservation areas managed by the State with a recognized biodiversity richness at national and global levels. These achievements are the result of major environmental management efforts based on governance guidelines within the framework of various processes such as Ecological and Economic Zoning (EEZ), Regional Biodiversity Strategy (ERDB), Regional Conservation Areas System (SICRE), among others. The indicated, has been in accordance with the recognized tourist, archaeological and architectural potential presented by the department. These actions have been consistent with the characteristic rural landscape and a vision of conservation and care of the environment. Contrary to these processes, and especially in the Andean zone where water sources of important watersheds such as those of the Utcubamba River, Imaza, among others, changes in land use would be following a contrary course by threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services Mainly associated with paramo or pajonal ecosystems. Is it possible to identify and validate the above? What evidences exist and show that the rural landscape and to preserve in Amazonas would be threatened by endogenous processes? If so: What does it merit to achieve in particular the conservation of water ecosystem services as a fundamental element in the rural landscape? The study uses primary and secondary information related to changes in land use, area of agricultural activities, quantity of chemical inputs to improve water quality in relevant watershed sites with and without conservation areas. Using techniques of Geographic Information Systems and through inter-temporal analysis are the forces related to threats in water sources and propose solutions according to context.

TI Integrated study of the water-ecosystem-economy in the Heihe River Basin
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The ecological water diversion project in the Heihe River Basin is the first successful case in China in which the ecological systems in a river basin have been rescued. This project serves as a valuable example for the management of ecosystems in other inland river basins. This paper reviews the integrated studies of the water-ecosystem-economy relationship in the Heihe River Basin and concludes that sustainable development in inland river basins requires the basin to be considered as a whole, with the relationships between the upstream, midstream and downstream areas of the basin coordinated appropriately. Successful development in these basins will be reflected in an improved output per cubic meter of water and the implementation of integrated river basin management practices.

TI Blue water scarcity in the Black Sea catchment: Identifying key actors
   in the water-ecosystem-energy-food nexus
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Large-scale water scarcity indicators have been widely used to map and inform decision makers and the public about the use of river flows, a vital and limited renewable resource. However, spatiotemporal interrelations among users and administrative entities are still lacking in most large-scale studies. Water scarcity and interrelations are at the core of the water-ecosystem-energy-food nexus. In this paper, we balance water availability in the Black Sea catchment with requirements and consumptive use of key water users, i.e., municipalities, power plants, manufacturing, irrigation and livestock breeding, accounting for evaporation from major reservoirs as well as environmental flow requirements. We use graph theory to highlight interrelations between users and countries along the hydrological network. The results show that water scarcity occurs mainly in the summer due to higher demand for irrigation and reservoir evaporation in conjunction with relatively lower water resources, and in the fall-winter period due to lower water resources and the relatively high demand for preserving ecosystems and from sectors other than irrigation. Cooling power plants and the demands of urban areas cause scarcity in many isolated locations in the winter and, to a far greater spatial extent, in the summer with the demands for irrigation. Interrelations in water scarcity-prone areas are mainly between relatively small, intra-national rivers, for which the underlying national and regional governments act as key players in mitigating water scarcity within the catchment. However, many interrelations exist for larger rivers, highlighting the need for international cooperation that could be achieved through a water-ecosystem-energy-food nexus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Assessment of water ecological carrying capacity using an
   indicator-based method applied to Tieling City, China
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB Water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) refers to the ability of a water ecosystem to support and withstand economic and social development. WECC assessments can provide helpful information for resolving water issues. Since WECC involves a wide range of influence factors, indicator-based methods are useful tools for this type of evaluation. However, there are still some imperfections in the existing indicator-based methods for WECC evaluation, primarily in the aspects of index frameworks, indicator selection and evaluation criteria. Based on the pressure-support force-state index framework, this paper presents an indicator-based WECC evaluation method (PSSM). Using PSSM, overall WECC evaluation can be obtained by assessing the pressure of socio-economic development on the water ecosystem, the support from the water ecosystem for human development, and the health status of the water ecosystem. PSSM is directly focused on the pressure-support effect, and fully considers the determinant influence on WECC of the health status of the water ecosystem. The application of PSSM in Tieling City shows that further reduction in the pressure that comes from socio-economic development is still required, and the health status of the water ecosystem should be further improved.

TI WASTEWATER-CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER AS A SOURCE OF ENDOGENOUS HORMONES
   AND PHARMACEUTICALS TO SURFACE WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Increasing residential development in watershed recharge areas increases the likelihood of groundwater and surface water contamination by wastewater effluent, particularly where on-site sewage treatment is employed. This effluent contains a range of compounds including those that have been demonstrated to mimic or interfere with the function of natural hormones in aquatic organisms and humans. To explore whether groundwater contaminated by discharge from on-site septic systems affects water quality in surface water ecosystems, we measured steroidal hormones, pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) in water collected from six aquifer-fed ponds in areas of higher and lower residential density on Cape Cod ( Massachusetts, USA). We detected both a greater number and higher concentrations of OWCs in samples collected from ponds located in higher residential density areas. Most often detected were the steroidal hormones androstenedione, estrone, and progesterone and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, pentoxifylline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Of particular concern, estrogenic hormones were present at concentrations approaching those that induce physiological responses in fish. While a number of papers have reported on surface water contamination by OWCs from wastewater treatment plants, our results show that surface water ecosystems in unconfined aquifer settings are susceptible to contamination by estrogenic and other biologically active OWCs through recharge from aquifers contaminated by residential septic systems.

TI Assessment for the Possibility of Water-ecosystem Restoration Applying
   LID Techniques in the Deokjin Park Area, Jeonju City
SO ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB In this study, we investigated the restoration possibility of the old streams by enhancing the rainwater infiltration in the watershed of Deokjin Park, Jeonju City. This study was performed by modeling groundwater discharge to the streams under various conditions. We assessed the amount and location of groundwater recharge enhancement to restore the streams and evaluated whether the baseflows of the restored streams are sufficient to keep the water ecosystem of the Deokjin Pond. The results show that the baseflow of the streams can persist for a longer time even during the dry season when the rainwater drainage system is recovered similarly to the those before development using low impact development (LID) techniques. The enhancements of recharge in the headwater area, which is the area around the zoo and Daeji Village in the Deokjin Park watershed, is useful to increase the baseflows of the downstream reaches. Furthermore, spreaded recharge over a widespread area is better to prevent the streams from drying than the intensive recharge at a few sites.

TI Linking chemical and physical parameters of a coastal water ecosystem
   with macrobenthic assemblages to assess environmental disturbance
SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Environmental disturbance, whether natural or anthropogenic, may change the structure of macrobenthic assemblages (across various spatial and temporal scales) in terms of taxa richness, animal abundance, and animal biomass. Such changes may be used as an indicator and can provide a quantitative basis when assessing the levels of disturbance. This study is aimed to assess environmental disturbance caused by fish farming by linking chemical and physical parameters to differences in the structure of macrobenthic communities. The study sites comprised coastal water ecosystems in the Awerange Gulf, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The study compared macrobenthic communities associated with polyculture and monoculture farming against reference sites. The tendency of reduction in their abundance occurred at polyculture and monoculture sites, compared to the reference site, i.e. 5882 ind. m(-2), 3531 ind. m(-2), 2112.5 ind. m(-2), respectively. The results from multivariate and graphical methods using NMDS plots, k-dominance curve, and ABC curves, tend to be in accordance with the results from index values, thus both methods may be used as a apart of rapid assessment of level of environmental disturbance in coastal water ecosystem. Carbon and nitrogen contents in sediment and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the most chemical and physical parameters influencing structure of macrobenthos (r=0.457; BIO-ENV).

AB Earth, the ecosphere, is a unified functional ecosystem. Ecological land classification (ELC) and regionalization divides and categorizes this unity into similar and dissimilar pieces - sectoral ecosystems - at various scales, in the interests of admiration and understanding. The recognition of land/water ecosystems in a hierarchy of sizes provides a rational base for the many-scaled problems of protection and careful exploitation in the fields of agriculture, forestry, wildlife and recreation. In forested terrain the protection of biodiversity, old growth forests, watersheds and wildlife habitat depends on spatial-temporal planning of forestry operations to maintain a preferred mosaic structure of local ecosystems within each ecological region. Without ecological understanding and a good ELC, this is impossible. Conceiving the world as comprising nested land/water ecosystems that are the source of life, elevates the role of Earth-as-context, an antidote to destructive anthropocentrism.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Using the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique and microelectrode technique, hypoxia and its effects on the release of phosphorus (P) from sediments were carefully investigated in Hongfeng Reservoir, a typical deep-water ecosystem where eutrophication and hypoxia is still an environmental challenge in Southwest China. The results suggested that hypoxia significantly promotes the release of P from sediments and the release of P under hypoxic condition mostly comes from the release of BD P. Together with the in-situ and high resolution evidences from DGT and microelectrode, the release of P from sediments under hypoxic condition was assumed to be coupled processes which are associated with the combined cycles of "P-Fe-S". Evidences from the present work implied that the internal P loadings induced by hypoxia, especially after a reduction of external P-loading, should be paid more attention in eutrophic deep-water reservoirs, Southwest China.

TI An Integrated Toolbox for the Engagement of Citizens in the Monitoring
   of Water Ecosystems
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The monitoring of water ecosystems requires consistent and accurate sensor measurements, usually provided from traditional in-situ environmental monitoring systems. Such infrastructure, however, is expensive, hard to maintain and available only in limited areas that had been affected by extreme phenomena and require continuous monitoring. Due to climate change, the monitoring of larger areas and extended water ecosystems is imperative, raising the question of whether this monitoring can be disengaged from the in-situ monitoring systems. Due to climate change and extreme weather phenomena, more citizens are affected by environmental issues and become aware of the need to contribute to their monitoring. As a result, they are willing to offer their time to support the collection of scientific data. Collecting such data from volunteers, with no technical knowledge and while using low-cost equipment such as smart phones and portable sensors, raises the question of data quality and consistency. We present here a novel integrated toolbox that can support the organization of crowd-sourcing activities, ensure the engagement of the participants, the data collection in a consistent way, enforce extensive data quality controls and provide to local authorities and scientists access to the collected information in a uniform way, through widely accepted standards.

TI A multicriteria evaluation approach to set forest restoration priorities
   based on water ecosystem services
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Forest plays an important role in keeping water ecosystem services, such as drinking water provision. Thus, payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds. However, funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement. In this context, our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration, based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. For this, we have developed a decision-making support model for agricultural watersheds (in the Atlantic Forest region), based on mixed approaches, that were multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Participatory Technique. The model will help decision-makers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation. So, we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns. The base of the model was the following criteria, that were produced with high-resolution data and ranking in the Participatory Technique context, considering their importance for the study: proximity to spring, slope, soil erodibility, topographic index, and land-use/land-cover (LULC). The criteria were aggregated by the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method (an MCE method). The priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers (at most 200 m far from rivers), on the greatest slopes (>40%), on soils associated with high potential of erosion, and predominantly in agriculture lands. However, this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed (native forest covers 55% of its area) than in the watershed non-forested (native forest covers 25%). Another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class, which is a characteristic of the WLC method. Thus, areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds. We can conclude that for small watersheds, the MCE method, with high-resolution data, supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration, aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services. This way, our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide.

TI Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia as Potential Accumulators of
   Zinc and Copper in Water Ecosystem at City Area
SO ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
AB Two water plant species were analysed as potential accumulators of zinc and copper in water reservoirs in city areas. Moreover, water analysis were performed during the growing season to find some relations. Zn and Cu concentrations in water decreased at the outflow of Malta Lake. The contamination factor revealed very high values for Zn concentration in water, while Cu was at a low or medium level. Accumulation of both trace elements in plant organs was observed during the growing season in all plant organs. Zn bioaccumulation was found at lower level than Cu. Higher levels of both heavy metals were noted for belowground organs However, the translocation factor indicated that Zn were transported in the higher amounts to the above-ground parts of plants.

TI Estimation of real-time N load in surface water using dynamic
   data-driven application system
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Agricultural, industrial, and urban activities are the major sources for eutrophication of surface water ecosystems. Currently, determination of nutrients in surface water is primarily accomplished by manually collecting samples for laboratory analysis, which requires at least 24 h. In other words, little to no effort has been devoted to monitoring real-time variations of nutrients in surface water ecosystems due to the lack of suitable and/or cost-effective wireless sensors. However, when considering human health or instantaneous outbreaks such as algal blooms, timely water-quality information is very critical. In this study, we developed a new paradigm of a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS) for estimating the real-time loads of nitrogen (N) in a surface water ecosystem. This DDDAS consisted of the following components: (1) a Visual Basic (VB) program for downloading US Geological Survey real-time chlorophyll and discharge data from the internet; (2) a STELLA model for evaluating real-time N loads based on the relationship between chlorophyll and N as well as on river discharge; (3) a batch file for linking the VB program and STELLA model; and (4) a Microsoft Windows Scheduled Task wizard for executing the model and displaying outputs on a computer screen at selected schedules. The DDDAS was validated using field measurements with a very good agreement prior to its applications. Results show that the real-time loads of TN (total N) and NO(x) (nitrate and nitrite) varied from positive to negative with the maximums of 1727 kg/h TN and 118 kg/h NO(x) and the minimums of -2483 kg/h TN and -168 kg/h NO(x) at the selected site. The negative loads occurred because of the back flow of the river in the estuarine environment. Our study suggests that the DDDAS developed in this study was feasible for estimating the real-time variations of TN and NO(x) in the surface water ecosystem. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Sediment grain size effect on benthic microalgal biomass in shallow
   aquatic ecosystems
SO ESTUARIES
CT 3rd Annual Marine and Estuarine Shallow Water Science and Management
   Conference
CY DEC 01-05, 1996
CL ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY
AB Benthic microalgal biomass is an important fraction of the primary producer community in shallow water ecosystems, and the factors controlling benthic microalgal biomass are complex. One possible controlling factor is sediment grain-size distribution. Benthic microalgal biomass was sampled in sediments collected from two sets of North Carolina estuaries, Massachusetts and Cape Cod bays, and Manukau Harbour in New-Zealand. Comparisons of benthic micro:algal biomass and sediment grain-size distributions in these coastal and estuarine ecosystems frequently showed a negative relationship between the proportion of fine-grained sediments and benthic microalgal biomass measured as chlorophyll a. The highest sedimentary chlorophyll a levels generally occurred in sediments with lower percentages of fine particles (diameter < 125 mm). A negative relationship between the proportion of fine sediments and benthic microalgal biomass suggests anthropogenic loadings of fine sediment may reduce the biological productivity of shallow-water ecosystems.

TI Determination of priority areas and principal environmental factors for
   water ecosystem health remediation
SO ECOHYDROLOGY
AB Globally, the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems has attracted wide concentrations of scholars and governments, and how to wisely remediate the damaged ecosystem is a hot issue. Determination of prior areas is critical for ecosystem remediation. However, there are very few systematically feasible methods available for comprehensively addressing the issue, and consequently, the benefits of water ecosystem remediation projects are reduced. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for determining priority areas based on phytoplankton response to environmental factors. Phytoplankton constitute the main component of global aquatic biomes and water blooms. The effects of water ecosystem remediation projects are highly related to phytoplankton. First, we identified the dominant species of phytoplankton using a dominance accumulation model. Then, we determined the main environmental factors of phytoplankton using detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Afterwards, we calculated the adaptability of a single species to all principal environmental factors and the responsiveness of all dominant species to a single environmental factor using methods of integrated habitat suitability index and multispecies-based habitat suitability index. On the basis of these results, we finally developed a new model of the suitability of aquatic biomes to habitat factors (IHSIA) whereby to determine the priority areas and the principal environmental factors by time-space coupling analysis. We applied the method to Jinan, a pilot city for the construction of a civilized ecological city in China. The results indicated that waters in urban areas are priority areas for remediation; principal environmental factors in both the whole study area and the priority areas for phytoplankton are NH3-N, water temperature, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen where the NH3-N is the most urgent environmental factor to be remediated in the study area. Reducing the concentration of NH3-N can facilitate phytoplankton biome remediation. We found that dominant phytoplankton species can reflect the actual status of phytoplankton populations and can provide important reference data for global aquatic life research; space-time scale is an important factor in selecting principal environmental factors; limiting environmental factors that are poorly adaptable to dominant species could help provide a new path for water bloom prevention; the newly proposed model IHSIA can make the ecological environment remediation more objective. These results can help water managers reduce the scale of phytoplankton biomes by adjusting the environmental factors. The presented framework can provide new ways for water bloom prevention and can serve as the theoretical and scientific basis for the high success rate of water ecosystem restoration projects across the world.

AB Airborne contamination by heavy metals and aluminum in freshwater ecosystems of the Kola Peninsula in subarctic Russia has resulted from smoke emissions from large plants such as the Severonikel and Pechenganikel smelters and the Kandalaksha aluminum plant. Negative effects are intensified by acidic precipitation. Nickel is a primary technogenic effluent in surface waters of the Kola North. The area of highest nickel concentrations in water and lake sediments is limited to a 30-km zone around the copper-nickel plants; a similar situation exists for copper. Lake acidification increases the concentration of all metals in water, particularly aluminum. During flood times, a redistribution of metal speciation occurs that increases the concentration of more toxic metal species. We determined that there is a high intensity of metal accumulation in the organs of fish, and we discovered toxic effects, including specific pathologies and fish dysfunction. Based on this information, we estimated the critical levels of metals in freshwater ecosystems of the Kola North.

AB Urban water Ecosystem is threatened by its surroundings with urban area spreading, and the environment protection and water pollution control are the vital problems needed to be resolved in China. A totally analysis was made on the deficiency in flood protection standards, the shortage of water supply, the lack of ecological water demand, the deterioration of water environment, the decreasing proportion of water body invaded by buildings in city, the ignorance of scenery construction, culture demonstration and economy development related to water ecosystem. Aiming at these facts, an urban water environment and ecosystem construction mode, which integrates water security, water environment, water scene, water culture, and water economy, was put forward. It consists: water security system construction of flood control, water supply, ecological water demands, and water quality; restoration the spatial forms of rivers and lakes, water pollution control and water ecosystem restoration; water scene design; water culture exploitation and water economy activity development. And, in addition, experiments were taken to study the relationship between water body and microclimate in urban area. Furthermore, suitable water proportions in a large number of cities in China were proposed based on eight items through Fuzzy Evaluation Method. A practical example was applied in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province. According to the characters of water environment and ecosystem, an adaptable construction mode was established to make sure flood protection and other security items carried out smoothly, to develop technologies for pollutants control, clean water importing, and riparian plants rehabilitation which will be helpful for the improvement of water environment quality, and to lay out five water scene lines, water culture and economic exploitation sights, which can exhibit the distinguished synthesized characters of "mountains, rivers, reservoirs and sea" and will provide a comfortable, relaxed and natural spaces for travelers and residents. As for the severe pollution status in some of the urban rivers, clean water importing scheme was formulated to improve water quality and self-purification capability of these rivers.

TI Exposure of microplastics to organic matter in waters enhances
   microplastic encapsulation into calcium carbonate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Plastic pollution in water ecosystems is threatening the survival of wildlife. In particular, microplastics may be encapsulated into calcium carbonate, a crucial building block of hard tissue in many species such as molluscs, corals, phytoplankton, sponges, echinoderms, and crustaceans. Actually little is known on the effect of humic acids, a common component of dissolved organic matter, on the encapsulation of microplastic into calcium carbonate. Here, we precipitated calcium carbonate with humic acids and polystyrene microspheres. The precipitation process was followed by measuring pH during the reaction. Composition, structure, morphology, surface properties and microspheres encapsulation extent were analysed by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, total organic carbon analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering. Results show, for the first time, that encapsulation of polystyrene microspheres into calcite crystals occurs only after the treatment of the microspheres with humic acids, leading to encapsulation of about 5% of the initial microspheres mass. On the contrary, untreated microspheres did not encapsulate in calcium carbonate. Our findings imply that exposure of microplastics to dissolved organic matter in water ecosystems could result in enhanced encapsulation into the exoskeleton and endoskeleton of aquatic organisms.

AB In the course of human activities, most of the watercourses have turned into natural-technical systems. They must be considered as a whole and, based on this principle, environmental safety should be managed on them. Following a methodological approach based on the fact that the environmental safety level of water ecosystems is determined by their functioning which ensures the maintenance of a favorable environmental situation, technical safety of facilities hydraulically connected to the watercourse and responsible for observing the rights and interests of water users, will allow a comprehensive assessment of the actual situation on them. It is also appropriate to use it for development of a list of the best environmental and economic measures aimed at reducing the anthropogenic load on these water facilities. So, the measures proposed for the Maliy Salgir river water ecosystem (maintenance work on ponds and arrangement of centralized and decentralized water disposal systems in rural settlements Stroganovka, Denisovka, Ivanovka, Druzhnoye and Lazorevka) according to preliminary estimation will reduce the index characterizing the level of its environmental safety up to a value corresponding to the acceptable level of anthropogenic activities impact.

   TO PRESERVATION OF WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO HRVATSKE VODE
AB Since shortcomings of environmental protection system are also reflected in facilitating the incurrence of damage within a weak regulatory framework, there is a need to recognize inherent rights of the environment, of other species and water itself, outside of their usefulness to humans. The paper examines the concept of recognizing the rights of nature, analyses the Earth-centric approach to environmental protection, specifies the instruments for protecting the Earth rights, outlines environmental protection models for future generations, gives examples of judicial and administrative practice in exercising the rights of rivers and water ecosystems, and describes current efforts to recognize the rights of water resources. The authors emphasize the need and suitability of Earth-centric approach in environmental protection for preserving water resources of the Republic of Croatia and advocate that particular achievements of the new approach to environmental protection be incorporated in regulations issued by the central authority and local communities based on the best practice of the Earth-centric system.

TI Impact of Land-Use/Land-Cover Change on Drinking Water Ecosystem
   Services in Wami River Basin, Tanzania
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB Land-use/land-cover changes are considered the dominant form of anthropogenic pressure on the environment, causing changes in ecosystem service patterns and affecting water supply services. Using the spatial econometric technique, we analysed the impact of land-use/land-cover change on water ecosystem services for domestic use upstream and downstream of the Wami River Basin. The results in terms of land-use/land-cover classes during the study period (2011-2016) indicate that cultivated land showed maximum positive changes in both sub-catchments, while bushland and woodland showed maximum negative changes upstream and downstream. The results showed that bushland, woodland, cultivated land, and grassland were significantly correlated with water point characteristics in both sub-catchments. For functionality characteristics, a significant effect was observed in bushland and grassland upstream and downstream, respectively, while sufficient water was found in woodland upstream and grassland downstream. Moreover, bushland was observed to have a significant number of water points with poor quality of water upstream, and a substantial number of water points with good quality of water were found in grassland downstream. We found that all measured land-use/land-cover changes and water point characteristic correlations were statistically significant; therefore, we concluded that land-use/land-cover change affects the water ecosystem in the basin. These results could facilitate decision-making and development of related policies and might support finding sustainable strategies for water ecosystem services for domestic use.

TI A Study on Obtaining Waters to Restore the Water-ecosystem of Deokjin
   Pond in Jeonju: New Paradigm for Restoration of Urban Reservoirs
SO ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB The Deokjin Pond is one of the places representing Jeonju City's history but has the poor water quality. The pond has a storage of 88,741 m(3) and a drainage area of 3.77 km(2). It has been maintained only by the groundwater pumped from the upstream wells and the direct rainfalls on the water surface since the old streams replenishing the pond were turned into a part of the sewer system due to indiscreet urbanization. The lack of replenishing water as well as the organic-rich bottom sediment were suggested as two main causes deteriorating the water-ecosystem. In this study, possible measures obtaining waters for restoration of Deokjin Pond ecosystem are discussed. It is estimated that the present pond can be replenished about 32 times a year by the runoff when the drainage system in the watershed is recovered to a state before urbanization. To support this, the drainage system is compared with that of nearby Osong Pond, which shows relatively better water-ecosystem. Even though Osong Pond has a drainage area one-seventh of that of Deokjin Pond, its storage is more than the half of it. It is because its watershed has a near natural drainage system where the rain mostly infiltrates into soil and slowly discharges into the pond. Therefore, it is believed that the low impact development (LID), which is known as a technique restoring the water circulating system to a condition before development, would be helpful in obtaining waters required for Deokjin Pond ecosystem management.

AB In this paper, Ecopath with Ecosim 5.1 software is used to simulate the constructed water ecosystem of inland waterway. According to the characteristics of feeding relationship, the ecopath model of water ecosystem is divided into seven functional groups: phytoplankton, hydrophyte, zooplankton, herbivorous, omnivorous, polychaetes and detritus. By analyzing the important ecological parameters of the ecosystem, such as biomass, biomass / biomass, consumption / biomass, trophic level and ecological nutrient conversion efficiency, the software integrates the energy flow process of the ecosystem, the ratio of the total net primary production and the sum of all respiratory flows is 1.314, it's indicating that the ecosystem is equilibrium. The research method of this paper can be widely used to evaluate the stability of the ecosystem of the domestic river.

TI Assessment of ecosystem service flow and optimization of spatial pattern
   of supply and demand matching in Pearl River Delta, China
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Exploring the spatial flow pattern of ecosystem services and clarifying the transmission path between the supply area and the demand area will help to formulate more scientific and reasonable ecological protection policies. This paper takes the rapid urbanization area representing the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration as an example. Using Invest model to quantitative the assessment of the supply and demand of carbon sequestration services and water ecosystem services from 2000 to 2020, a spatial flow model of ecosystem services is constructed to clarify the spatial flow of regional ecosystem services pattern. In addition, the Geo-detector model is used to explore the driving factors of the supply and demand relationship of ecosystem services, and the spatiotemporal geographic weighted regression model is further used to analyze the temporal and spatial differentiation of the impact degree. Finally, based on the Bayesian belief network, the optimal state factor configuration is selected to optimize the spatial pattern, and the corresponding optimization strategy is given. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The supply of carbon sequestration services in the Pearl River Delta decreased gradually during 2000-2020, while the demand increased gradually. The supply of water ecosystem services increased first and then decreased, while the demand showed a downward trend. (2) In terms of spatial heterogeneity of supply and demand matching, the main driving factors of carbon sequestration services included night light brightness value, temperature and vegetation index; The main driving factors of water ecosystem services include night light brightness value, land use type and vegetation index. (3) In terms of optimal areas for supply and demand matching, carbon sequestration services were mainly distributed in Zhaoqing, Huizhou and Jiangmen; The optimal matching areas of water ecosystem service supply and demand were mainly distributed in Zhaoqing, Guangzhou, Huizhou and other cities.

TI IMPACTS OF FUTURE CLIMATE ON WATER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE WATERSHED
   OF THE RIVER HOMEM (NORTHWEST PORTUGAL)
SO FINISTERRA-REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE GEOGRAFIA
AB Ecosystems are under pressure, especially due to climate change, which reduces among others, the ability of ecosystems to provide water-related ecosystem services such as water supply and sod erosion control. The aim of this study, carried out in the Homem River basin (Northwest Portugal), was to assess how future climate alterations may influence the pro-vision of these ecosystem services. The Sod and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a hydrological model, was calibrated and validated for local watershed conditions (river discharge and monthly reservoir volumes). Future climate projections (2020-2050) were forced into SWAT, based on four regional climate models and two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results confirm that the SWAT model has a goodperformance in quantifying river discharge and reservoir water volume after calibration and validation. Climate change may affect water sup-ply by reducing annual water yield in the basin by 7% under RCP8.5 scenario by 2050, when compared to the historical period (1970-2000). There will be less water in the river in spring, summer and autumn and more water during winter. The reservoir water volume should decrease considerably, therefore reducing the potential of hydropower production, especially during summer. The sediment exportation would increase, especially under RCP8.5 scenario. These results are of high relevance for building adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change on water ecosystem services provision, taking into account nature-based solu-tions, particularly at the local level to support sustainable river basin management strategies.

TI Payments for Water Ecosystem Services in Latin America: A literature
   review and conceptual model
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Latin America has been a pioneer in the implementation of payments for ecosystem services (PES) and numerous schemes are now in place. However, existing reviews of this experience are mostly theoretical and/or qualitative. This paper presents a comprehensive, systematic and up-to-date compilation and review of the literature on Payments for Water Ecosystem Services (PWS) in Latin America, in which 310 PWS transactions within 40 different schemes are analysed. Firstly, we quantitatively describe and discuss their key characteristics. Secondly, we identify information gaps that need to be filled to allow a more accurate analysis. Finally, we contrast PES theory versus the reported evidence. Results are discussed in the form of key messages and a conceptual model to support better design, implementation and monitoring is proposed. Among other things, our meta-study shows that there is a certain mismatch between how PES schemes are presented in theory and how they are actually practiced or reported in the literature. This mis-match concerns issues at the core of the PES principles, namely service-action conditionality, service definition and payment negotiation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hydrology and water quality factors driving spatiotemporal analyses of
   zoobenthos in a pilot city in China
SO ECOHYDROLOGY
AB In water ecosystems, zoobenthos are one of the most important communities. Maintenance of healthy zoobenthos community is essential for water ecosystems remediation. Understanding the hydrology and water quality factors that drive the variation of zoobenthos is the priority for water ecosystems remediation. The present study used canonical correlation analysis to select the main habitat factors affecting zoobenthic communities based on field sampling of the river zoobenthos in the first pilot city for the construction of civilized water ecosystems in China-Jinan City. In addition, analysis was performed based on geoscience methods of Global Moran's I and Anselin local Moran's I spatial autocorrelation of main habitats factors. The results show that the key water quality physical factors affecting Jinan City zoobenthic communities were pH and conductivity; the key water quality chemical factors were K+, Na+, and permanganate index; and the key hydrological factor was water depth. The sodium ions and conductivity exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation in all seasons. And the regions exhibiting spatial autocorrelation were generally stable. Moreover, the characteristics of benthic animals are closely related to human activities of domestic sewage discharge in the central and agricultural activities in northern parts of the study area. All methods in this paper can be extended to the researches on other communities, for example, algae, zooplankton, and fish in water ecosystems. The methods and results in the paper can provide significant references for managers to protect and restore degraded water ecosystems in global water.

TI Environmental factors affecting Phragmites australis litter
   decomposition in Mediterranean and Black Sea transitional waters
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Leaf litter decomposition rates in aquatic ecosystems arc known to be related to many abiotic and biotic factors.
   2. Field experiments were carried out during spring 2005 in 16 ecosystems, each with four sampling sites, using the litter bag technique to investigate the influence of abiotic factors on patterns of reed litter breakdown in different physiographic, hydrological and physico-chemical gradients occuring in transitional water ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea.
   3. Significant differences in leaf litter decomposition were observed among the studied ecosystems along univariate gradients of tidal range, water temperature, salinity and sinuosity index.
   4. Overall. 71% of variance in the litter breakdown rate was explained by the hydrological, physico-chemical and physiographic components. Specifically, tidal range, salinity and siuosity index are among the key factors in the most commonly used typological schemes for classifying transitional water ecosystems (i.e. Confinement Concept and Venice System), due to their influence on abundance and distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates and other guilds.
   5. The patterns observed at the regional scale of the study suggest that certain key abiotic factors are likely to play a major role as drivers of plant detritus decomposition process, through their influence on the overall metabolism of microorganisms and benthic macroinvertebraes.
   6. These observations have implications for the identification of reference conditions for transitional water ecosystems in the studied area, on which all processes of classification and conservation of their ecological status are based. Copyright (c) John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Urban ponds as hotspots of antibiotic resistome in the urban environment
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The occurrence, dissemination and assembly processes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban water ecosystems are far from being understood. Here, we examined the diversity and abundance of ARGs in urban water ecosystems including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city, China through high-throughput quantitative PCR. A total of 237 ARGs were identified, where multidrug, aminoglycoside and beta-lactamase resistance genes were the most abundant. Urban ponds had a comparatively high diversity and large numbers of shared ARGs with IFs and EFs. The average absolute abundance of ARGs (1.38 x 10(7) copies/mL) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (4.19 x 10(6) copies/mL) in ponds were only one order of magnitude lower than those of IFs, but higher than those of EFs and reservoirs. Stochastic processes dominated the ARG community assembly in IFs and ponds due to the random horizontal gene transfer caused by MGEs. These results imply that urban ponds are hotspots of ARGs. We further identified 25, 3, and 11 indicator ARGs for tracing the ARG contamination from IFs, EFs and ponds, respectively. Our study represents the first to highlight the role of urban ponds in the dissemination of ARGs.

TI Analysis of Susceptibility to Degradation of Water Ecosystem Services as
   a Tool for Land Use Planning: a Case Study in a Small Brazilian
   Watershed
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Mapping priority areas for environmental conservation and restoration is essential to informing policy formulation and decision-making. This study proposes a methodology based on multicriteria analysis and on-site assessment to develop environmental zoning that enhances the provision of water ecosystem services (WES) from Brazil's agua Quente River Basin. Integrated analysis of multiple criteria enabled identification of degrees of susceptibility to degradation, assessment of effects of land-use changes between 1990 and 2020, and validation of the study's methodology via field protocol. The results indicated that the spatial and temporal patterns of WES susceptibility to degradation varied little within the study area with the most critical levels occurring primarily in the Agua Quente's floodplain, where there are sandy textured soils and coverage with a low degree of soil protection. Zoning analysis designates 40% of the basin`s area as consolidated use, 28% for environmental conservation, 19% as anthropic use, and 13% for environmental restoration. Field analysis indicates that the occurrence of degraded areas and pollution by solid waste and urban effluents are relevant factors that affect the basin's water resources. Linear regression analysis indicated a good fit between the data modeled by the multicriteria analysis and those observed on-site (R-2 = 0.6 p < 0.05). The study's method is effective and its structure can be used in other river basins, as its approach is simple and flexible and can be readily adjusted to fit the characteristics of the study site.

TI Methodology to assess the ecotoxicological risk by pesticide pollution
   for surface water ecosystems using models and GIS.
SO HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO XENOBIOTICS
CT 11th Symposium on Pesticide Chemistry
CY SEP 11-15, 1999
CL CREMONA, ITALY
AB In the present work a methodology for ecotoxicological risk assessment by pesticide pollution for surface water ecosystems is presented. The approach requires the use of models and GIS. The study area is the potentially arable area of the Lombardia Region. For a number of selected agricultural chemicals the PEC values are calculated using two different modeling approaches and referred to geographical units. Analysis of PEC and toxicological effects on representative organisms of the water ecosystem provides a TER evaluation. The study of the exposed ecosystem is performed developing a Surface Water Sensibility Index (SWSI). The comparison between hazard index based on TERs and SWSI generates an ecotoxicological risk index that assumes specific values for every considered water body and input scenario. The use of the ecotoxicological risk cartography, produced by following the proposed methodology, could provide decision makers with suggestions about territory management related to the environmental impact of the agricultural activity.

TI Plastic pollution in water ecosystems: A bibliometric analysis from 2000
   to 2020
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Previous researchers have broadly studied plastic pollution in the water ecosystem worldwide, but the research topics development and performance trends in this study area are still insufficient and unclear. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore research trends regarding plastic pollution in the water ecosystem. Data of publications output was identified based on the Web of Science (WoS) database's research articles from 2000 to 2020. This study used VOSviewer to analyse collaboration networks among authors, countries, institutions, and co-occurrence analysis of keywords in three defined periods. A total of 2182 papers in plastic pollution in water ecosystem research were identified. The USA has been in a top position in plastic pollution in water ecosystem research moving from 2 output publications in 2000 to 68 output publications in 2020. Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) was ranked first in terms of the total publication output (105 publications, 4.81%). Most previous studies in Phase I (2000-2006) and Phase II (2007-2013) emphasise plastic pollution studies in marine environments compared to freshwater ecosystem-focused research. However, in Phase III (2014-2020), researchers more focused on plastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, estuary and inland water. The valuable results obtained from this study can help scholars better understand the research development trends and research hotspots in the field of plastic pollution in the water ecosystem and provide direction for future research.

SO NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
AB Information on the presence of Pinna nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Mediterranean Sea is largely reported in literature because it is an endemic and, at the same time, endangered species. Besides, this record contributes to enlarge the spatial distribution of this species in the South-East Italian coastline (Adriatic Sea). P. nobilis is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive (1992). In particular, P. nobilis has been recorded for the first time in the Aquatina Lagoon, a transitional water ecosystem included in the NATURA 2000 site "Aquatina di Frigole" (IT9150003). Therefore, this finding underlines the role of transitional water ecosystems as "nursery habitats" for P. nobilis as well as the relevance of conservation actions introduced by the EU with the NATURA 2000 network for preserving the biodiversity.

TI Peculiarities in Thermodynamics of Intrabasin Processes in Fresh-Water
   Ecosystems under Anthropogenic Impact
SO DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
AB In order to study the effect of pollutants on intrabasin processes, a series of nature experiments has been made in natural model ecosystems (mesocosms). The intensity of photosynthetic production and organic matter destruction have been studied as generalized thermodynamical parameters of the state of the ecosystem. On the basis of the ratio between destruction and overall production, dynamical phase patterns have been built. Analysis has shown that the dynamics of the state of the ecosystem described by these parameters corresponds to general regularities of the evolution of the state of dissipative systems. Consequently, the destruction-to-production ratio can be considered as a thermodynamic criterion for assessment in the evolution of the state of water ecosystems. On the basis of this criterion, and with the help of the approach proposed, methods of ecological load normalization can be elaborated.

TI Implementation of ecohydrology to support sustainable water resources
   management in tropical region, Indonesia
SO ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
AB Indonesia is a tropical country with abundant water resources consisting of rivers, lakes, dams, swamps , flood plains. High pressure on these natural resources, mostly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change, tend to increase environmental degradation and water ecosystem deterioration. Various possible efforts need to be considered in order to overcome water related problems in the future. Ecohydrology application will be a use-ful tool in regulating water circulation, eroded soil transportation, water quality, quantity and availability , floods and drought risk. Implementation of ecohydrological concept at demonstration site scale in a tributary of the Saguling reservoir catchment, the upper Citarum watershed, Indonesia aims to facilitate different part of stakeholders to have best practices tools and field experiences in dealing with daily water ecosystem and environ-mental challenges. This study showed a very high erosion at internal demonstration site area, closely related to increase of river water turbidity. Meanwhile, developed modelling system may predict water and sediment yields, soil erosion and deposition sources in good performance, either within the demonstration site or the entire area of upper Citarum wa-tershed. Phytoremediation ponds constructed in the demosite demonstrated their ability to improve water quality through turbidity reduction up to 64%, 76%, 68%, 92%, and 88%, for Lemna, Landoltia, Salvinia, Pistia, Eichhornia respectively. Understanding and taking into account community characteristics will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implemen-tation around ecohydrology demonstration site in Saguling catchment area.

TI ECOLOGICAL RISKS AFFECTING THE VULNERABLE FISH FAUNA OF RIVERS IN WEST
   MACEDONIA (GREECE)
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB The running water ecosystems in Greece which include rivers and small torrents, recently face considerable environmental problems. The mountainous river ecosystems of West Macedonia (Northern Greece) lately present an important environmental degradation mostly because of the extreme use of their natural resources, the pollution they accept and the inappropriate management planning. Therefore, their sensitive fish fauna and their biological resources are disturbed and exhausted, mainly, with a negative impact in the total water ecosystem and the local socio-economic structure. This paper aims to determine the main environmental problems of the 15 mountainous rivers ecosystem affecting important risks for the fish fauna and the fish populations in West Macedonia region as the rivers Agios Germanos, Akritas, Geropotamos, Tetrapotamos, Aliakmon, Veneticos, Greveniotis,Arapitsas, Ladopotamos, Almopeos, Edesscos, Tripotamos, Loudias, Erigonas and Axios. An important number of the species of the fish fauna of these rivers ecosystem is protected from particular national and international laws and conventions. The findings of the study can support the planning of sustainable and rational environmental-friendly management and enhances the relations between biological resources and their habitats. The final results can contribute in the design of a total management plan for the protection of fish fauna in mountainous running waters in Greece.

TI Screening and mitigating major threats of regional development to water
   ecosystems using ecosystem services as endpoints
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Coordinating the coercion of human activities to the ecosystem is a continuous strategic concern. A practical way to conceptualize socioeconomic development and link it to ecosystem response is urgently needed. This study proposed a two-staged method to reveal the threats concealed in socioeconomic development and show the return of water ecosystem services to regulation measures. Eight threat indexes referring to scale, structure and efficiencies of industrial, agriculture and domestic sectors were designed to assess the threats caused by unsustainable development features, while four indexes for evaluating water supply, habitat provision, regulation and quality purification service of ecosystem were set up. For each threat index, the evaluation result is a relative value derived from comparison with a reasonable level. The major threats could be screened out by ranking threat indexes, so that unreasonable development dimension could be identified and subsequent regulation scheme be prepared. On this basis, with the targeted adjustment of socioeconomic development, corresponding improvements in water ecosystem could be expected and quantified. In the case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei District, the most remarkable threats include production inefficiency of the industrial sector and oversized population, of which degrees of deviation from reasonable levels exceed 70%. When all development dimensions were dragged to the suggested levels, the habitat provision and water supply service would witness the largest progress among four services, with the values rising from 0.49 to nearly 1. This method helps discover the critical defect of socioeconomic development in terms of ecosystem response and facilitate the decision maker to establish more sustainable initiatives.

SO JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The ultimate goal of the protection and restoration of water ecosystem is intended to facilitate the healthiness of ecosystems in rivers and lakes, and the basic premise of river healthiness is to ensure the ecological water demand of rivers. Shenyang City is the economic and cultural center of Northeastern China, and most rivers in the territory of Shenyang City are plagued with the ecology and environment problems such as dry-up of river way, wetland shrinkage and groundwater overdraft. In protection and restoration of water ecosystem, Shenyang City should first study the ecological water demand of rivers. In this paper, we first defined the connotation, composition and calculation method of ecological water demand of rivers and selected eight major rivers in Shenyang City for ecological water demand study and calculation according to the characteristics of the rivers and water resources conditions in Shenyang City. We calculated the basic eco-environmental water demand and consumptive water demand for evaporation and seepage of river ways respectively and thus obtained the total eco-environmental water demand for eight rivers. In total eco-environmental water demand of rivers, consumptive water demand for evaporation and seepage of river ways accounts for 51% and the eco-environmental water demand of rivers accounts for 49%.

SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB The present study deals with the determination of residues of selected antibiotics from the group of sulfonamides in water ecosystem. Samples of surface water and bottom sediments from two main rivers flowing through the Brno City, which is the second largest city of the Czech Republic, represented the investigated matrices. The target analytes included ten sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadoxine, sulfaclozine and sulfadimethoxine) that were isolated from samples using optimized methods. Concerning the water samples, solid phase extraction was used for pre-concentration and purification of the sample as well as for extraction of monitored sulfonamides. For the extraction of sediment samples, the method of pressurized solvent extraction was used; solid phase extraction was used for purification and pre-concentration of sediment extracts. Final identification and quantification were carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC/DAD). According to the obtained results the concentrations of residues of selected antibiotics were determined and thus the water ecosystem burden in selected rivers in South Moravian region was identified.

TI Microplastics pollution in China water ecosystems: a review of the
   abundance, characteristics, fate, risk and removal
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Microplastics pollution has been a focus for researchers in recent years worldwide, for the large quantities of plastics in production and the resistance to degradation. China's microplastics pollution attracts much attention because of its long coastline, large population and rapid economic development. This review addresses the widespread microplastics pollution in China's water ecosystems through available research results from recent years and analyses the abundance, characteristics, fate and risk of microplastics. This paper also discusses the current treatment technology of microplastics. The conclusions show that estuaries are severely affected by microplastics pollution; the accumulation of microplastics and adsorption of contaminants by microplastics could also lead to serious risks besides ingestion; there are few technologies that can efficiently remove microplastics pollution in sewage treatment plants. Finally, this review suggests directions for future research trends.

TI Calculation of Sustainability Indicators for Water Objects based on the
   Example of Water Use in the Arctic Basin of the Yenisei River
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In the article, the fractal approach to the description of nonequilibrium water ecosystems in their exploitation conditions is considered. The article demonstrates clearly that, in these conditions, the management of the development of water objects should be a precautionary provision, which should furthermore be reduced to the management of potential anthropogenic risks arising from a violation of the coevolution of anthropogenic and natural processes equivalent to the disruption in sustainability of the ecosystem in its exploitation conditions. The fractal approach opens up new opportunities for the assessment of water management based on the calculation of the fractal sustainability indicator (anthropogenic transformation) for water ecosystems that is directly related to the maximum permissible environmental load (MPEL).

AB Environmental sustainability of natural water ecosystems in the Aral Sea Basin has been upset in the past 40-50 years. Lack of a transparent water resources management strategy has resulted in deterioration of the nature manifested in desertification, land salinization, waterlogging, formation of brackish lakes in depressions, disappearance of natural lakes in delta and a general deterioration of quality of water resources. To assess environmental sustainability of water sources of various genetic types it is necessary to identify the criteria characterizing their basic ecological dualities with due regard for securing an acceptable habitat within which the key hydrobionts (taxons) could exist. Control over the content of the established basic ecological criteria on the basis of the selected parameters will permit to take the necessary measures to sustain the water-related ecosystems.

TI Bacterial processes of photosynthesis and dark carbon dioxide
   assimilation in the lakes of Bunger Hills oasis in eastern Antarctica
SO MICROBIOLOGY
AB Photosynthetic and dark assimilation of carbon dioxide was studied in both perennially and temporarily ice-covered lakes of the Antarctic oasis Bunger Hills. The intensity of these processes in the lakes studied varied from 0.08 to 326 mg C/(m(3) day) and correlated with water mineralization. Irrespective of the character of ice-cover, the chemical composition of water in Antarctic water ecosystems affected the organic matter photoproduction to a greater extent than the intensity of photosynthetically available radiation. With the method of polymerase chain reaction, the predominance of oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms carrying the RuBisCO genes was revealed in all the lakes examined. The results obtained and the literature data unambiguously point to the photosynthetic production of organic matter by cyanobacteria as the main biogeochemical process that determines all the other metabolic strategies in Antarctic water ecosystems studied hitherto.

TI Impact of landscape pattern change on water-related ecosystem services:
   Comprehensive analysis based on heterogeneity perspective
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB The transformation of surface landscapes by human activities is the main driving factor that affects changes in ecosystem functions and ecological processes, significantly influencing the ability of regional water ecosystems to deliver products and services to human society. However, the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and multiple water ecosystem services and the mechanisms of dynamic change remain unclear, posing challenges for managing and enhancing ecosystem services through landscape management decisions. Taking the Zishui basin as an example, this study aimed to clarify the impact of landscape heterogeneity on water-related ecosystem services and relationships by analyzing the relative importance and comprehensive impacts of landscape structure composition and landscape spatial configuration changes on three ecosystem services (water production, soil conservation, and water purification). These services were quantified for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 using the InVEST model. Furthermore, quantitative indices were constructed to assess the impact of landscape heterogeneity on water ecosystem services. The results show that annual water yield and soil conservation increased at first and then decreased from 2000 to 2018, with 24.48% and 22.50% overall decreases, respectively. In contrast, the total export of N and P decreased at first and then increased, with 3.65% and 5.18% overall increases, respectively. The contribution indices of landscape pattern changes to water yield, soil conservation, nitrogen export, and phosphorus export were 0.04%-2.02%, 0.08 x 10- 2%-0.32 x 10-2%, 13.57%-70.05%, and 11.01%-68.22%, respectively, showing interannual and spatial differences. The impact of landscape pattern change on water-related ecosystem services mainly reflects intensity change, which does not change the dominant relationships. Both landscape composition and configuration have impacts on water-related ecosystem services, but the effects of composition are larger than those of configuration. Among them, the proportions of cultivated land, woodland, and construction land, along with changes in Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED) have obvious influences on water-related ecosystem services and show nonlinear relationships. In summary, the impacts of landscape heterogeneity indicators on water-related ecosystem services have obvious category differences, interannual changes, and spatial differences. This study provides new insight into the driving effects of landscape pattern change on the supply of waterrelated ecosystem services and will provide a reference for practical land management applications and policy formulation of water ecosystem services.

TI Water Quality Assessment of Moraine Ponds and Their Role in Water
   Ecosystem of Selected Catchment Area of the Kashubian Lake District
SO OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
AB Assessment of water chemical properties for ten small moraine ponds within the catchment of the Borucinka river in the Kashubian Lake District was attempted. Additionally, influence of the selected environmental characteristics on functioning of these insignificant water ecosystems was evaluated. Ten ponds varying in terms of catchment usage structure, hydrologic type and size of surface area were selected for the studies. Impact of the catchment management on water quality was evaluated. In addition, it was verified if periodic changes in the reservoir hydrological function (incorporation into the surface runoff system) significantly affected the water quality. The results confirmed that the usage structure of small reservoir catchment had a decisive influence on the quality of the water. The principal cause of the increasing concentrations of the analyzed ions (Li+, Na+, NH4+, Mg-2(+), K+, Ca-2(+), F-, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3, PO43-, SO42-) was the neighborhood of farms. Seasonal changes in the nutrient (total nitrogen, total phosphorus) water concentrations were not observed. Significant changes in water quality by intermittently forming hydrographic network that interconnected the individual depressions were reported for total nitrogen only. Interestingly, the landlocked ponds, in theory continuously accumulating contaminants from the catchment area, were characterized by good hydro-chemical conditions.

The phosphorus model had been originally applied to the Lake Balaton (Hungary), and then to other water bodies - Ivan'kovskoe Reservoir, Lake Kubenskoe, Lake Uvildy (Russia), Lake Kuortaneenjarvi, Lake Tuusulanjarvi, Lake Kotojarvi (Finland), South-East part of Finnish Gulf.  An analysis of the combined simulation data for water bodies studied by the model allows us to estimate features of phosphorus changeability and its general load taking into account an external phosphorus input plus an internal phosphorus cycling into the water ecosystem.

TI ASSESSMENT OF TROPHIC STATE IN THE WATER ECOSYSTEM OF GJIROKASTRA
   DISTRICT, ALBANIA
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB The assessments of water and sediment qualities are considered as the best indicators for monitoring eutrophication in water ecosystems. Viroi Lake, in Gjirolcastra district (south part of Albania) was selected to evaluate eutrophication conditions during the years 2011-2013. The water and sediment samples were collected for quality evaluation. The following physico-chemical indicators of water: pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, nitrates (N-NO3-), nitrites (N-NO2-), ammonium (N-NH4+), total phosphor (TP), and the presence of microorganisms as Fecal sp. were estimated. Also, the texture, pH, CEC, carbonates (CaCO3), total nitrogen, total phosphor and humus of sediment samples were assessed. Furthermore, the concentration of heavy metals, such as Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd, were measured in sediment samples, as sensitive indicators of water ecosystems. Background values of heavy metals, given as 90th percentile, were used to evaluate the sediment pollution from heavy metals.
   Based on the obtained results, this ecosystem presented a trophic degree from oligotrophy to eutrophy. Microbiological analyses showed that Viroi Lake was polluted with microorganisms (fecal streptococci and fecal conforms). The sediments can be classified, using sediment quality guideline (SQG) of USEPA, as non-polluted or heavily polluted according to the occurrence of specific heavy metals.

TI The Nexus of Water, Ecosystems, and Agriculture in Endorheic River
   Basins: A System Analysis Based on Integrated Ecohydrological Modeling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB In arid and semiarid areas, the issues of water security, ecological security, and food security are tightly interlinked. Understanding the water-ecosystem-agriculture (WEA) nexus in such areas is critical to their sustainable development. This study presents a basin-scale integrated ecohydrological model and a paradigm for analyzing the WEA nexus through physically based modeling. The integrated model is successfully applied to the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest endorheic river basin in China. A system analysis of the WEA nexus in the HRB is performed using the validated model. The major findings are as follows. First, reducing the amount of irrigation water applied to the midstream of the HRB produces widely varying effects on the water balance of the basin. Second, a threshold of 11.5 x 10(8) m(3)/yr is found for the streamflow from the midstream region to the downstream region, beyond which the contribution of the streamflow to the recovery of vegetation is trivial in the short term. Third, the trade-off among water conservation, ecosystem protection, and food production in the HRB is strong, and it is highly sensitive to the water management strategy employed. Evaporative water-saving practices are more desirable than direct water-saving regulation of irrigation water from the perspective of the WEA nexus. Overall, the results of the study provide insights into the allocation of water resources, ecosystem conservation, and agricultural development in the vast arid and semiarid areas of the world.

TI How to Prioritize the Attributes of Water Ecosystem Service for Water
   Security Management: Choice Experiments versus Analytic Hierarchy
   Process
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The various ecosystem services related to water form a complex structure that impacts on human well-being so it is necessary to know the relationships between their attributes to support decision making for water security. Our work investigates individual preferences for water ecosystem service attributes in the Tilacancha River Microbasin, in northern Peru, using two methods of a different nature. In that context, prioritization results using Choice Experiments and Analytic Hierarchy Process are compared for their abilities to represent purchase preferences and theoretical preferences, respectively. Both methods reveal that in a context of abundant water resources, the public has a higher preference for the attributes Quality Maintenance and Water Regulation, over Sediment Control and Water Yield, which were less valued. The differences allowed us to identify possible applications of the results useful for water security management. Additionally, we conclude that it is possible to combine the results of both methods to support decision making, and we highlight the specific cases in which it is appropriate to use the methods individually.

TI Zooplankton in highly regulated rivers: Changing with water environment
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The Huai River Basin (HRB) of China is well-known globally for the extent of severe human activities (e.g., waste disposal and water project construction) which have resulted in severe water pollution and subsequently degraded water ecosystem quality in recent decades. However, influence of water pollution on water ecosystems has not yet been fully realized due to lack of water ecosystem data. In food webs of freshwater ecosystems, zooplankton occupy a critical position but they are highly susceptible to pollutants and temperature which in turn impact the community structure and biodiversity of zooplankton to a great extent. This paper aimed to assess impact of water chemistry variation on zooplankton through ecological-niche models and spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton along with water chemistry in the HRB. We investigated the impacts of nine dominant water chemistry indicators on zooplankton distribution and composition via ecological niche models based on water chemistry status and zooplankton communities at 71 typical sites of the HRB. A fuzzy clustering method (FCM) was employed to help study the impact characteristics and the spatial heterogeneity. Results indicate that across the nine water chemistry indicators, changes in water temperature has minimal impact on the zooplankton community of the Huai River while small variation in ammonia-nitrogen exerts significant stress on the community; with respect to water temperature and total phosphorous zooplankton species in the HRB are coexisting with little competition; as to spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton communities, communities in the southwest and southeast mountainous regions may adapt well to habitat variations, while those in the middle and northeast areas have a weak adaptability to habitat changes. We concluded that in highly polluted rivers with large spatial heterogeneity of water chemistry, like the Huai River, ammonia-nitrogen exerted great stress on the zooplankton community in nonlinear way with too high or low concentration of ammonia-nitrogen leading to reduction in abundance of zooplankton; zooplankton communities in the HRB is mainly impacted by pollutant instead of water-temperature. All these can provide scientific support for future restoration and wise water resources planning and management in the Huai River. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of Algicidal Bacillus mycoides on Diatom Ulnaria acus from Lake
   Baikal
SO DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB Algae-bacteria interactions play an important role in water ecosystems. In this work, the BS2-15 algicidal strain was isolated from the bottom sediments of Lake Baikal and identified as Bacillus mycoides on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing, its described ultrastructure, and biochemical properties. B. mycoides BS2-15 was demonstrated to have a strong algicidal effect against a freshwater diatom culture of Ulnaria acus, inhibiting its growth and increasing frustules fragility. By analyzing the impact of bacterial filtrate onto the cells of U. acus, we demonstrated that perhaps an algicidal compound is produced by bacteria independently in the presence of diatoms in a medium. Using methods of TUNEL and confocal microscopy, we revealed that the bacterial algicidal effect on the diatom cells results in DNA fragmentation, nucleus destruction, and neutral lipid accumulation. This phenomenon highlights the complexity of algae-bacteria interactions and their potential role in regulating water ecosystem microbial populations.</p>

TI Cyanobacterial Algal Bloom Monitoring: Molecular Methods and
   Technologies for Freshwater Ecosystems
SO MICROORGANISMS
AB Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) can accumulate to form harmful algal blooms (HABs) on the surface of freshwater ecosystems under eutrophic conditions. Extensive HAB events can threaten local wildlife, public health, and the utilization of recreational waters. For the detection/quantification of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, both the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Health Canada increasingly indicate that molecular methods can be useful. However, each molecular detection method has specific advantages and limitations for monitoring HABs in recreational water ecosystems. Rapidly developing modern technologies, including satellite imaging, biosensors, and machine learning/artificial intelligence, can be integrated with standard/conventional methods to overcome the limitations associated with traditional cyanobacterial detection methodology. We examine advances in cyanobacterial cell lysis methodology and conventional/modern molecular detection methods, including imaging techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/DNA sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), mass spectrometry, remote sensing, and machine learning/AI-based prediction models. This review focuses specifically on methodologies likely to be employed for recreational water ecosystems, especially in the Great Lakes region of North America.

TI Microsatellite loci for the invasive colonial hydrozoan Cordylophora
   caspia
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB Cordylophora caspia, a colonial hydrozoan native to the Ponto-Caspian region, has become a common invader of both fresh and brackish water ecosystems of North America and Europe. We describe 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci for this species. Preliminary analyses indicate that population substructure may contribute to departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In addition, new loci failed to consistently amplify Cordylophora samples known to be genetically distant from those utilized in this study, indicating the presence of cryptic diversity within the taxon.

TI Occurrence of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Vojvodina Water Ecosystems
SO GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
AB During a brief survey (summer 2005-spring 2006) of 16 water ecosystems in Vojvodina region regarding bloom events of potentially toxic and toxic cyanobacteria species, almost 60% of investigated water bodies were found in blooming. The most dominant detected bloom forming cyanobacteria species were Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Anabaena circinalis, A. planktonica, A. flos-aquae, Microcystis flos-aquae, M. aeruginosa, Planktothrix (Oscillatoria) rubescens, all belonging to potentially toxin or toxin production species, microcystin being the most frequently produced toxin. Following detected blooms, concentrations of chlorophyll a were also indicative for a very high primary productivity of investigated localities and high algal biomass development. Detected environmental situation deserves immediate attention by authorites in charge for preserving the environmental quality. Mass presence of the potentially toxic and toxic species represents latent and real threat to human and animal health, but also an important indicator of the rapid water quality deterioration which could represent challengable obstacle for the future development of the region. It is therefore imperativelly recommended that the basic principles of WFD, monitoring in particular, be immediatelly established in the region.

TI Spatial identification of conservation priority areas for urban
   ecological land: An approach based on water ecosystem services
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB How to effectively prevent land degradation and ecosystem deterioration in the process of urbanization has been the focus of land degradation researches in urban areas. Urban ecological land can be defined as the natural base on which a city relies to ecologically survive. It closely links the social economy with the natural eco-environment, providing an important integrated approach to resolve the contradiction between urban expansion and natural ecosystems conservation in the process of urbanization. The research question addressed in this study is how to accurately identify the conservation priority areas for urban ecological land. Taking Zhuhai City, located in China, as an example, an approach based on seven kinds of water ecosystem services was put forward, combining social demand and natural supply for the services to determine service targets and conservation priority areas. The results showed that the conservation priority areas in Zhuhai City covered 868 km(2), accounting for 51.03% of the total land area, which were mainly covered by woodlands or paddy fields and fish ponds. In addition, by synthesizing ecological importance and ecological sensitivity, management zones for urban ecological land were delineated, including 510 km(2) of primary control areas and 358 km(2) of secondary control areas. In the supply and demand view of water ecosystem services, this study put forward an integrated ecosystem-based approach for conservation priority area identification of urban ecological land, aiming to prevent land degradation and achieve urban ecological sustainability.

AB The possibility of introducing genetically engineered microorganisms (GEM) into simple cycles of laboratory water microcosms was investigated. The survival of the recombinant strain Escherichia coli Z905 (Ap(r), Lux(+)) in microcosms depends on the type of model ecosystems. During the absence of algae blooming in the model ecosystem, the part of plasmid-containing cells E. coli decreased fast, and the structure of the plasmid was also modified. In conditions of algae blooming (Ankistrodesmus sp.:) an almost total maintenance of plasmid-containing cells was observed in E. coli population. A mathematics model of GEM's behavior in water ecosystems with different level of complexity has been formulated. Mechanisms causing the difference in luminescent exhibition of different species are discussed, and attempts are made to forecast the GEM's behavior in water ecosystems. (C) 1999 COSPAR.

TI The worldwide research trends on water ecosystem services
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB In recent decades, the scarcity of water resources, the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and associated repercussions for other ecosystems have become major global challenges. In this context, research on water ecosystem services has become increasingly important. The objective of this work is to analyse the evolution of this line of research worldwide for the period 1998-2017. A bibliometric analysis showed that this line of research has been gaining relevance within the ecosystem services field. Exponential growth has been observed in such research, and more than 65% of the studies have been performed in the last five years. Economic analyses have little relevance and gradually have lost relative importance. Results show that the most used keywords during the studied period are Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Water Quality, Ecology and Climate Change. The highest contributing countries on this topic are USA, China, UK, Germany and Australia. The leading institutions in this research field are the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences and the Wageningen University and Research Centre. A high level of international collaboration is observed between the different agents involved in ecosystem services research and extensive cooperation networks. Three differentiated clusters have been detected around which this type of work is grouped: aquatic ecosystems, forest ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems. The interactions between different types of ecosystems must be investigated with respect to water, and holistic frameworks should be developed that integrate the different disciplines to achieve a more complete analysis of the set of services that contribute to the sustainable management of the different types of ecosystems.

TI Use of bioassays to develop monitoring of water ecosystem
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Bioassays approved by the State Standard (GOST) (Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia affinis) and new bioassays (the unicellular protozoan Paramecium caudatum and luminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum) were used to monitor the quality of purified municipal and industrial wastewaters (from the city of Krasnoyarsk and an integrated pulp-and-paper mill). It was shown that all invertebrates tested were similar in their sensitivity to pollution, and their sensitivities were higher than that of luminescent bacteria. However, unicellular organisms can be used successfully for analysis of water quality if instrumental methods are employed. This analysis is by several orders of magnitude more rapid than GOST bioassays and produces more reliable results.

TI Geographical distribution of zooplankton biodiversity in highly polluted
   running water ecosystems: Validation of fine-scale species sorting
   hypothesis
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Dispersal, rather than species sorting, is widely recognized as the dominant driver for determining meta-community structure at fine geographical scales in running water ecosystems. However, this view has been challenged by a recently proposed fine-scale species sorting hypothesis, where community structure can be largely determined by an environmental gradient formed by local pollution at fine scales. Here, we tested this hypothesis by studying community composition and geographical distribution of metazoan zooplankton in a heavily polluted riverthe North Canal River in the Haihe River Basin, China. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that the community composition of metazoan zooplankton differed significantly (p=.001) along the environmental gradient. Ammonium (NH4-N) was the leading factor responsible for changes in zooplankton community structure and geographical distribution, followed by total dissolved solid (TDS), Na, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature (T). Variation partitioning revealed a larger contribution of environmental variables (21.6%) than spatial variables (1.1%) to the total explained variation of zooplankton communities. Our results support that species sorting, rather than dispersal, played a key role in structuring communities. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) also revealed significant change points at both taxon and community levels along the gradient of NH4-N, providing further support for the influence of environmental variables on zooplankton communities. Collectively, we validate the fine-scale species sorting hypothesis when an environmental gradient exists in running water ecosystems at fine geographical scales. However, future studies on interactions between pollutants and zooplankton communities are still needed to better understand mechanisms responsible for the meta-community dynamics.

TI Methane emission from the coastal area in the southern Baltic Sea
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB In the shallow coastal area of the brackish water ecosystem of the Baltic Sea, between the Islands of Rugen and Hiddensee (Southern Baltic, Germany), methane emission was continuously determined with floating measuring chambers and automatic sampling equipment. Data were collected during six measuring periods in two years (1995, 1996).
   The evaluation of more than 5700 measuring series demonstrated very strong seasonal and interannual variations of methane emission, with extremely high rates in the range between 24 and 104 mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1) in June/July 1995, and the lowest values in the range between 0.03 and 0.11 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in October 1996. The highest single emission rate was 243 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Therefore this shore region represents, at least periodically, a hot spot for methane emission from a brackish water ecosystem into the atmosphere.
   The crucial controlling factor for the interannual and seasonal variations of methane emission and also for the small spatial differences was found to be the amount of organic matter in the sediment. This exerted a direct influence on methanogenesis and additionally indirect effects an oxygen dynamics and the relationships between methanogenesis and sulphate reduction.
   The significant correlation between methane emission and temperature in the water and sediment demonstrated that diurnal and long-term variations of emission rates during each season were mainly regulated by temperature. Only at low emission rates did other, indirect ecological factors become more important in controlling methane emission. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI Carp Breeding in the Carpathian Basin with a Sustainable Utilization of
   Renewable Natural Resources
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB In the Central European region, there is a long tradition of breeding fish in artificially constructed ponds. As the area belongs to the temperate zone, farmed fish need to survive cold winter periods. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), which is an omnivorous, bioturbating species, is well adapted to warm and cold periods and the alluvial water environment. Since the Middle Ages, a large scale, efficient carp farming methodology has been developed in the region, where production is based on natural resources (protein and fatty acid sources) of renewable water ecosystems. This summary aims to present this well-developed breedi:ng method through discussing aspects of hydrobiology and energy transfer through the food chain as well. Capabilities and effects of agro-technical treatments such as liming and organic manuring, zooplankton management and possible supplementary feedings are also reviewed. Analysing chemical processes of waters uncovers that biological production has no carbon footprint; no carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. In contrast, gaseous carbon dioxide diffuses into pond water containing calcium and/or magnesium, then it accumulates in algae production and, through energy migration to upper trophic levels, increases carp production. Thus, it can be declared that pond-farmed carp provides an environmentally friendly, delicious meat among products of animal origin.

TI E-Governance and Management of Inland Water Ecosystems Using Time-Series
   Analysis of Fishery Production
SO AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT:
   EMERGING RESEARCH APPLICATIONS
AB Governance of inland water ecosystems incorporates many components, such as the policy designation for the monitoring in a systematic basis of valuable biological parameters of the ecosystem regarding planning for the collection, assembly, organization, analysis, and dissemination of time-series fishery data in respect to forecasting for decision-making purposes from local and government stakeholders towards sustainability. E-governance engages an amplified dependence on stored data characterized by shared access to, and transmission of, in the form of digital data by public institutions using contemporary ICTs. Decision-making purposes for sustainable fishery management in inland waters whether at local, national, or regional levels, impose an improved forecasting process designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishery resources at levels which promote the objective of their optimum utilization and availability for future generations. Time series data concerning fishery production are often used in order to assess the present situation and consequently to forecast and enhance planning and consequently decision-making. ICTs new broadband Internet connections provide the middleware to effectively accomplish the goal of fishery data collection, their transfer to various government levels, higher levels or equal levels, the organization within a standard IT data structure, and further, the dissemination of either the results or the raw data.

TI Regional-scale application of the decision support system MOIRA-PLUS: an
   example of assessment of the radiological impact of the Chernobyl
   accident on the fresh water ecosystem in Italy
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB The present work illustrates the customisation and application of the decision support system MOIRA-PLUS (a MOdel-based computerised system for management support to Identify optimal remedial strategies for Restoring radionuclide contaminated Aquatic ecosystems and drainage areas) to the fresh water environment in Italy. MOIRA-PLUS is aimed at evaluating the behaviour of radiocaesium and radiostrontium in fresh water ecosystems and at assessing the appropriateness of suitable strategies for the management of contaminated water bodies by the application of multi-attribute analysis techniques. MOIRA-PLUS can be applied to complex networks of lakes, rivers and tributaries and can be straightforwardly customised utilising data and information from readily accessible sources such as official websites provided by scientific or government organisations. The present work shows an application of the decision system to 10 lakes and 18 rivers in Italy contaminated with Cs-137 of Chernobyl origin. Site-specific values of some aggregated transfer parameters were estimated for the most important Italian lakes. Although high values of fish and water consumptions were hypothesised, very low doses to public from the fresh water pathway following the accident were calculated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Contrasting Phytoplankton Structure and Morphologically Based Functional
   Groups of Reservoirs That Differ in the Adjacent Surrounding
SO CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
AB Increasing human activity has resulted in the transformation of waters and their landscape leading to fragmentation and degradation of natural ecosystems. We hypothesized that adjacent surrounding structures of water reservoir is weighty factor explaining changes in phytoplankton. The aim of the study was to find what level of identification is adequate to routine analyses and assess the best criteria that reflect structure of adjacent surrounding of reservoirs. Lithuanian and Polish reservoirs located in similar climatic conditions and of similar morphology were studied. The adjacent land use was described based on Corine Land Cover 2006. The physicochemical parameters of waters, structure and biomass of phytoplankton, Shannon index and obligatory autotrophic to mixotrophic species ratio were analyzed. The main difference between reservoirs was natural (Lithuanian reservoir: 67.8%) and agricultural landscape structure (Polish reservoir: 78.4%). Both ecosystems showed significant statistical differences in a few chemical features and in phytoplankton taxonomic and morphologically based functional groups (MBFG), Shannon index and autotrophic to mixotrophic species ratio. The dominant phytoplankton groups and MBFG better reflected stresses resulted differences of adjacent surrounding structure, compared with single species. In conclusion, the best criteria indicated the differences in the structure of adjacent surrounding of water ecosystems are MBFG and autotrophic to mixotrophic species ratio were presented.

AB Light is very important for water ecosystem, it was attenuated because of absorption and scatter caused by suspend sediment, chlorophyll and colored dissoluble organic matter(CDOM) in water. Water remote sensing reflectance is an important parameter for ocean color remote sensing, which has good relation with water quality. Measure underwater spectrum has significance application value for water ecosystem research and water quality retrieval. This paper introduced the TriOS spectrum measurement system firstly, then use the in situ data collected by the system in Taihu Lake to retrieval suspended sediment(SS) concentration. First, under-water remote sensing reflectance(Rrs(0(-))) was calculated by using the underwater spectra, then transform the Rrs(0(-)) into Rrs(0(+)) based on water-air interface transmission model, after that analysis the relativity between SS concentration and Rrs(0(+)), and finally suspend sediment retrieval models were developed. Compare different models, in order to select an optimal model for retrieving SS concentration. The result indicates that: Rrs(0(+)) has good relationship with the logarithm of SS concentration(Ln(SS)). In spectral region 500nm-600nm, there present negative correlation, and present well positive correlation in spectral region 620nm-882nm. The maximal correlation coefficient locates at band 743nm. Take Rrs(522), Rrs(743), Rrs(815) as independent variable to build SS concentration retrieval models, the retrieval results showed that logarithm model is better than other models, it can satisfied the require of practical application to certain extent.

TI Uptake of uranium by aquatic plants growing in fresh water ecosystem
   around uranium mill tailings pond at Jaduguda, India
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Concentration of uranium was determined in aquatic plants and substrate (sediment or water) of fresh water ecosystem on and around uranium mill tailings pond at Jaduguda, India. Aquatic plant/substrate concentration ratios (CRs) of uranium were estimated for different sites on and around the uranium mill tailings disposal area. These sites include upstream and downstream side of surface water sources carrying the treated tailings effluent a small pond inside tailings disposal area and residual water of this area. Three types of plant groups were investigated namely algae (filamentous and non-filamentous), other free floating & water submerged and sediment rooted plants. Wide variability in concentration ratio was observed for different groups of plants studied. The filamentous algae uranium concentration was significantly correlated with that of water (r = 0.86, p < 0.003). For sediment rooted plants significant correlation was found between uranium concentration in plant and the substrate.(r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Both for other free floating species and sediment rooted plants, uranium concentration was significantly correlated with Mn, Fe, and Ni concentration of plants (p < 0.01). Filamentous algae, Jussiaea and Pistia owing to their high bioproductivity, biomass, uranium accumulation and concentration ratio can be useful for prospecting phytoremediation of stream carrying treated or untreated uranium mill tailings effluent.

SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Individual Size has important implications for the physiology and ecology of phytoplankton. The analysis of Size Structure is a common approach for Studying structure Mid function of planktonic ecosystems. with applications for the monitoring and conservation of aquatic ecosystem health. Several ways to describe the size Structure of phytoplankton communities Lire used. including size-abundance relationships (SAR), non-normalized and normalized biomass size spectra (BSS). non-normalized and normalized number size spectra (NSS).
   2. The main goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of the different tools proposed for describing and monitoring phytoplankton guilds in transitional waters. Comparative analyses were undertaken to evaluate (a) the consistency of each tool in describing the phytoplankton guilds. in terms of statistical significance and agreement with theoretical expectations: and (b) the effectiveness of cacti tool to discriminate conditions/cases.
   3. Eleven transitional Water bodies occurring;110111 the eastern and western coasts of the Adriatic Basin were sampled in autumn 2004 and spring 2005.
   4. Results obtained highlight that: (1) NSS globally showed higher statistical goodness of fit than BSS: (2) slopes of BSS and NSS, both normalized and non-normalized, were less negative than expected following the linear biomass hypothesis: find (3) the non-normalized NSS shape descriptors were best able to discriminate environmental heterogeneity both between and within transitional water ecosystems.
   5. Parameters of NSS are suggested to be consistent descriptors of phytoplankton size structure and potentially important tools for monitoring and conservation of transitional water ecosystems. Copyright,(c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI Development Potential Discussion of Agricultural Water Ecosystem in
   China Using the Specific Surface Area Method
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The study of landscape pattern is the main content of landscape ecology. The landscape metrics method is an important method to study landscape pattern and is widely used landscape ecology. In the process of its calculation, landscape patches are regarded as planar existence. However, the actual landscape and its patches are all three-dimensional, and the calculation using only the plane will ignore some features of the landscape, so that the calculation results may be biased. Therefore, in order to restore the three-dimensional characteristics of the landscape, this paper tries to introduce the method of calculating the specific surface area of the landscape in order to add a new, more accurate method for the study of landscape pattern. The results show that the specific surface area of farmland is the largest and its effect on the ecosystem is the most significant. At the same time, if the height of patch type (such as buildings) changes, the specific surface area value will change accordingly, and the importance of each plaque will also change. However, the results calculated by the landscape index method cannot reflect the corresponding changes.

TI Where Do Ecosystem Services Come From? Assessing and Mapping Stakeholder
   Perceptions on Water Ecosystem Services in the Muga River Basin
   (Catalonia, Spain)
SO LAND
AB Reductions in water availability and increasing rainfall variability are generating a narrative of growing competition for water in the Mediterranean basin. In this article, we explore the distribution and importance of water resources in the Muga River Basin (Catalonia, Spain) based on key stakeholders' perceptions. We performed a sociocultural evaluation of the main water ecosystem services in the region through stakeholder interviews and participatory mapping. The basin was generally perceived as a hotspot of ecosystem services, but we detected varying opinions and considerable differences in the perceptions of importance and spatial distribution of water ecosystem services. These discrepancies were linked to the varying levels of stakeholders' dependence on water. Our findings are important for contributing to correct water planning and management in the river basin, which is a complex water social system marked by conflicts between different stakeholder groups vying for the same resource. This complex situation requires bottom-up strategies to create transparent, participatory decision-making models.

TI Calculating e-flow using UAV and ground monitoring
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Intense human activity has led to serious degradation of basin water ecosystems and severe reduction in the river flow available for aquatic biota. As an important water ecosystem index, environmental flows (e-flows) are crucial for maintaining sustainability. However, most e-flow measurement methods involve long cycles, low efficiency, and transdisciplinary expertise. This makes it impossible to rapidly assess river e-flows at basin or larger scales. This study presents a new method to rapidly assessing e-flows coupling UAV and ground monitorings. UAV was firstly used to calculate river-course cross-sections with high-resolution stereoscopic images. A dominance index was then used to identify key fish species. Afterwards a habitat suitability index, along with biodiversity and integrity indices, was used to determine an appropriate flow velocity with full consideration of the fish spawning period. The cross sections and flow velocity values were then combined into AEHRA, an e-flow assessment method for studying e-flows and supplying-rate. To verify the results from this new method, the widely used Tennant method was employed. The root-mean-square errors of river cross-sections determined by UAV are less than 0.25 m, which constitutes 3-5% water-depth of the river cross-sections. In the study area of Jinan city, the ecological flow velocity (VE) is equal to or greater than 0.11 m/s, and the ecological water depth (HE) is greater than 0.8 m. The river ecosystem is healthy with the minimum e-flow requirements being always met when it is close to large rivers, which is beneficial for the sustainable development of the water ecosystem. In the south river channel of Jinan, the upstream flow mostly meets the minimum e-flow requirements, and the downstream flow always meets the minimum e-flow requirements. The north of Jinan consists predominantly of artificial river channels used for irrigation. Rainfall rarely meets the minimum e-flow and irrigation water requirements. We suggest that the water shortage problem can be partly solved by diversion of the Yellow River. These results can provide useful information for ecological operations and restoration. The method used in this study for calculating e-flow based on a combination of UAV and ground monitoring can effectively promote research progress into basin e-flow, and provide an important reference for e-flow monitoring around the world.

TI Water ecology emergy analytic system construction and health diagnosis
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB The water competitions between human and nature pose a health problem of the water ecosystem. The relationship and health level of a water ecosystem, which are an important basis, are explored to formulate the sustainable development strategy of human society and natural ecology. The study proposes a new water ecology emergy (WEE) analytic system that comprises five main components: input module, storage module, output module, addition module, and consumption module. Based on the emergy theory, we have realized the quantification of ecological-economic flow inside and outside each module and converted each energy to emergy. Given this, the WEE analytic system health diagnosis indicators are proposed, including emergy interaction ratio, economic-social benefit ratio, ecological-environmental benefit ratio, water resource value, and sustainable development indicator. The comprehensive diagnosis method is the minimum information entropy (MIE) combination weighting method based on entropy and variation coefficient, which can comprehensively diagnose the health level of the system. Taking Luoyang, China as an example, the results show that for the WEE analytic system, the input module, output module, storage module, and consumption module were deteriorating, and only the addition module had a good trend. The health diagnosis results also show that the health level decreased year by year in the initial stage (2010???2015) and fluctuated and increased in the later stage (2015???2019). The main reason for the improvement of the system health level is the increase in the ecological-environmental benefit ratio. Harmonious development of human society and natural ecology, which consider the dual objectives of ecological-environmental protection and economic-social development, realize the benign operation of the water ecosystem and the sustainable utilization of water resources.

TI Effects of land use on thermal enrichment of urban stormwater and
   potential mitigation of runoff temperature by watershed-scale stormwater
   control measures
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Stream temperature is critical to the survival and reproduction of fauna in cold-water ecosystems. Urbanization causes abrupt increases in ambient stream temperature via stormwater inputs while concurrently decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Relatively little is known about how various urban land uses affect thermal load discharged to streams or whether a network of green infrastructure retrofitted at the watershed scale can ameliorate these impacts. Runoff temperature and hydrology were monitored at 17 urban and two forested watershed outlets to assess 1) how urban land use affects stormwater thermal pollution and 2) if thermal pollution can be mitigated through infiltrating stormwater control measures (SCMs). Significantly and substan-tially larger runoff temperatures (i.e., event mean temperature, event maximum temperature) and thermal loads were observed from every urban land use (without SCMs) in comparison to forested (i.e., surrogate for pre-development) conditions. Event mean temperatures generally followed the land use trend of parking lot > light industrial > commercial > heavy industrial > multi-family residential, single family residential > low density residential > forest. Retrofitted bioretention cells and permeable pavements were not successful in mitigating runoff temperature in residential watersheds compared to (1) watersheds without SCMs or (2) restoring temperature to surrogate pre-development conditions. SCMs were seldomly able to mitigate enough runoff volume to have a significant thermal load reduction compared to watersheds without SCMs. These results suggest stormwater management and cold-water species management have not yet been successfully integrated. More work is needed to optimize green infrastructure SCMs design for sufficient treatment of runoff to protect cold-water ecosystems from urban development. Beyond SCM implementation, wholistic watershed management practices (e.g., riparian buffers, clustered imperviousness, underground storage/conveyance) are needed to stem thermal enrichment of streams and lakes by stormwater.

TI Spatio-temporal evolution of water-related ecosystem services: Taihu
   Basin, China
SO PEERJ
AB Water-related ecosystem services (WESs) arise from the interaction between water ecosystems and their surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. They are critical for human well-being as well as for the whole ecological circle. An urgent service-oriented reform for the utilization and supervision of WESs can assist in avoiding ecological risks and achieving a more sustainable development in the Taihu Basin, China (THB). Spatially distributed models allow the multiple impacts of land use/land cover conversion and climate variation on WESs to be estimated and visualized efficiently, and such models can form a useful component in the toolbox for integrated water ecosystem management. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model is used here to evaluate and visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of WESs in the THB from 2000 to 2010. Results indicate that water retention service experienced a decline from 2000 to 2005 with a recovery after 2005, while there was ongoing water scarcity in urban areas. Both the water purification service and the soil retention service underwent a slight decrease over the study period. Nutrients export mainly came from developed land and cultivated land, with the hilly areas in the south of the THB forming the primary area for soil loss. The quantity and distribution of WESs were impacted significantly by the shrinkage of cultivated land and the expansion of developed land. These findings will lay a foundation for a service-oriented management of WESs in the THB and support evidence-based decision making.

TI Variability of Lekanesphaera monodi metabolic rates with habitat trophic
   status
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Regulation of metabolism is a common strategy used by individuals to respond to a changing environment. The mechanisms underlying the variability of metabolic rates in macroinvertebrates are of primary importance in studying benthic-pelagic energy transfer in transitional water ecosystems.
   Lekanesphaera monodi is an isopod endemic to transitional water ecosystems that can modify its metabolic rate in response to environmental changes. Therefore it is a useful model in studying the influence of environmental factors on metabolism.
   This study focused on the interpopulation variability of standard metabolic rates (SMR) in L monodi populations sampled in three transitional water ecosystems differing in their trophic status. The standard metabolic rates of L monodi individuals across the same range of body size spectra were inferred from oxygen consumption measurements in a flow-through respirometer in the three populations and a body condition index was assessed for each population. Habitat trophic status was evaluated by monthly measurement of the basic physical-chemical parameters of the water column in the ecosystems for one year.
   Standard metabolic rates showed high variability, ranging from 0.27 to 10.14J d(-1). Body size accounted for more than 38% of total variability. In terms of trophic status, individuals from the eutrophic ecosystem had significantly higher standard metabolic rates than individuals from the other ecosystems (SMR = 2.3 J d(-1) in Spunderati Sud vs. 1.36 J d(-1) in Alimini and 0.69 J d(-1) in Acquatina). The body conditions index was also higher in the population from the eutrophic ecosystem.
   Results show that standard metabolic rates and growth rates are directly related to habitat productivity in accordance with the expectations of the food habits hypothesis. A possible extension of this hypothesis to benthic invertebrates is proposed. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Differentiation of inland Ulva flexuosa Wulfen (Ulvaceae, Chlorophyta)
   from Western Poland
SO OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB The macroalgae representing the cosmopolitan Ulva flexuosa Wulfen species have been found in inland water ecosystems of Europe since the mid-1800s. The presence of the Ulva genus in waters of inland salt marshes was explained by high salinity of water in such systems. However, Ulva flexuosa thalli were found in lakes and rivers having no supply from strongly mineralized sources, either of natural or anthropogenic origin. The study focused only on populations of Ulva flexuosa subsp. pilifera (Kutz.) M.J. Wynne and Ulva flexuosa subsp. paradoxa (C. Agardh) M.J. Wynne occurring in inland ecosystems isolated from seawater. The differentiation of inland U. flexuosa subsp. pilifera and subspecies paradoxa was assessed by using classical morphological data and molecular techniques. We found that only two subspecies of Ulva flexuosa Wulfen occur in inland water ecosystems of Poland. On the basis of the analysis combining morphological features with the ITS region and rbcL gene sequences, a small degree of differentiation of the two inland taxa was demonstrated. These two subspecies have high differentiation of the habitat niches. U. flexuosa subsp. paradoxa settled in habitats featuring high salinity levels, and the second subspecies pilifera occurred only in fresh waters.

TI INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON A MICROBIAL RIVER WATER ECOSYSTEM AND ITS
   SELF-PURIFICATION POTENTIAL
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
AB Self-purification in rivers is mainly conducted by microorganisms attached to the river bed. To enhance the self-purification capacity, several processes or technologies have been proposed to improve the river water quality and preserve biodiversity. From the environmental engineering perspective, finding influential parameters and their effective control are effective in improving river water quality. However, there are numerous parameters affecting the self-purification capacity of rivers, and quantitative evaluations of these parameters have not been completed. In this study, the influence of light on both the microbial river water ecosystem and its self-purification capacity were investigated. Lab-scale experimental facilities (artificial river) were set, and artificially contaminated river water was introduced to the system. Furthermore, through a mass balance analysis, we realized that the clean river water conditions might be affected more by sunlight compared to water contamination; this is due to the large relative intensity of organic carbon loading by photosynthesis.

TI Influence of the local abiotic environment, weather and regional
   nutrient loading on macrobenthic invertebrate feeding groups in a
   shallow brackish water ecosystem
SO OCEANOLOGIA
AB This study evaluated the extent to which depth, sediment type, exposure to waves and coastal slope inclination modulate the relationships between regional nutrient loading, weather patterns and the species composition and dominance structure of macrobenthic invertebrate feeding groups in a brackish water ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Baltic Sea. Irrespective of feeding function, the species composition and dominance structure of benthic invertebrate communities were determined by local abiotic variables such as exposure. depth and sediment type. Regional weather variables (average southerly winds, salinity, water temperature, ice conditions) either separately or interactively contributed to the variability of benthic invertebrates. Nutrient loading had significant effects on benthic invertebrates only in interactions with local abiotic or regional weather variables. Herbivores, deposit feeders and suspension feeders exhibited a stronger response to the studied environmental variables than carnivores. All this suggests that (1) the dynamic coastal habitats studied in this work are not very sensitive to shifts in nutrient loading and (2) local abiotic conditions and weather patterns largely define the observed biotic patterns. We believe that the benthic invertebrate time series will only be a better reflection of the nutrient loading signal if more years covering extreme events are included.

TI Regional suitability of virtual water strategy: Evaluating with an
   integrated water-ecosystem-economy index
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With growing populations and climate change, more regions around the world are prone to unprecedented water scarcity. The concept of virtual water is introduced in the Middle East, where one of the strategy to solve water scarcity is to import grain instead of grow grain locally. However, some researchers have argued that such virtual water strategy as a solution to water scarcity is fallacious failing to take regional socio-economic and environmental suitability into account. In this study, an evaluation index system of virtual water strategy was constructed from an integrated water ecosystem economy system perspective. The evaluation index system can reflect the co-relationship among water, ecosystems and the economy and the status of system, which consists of resources, technology, economy, society, and environment. Using the improved entropy weighting and fuzzy synthetic evaluation methods, regional suitability of virtual water strategy was assessed and classified into the following five grades: excellent, good, average, fair, and poor. Using the Heihe River Basin (HRB) as the case study area, the evaluation index system was applied to examine the regional suitability of virtual water strategy for each county in the river basin. Results showed the suitability degree of approximately half of the counties was 'excellent', while the other half was 'average', except for Jinta County whose suitability of the virtual water strategy was 'poor'. The results indicated that the suitability of the implementation of virtual water strategy is closely related to the economic development and ecological conditions. In addition, the study propels the evaluation of virtual water strategy, and enhances their persuasion in addressing water scarcity, identifying the feasibility in the arid and semi-arid regions worldwide.

AB Sustainable use and development of watersheds become a major target of the national, European and global strategies and policies for sustainable development.
   This is based on recognition that: (1) the lotic and lentic systems are major components of the biophysical structure of natural capital which play a key role in providing a wide range of resources (e.g. water, food resources) and services (e.g. flood detention, recharging and discharging aquifers; nutrient retention and release, trace elements retention); (ii) the structure, water quality and their functions - production, regulation, information and support - were modified and degraded, in all EU countries (including Romania) in a proportion ranging between 50-90% (Castro et al., 2002; Nivet and Frazier, 2004; Revenga and Kura, 2003; Vadineami et al., 2003); (iii) the water quality and the integrity or health of the lotic and lentic ecosystems are the results of long term integration of the cumulated stress of both human and natural pressures, acting at the watershed scales; (iv) there is a need to shift the former sectoral and reductionistic based management of water resources towards integrated/or ecosystem and adaptive management at the catchment scale (EU-WFD) and; (v) the management plans and decisions for sustainable use and development of watersheds have to rely on evaluation - in physical and monetary terms - of the impact of human pressures upon the water ecosystems structure and functions and, the quality and density of resources and services flows.
   Taking into consideration the above guiding requirements and the major social, political and economic changes emerged during more than 16 years of transition and negotiation of the EU accession and integration, the presentation is focused on the current status of the new emerging institutional, governing, legislative and administrative frameworks.
   A particular attention will be given to: (i) the 11 administrative units (hydrologic basins and watersheds) which cover the river network at the national scale; (ii) land use and landscape structure; (iii) water course management; (iv) major drivers and pressures impacting on water quality and water ecosystem health; (v) first classification of "water bodies" and assessment of their "ecological status"; (vi) former economic analysis and new requirements for "environmental and resource cost and benefit analysis", (vii) the current institutional framework including stakeholders network and their involvement; and to many difficulties the EU-WFD implementation process is facing as well as major emerging water policy issues and risks.

Using the turbidimetric method, the systems containing sodium water glasses of different moduli and selected nickel salts were studied. It was demonstrated that high turbidity values in the studied systems indicate the reaction of Ni2+ ions with silicate forms and that is why sodium water glasses can be used to remove Ni2+ ions from water ecosystems, for instance wastewaters.

TI Spatial-Temporal Variations of Water Ecosystem Services Value and Its
   Influencing Factors: A Case in Typical Regions of the Central Loess
   Plateau
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Water resources provide indispensable ecosystem services, which are related to human well-being and sustainable social development. Accurately measuring the water ecosystem services value (WESV), and then grasping its changing characteristics, is particularly important for solving water problems. In this study, the typical area of the central Loess Plateau location is taken as the research area. Based on remote sensing images and statistical data, the direct market method combined with the equivalent factor method was used to calculate the WESV including groundwater and surface water, which is of greatest originality. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics in 2010, 2015 and 2020 were analyzed. Then, four WESV driving factors including per capita GDP, population density, proportion of water areas, and water consumption were selected, and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to analyze the spatial distribution pattern and temporal variation of WESV's response to the influencing factors. The results showed that WESV experienced a process of first decreasing and then increasing, which was mainly caused by Yulin. For the composition of WESV, the proportion of provisioning services value has increased, which caused the proportion of regulating services value to decrease. The correlations between four factors and WESV were different. The distribution pattern of the influences was spatially heterogeneous, which showed regular variations over time. These results indicate the necessity of WESV's independent research and provide a realistic basis for ecological compensation in the Yellow River Basin.

TI Ecological degeneration of the Erhai Lake and prevention measures
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The water quality of Erhai Lake is good as a whole, but its decreasing trend is not optimistic; the water ecosystem of Erhai Lake has changed dramatically, showing an obvious degenerating trend. The main reasons for the ecosystem degeneration are as follows: inflow pollution load exceeding the water environmental capacity, not favorable water habitat for the propagation of submerged plants, and the weak management for the lake basin. To prevent the degeneration of Erhai ecosystem, two key problems should be solved: one is to reduce the inflow pollution load to prevent the increase of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the overlying water; and the other is to implement the ecosystem regulation, namely improve the stability and biodiversity of Erhai ecosystem by habitat improvement, ecological restoration and ecological regulation. In terms of the preventive measures against the Erhai ecosystem degeneration, the pollution source control in combination with ecosystem regulation should be taken as the focus. Pollution source control, habitat improvement, ecological restoration, ecological regulation and watershed management should be emphasized simultaneously. To be specific, the key tasks for preventing Erhai ecosystem degeneration include five points namely, the reduction of pollution loading into lake, adjustment of ecological fishery, restoration of submerged vegetation, watershed integrated management, and emergency treatment of water blooms.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
AB This paper describes the impacts of unplanned urban expansion and land surface change in the city of Bamenda in Cameroon, the underlying causes and the ecological and social implications. This expansion has placed great stress on forest, land and water ecosystems. Much of the city's rapid growth in population has been accommodated in informal settlements on steep slopes and flood plains, with little attempt being made to limit the risk of landslides, rapid erosion and flash floods. The paper ends with recommendations for protecting the remaining forest, for managing water resources and drainage systems and for ensuring that housing and other urban needs are met without jeopardizing the supporting ecosystems.

TI Mapping water ecosystem services: Evaluating InVEST model predictions in
   data scarce regions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB Sustainable management of water ecosystem services requires reliable information to support decision making. We evaluate the performance of the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield Model (SWYM) against water monitoring records in 224 catchments in southern Chile. We run the SWYM in three years (1998, 2007 and 2013) to account for recent land-use change and climatic variations. We computed squared Pearson correlations between SWYM monthly quickflow predictions and streamflow observations and applied a generalized mixed-effects model to evaluate annual estimations. Results show relatively low monthly correlations with marked latitudinal and temporal variations while annual estimates show a good match between observed and modeled values, especially for values under 1000 mm/year. Better predictions were observed in regions with high rainfall and in dry years while poorer predictions were found in snow dominated and drier regions. Our results improve SWYM perfor-mance and contribute to water supply and regulation decision-making, particularly in data scarce regions.

AB Present state of environment is widely affected by various impacts of man which significantly eliminate negative affecting of its influence on the environment. In the past this fact was not so implemented and thus there was uncontrolled escape of contaminants of organic, but also inorganic origin into various components of environment. The most sensitive component is water ecosystem and its close plates (base sediments, banks sediments and biosphere near the flows).
   River Nitra ranks among the most affected water ecosystems in SR that was in 1965 the recipient of sludge, that was by accident in Zemianske Kostolany uncontrolled spilled into the river with aftermath of long-term contamination of all sub-components in ecosystem, mainly by heavy metals (Hg, As, Pb, etc.).
   Soil contamination by Cd and Hg was analytically confirmed. The contents of these risk elements in soil extract of aqua regia 1.85 - 3.7 fold (Cd) and 4.57 - 36.3 fold (Hg) exceeded the limit values (0.4 mg.kg(-1) and 0.15 mg.kg(-1) respectively) given by the legislative. Other metals exceeding limit values were lead (1.064 - 1.072 fold), zinc (1.096 - 1.192 fold) and chromium (1.172 - 1.644 fold).
   From assessed soil content of heavy metals only bioavailable forms of Pb determined in soil extract by NH4NO3 2.0 - 3.3 fold exceeded the limit value 0.1 mg.kg(-1).

TI Phytoplankton Size Structure and Diversity in the Transitional System of
   the Aquatina Lagoon (Southern Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean)
SO MICROORGANISMS
AB The Aquatina Lagoon (Southern Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Ecoregion) is a transitional water ecosystem with great ecological and socio-economic interest. Anthropogenic activities around the lagoon (e.g., agriculture and tourism) and hydrology can affect the environmental quality and biodiversity of the lagoon. Herein, the dynamics and diversity of phytoplankton communities were studied before and after the opening of a new canal connecting the lagoon with the sea, by using different approaches based on an evaluation of the size and structure of the phytoplankton as well as the taxonomic analyses. The lagoon depicted time-related fluctuations in chemical-physical parameters. The phytoplankton trend was characterized by an increase in abundance and biomass in summer, when pico-sized autotrophs dominated. Generally, nano-sized phytoflagellates dominated the community, while micro-sized dinoflagellates and diatoms were less abundant. An increase in the phytoplankton taxa number was observed throughout the years. All the analyzed parameters were generally relatively homogeneous before the opening of the channel, while some quantitative differences among stations were observed in the second sampling period. Considering the statistical evidence, both environmental and biological parameters were affected by the "dilution" effect exerted by marine water inputs. This research supports the evidence that phytoplankton is a good indicator of the environmental status, and the obtained results contribute to the implementation of management strategies for the conservation of transitional water ecosystems.

AB The holistic theory is a basic concept in Water Resources Management, when subject to Sustainable Development principles. lt refers to an integrated management and coordination of the entirety of the actions and interventions, which regard the water ecosystem or parts of it, within a hydrological basin. This procedure is accomplished through the development and application of an overall Management Plan at a hydrological basin level.
   This concept was followed by the water resources management plan of the hydrological basin of the wider Volos area, which will be presented in this paper. The main objective is the choice of the best set, among others, of hydraulic projects, which will be able to reestablish the balance in today's deficient basin's water volumetric budget (future demand included). The decision making was based on a GIS tool and concerned the traditional water capture hydraulic projects on the one hand and the sustainable water saving measures on the other.

TI EFFECTS OF NATURAL ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION EXPOSURE IN INLAND WATER
   ECOSYSTEMS OF CHILEAN PATAGONIA
SO PHOTOBIOLOGY: PRINCIPLES, APPLICATIONS AND EFFECTS
AB Exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation has risen in southern Patagonia due to atmospheric ozone depletion. The available literature describes how natural ultraviolet radiation affects the ecosystems, and in aquatic environments ultraviolet radiation can penetrate the water column under conditions of low concentration of substances such as dissolved organic carbon which provide a screen effect by absorbing wavelengths corresponding to natural ultraviolet radiation. The present chapter is a description of literature about the effects of natural ultraviolet radiation in zooplankton populations and communities in the inland water ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia (38-51 degrees S). At the population level, two patterns have been observed: first, the effects in species with a low tolerance to natural ultraviolet radiation exposure, which corresponds with transparent species; and second, the effects in species with photoprotective substances that are tolerant to high levels of natural ultraviolet radiation. On the community scale it has been observed that under high exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation only tolerant species are present, and under oligotrophy it was observed that few species are tolerant, mainly calanoid copepods, which are dominant in zooplankton assemblages.

In the absence of light and oxygen, the microorganism was capable of fermenting carbohydrates accumulated during light exposure, forming acetate as the main product, and of anaerobic respiration using elementary sulfur as an electron acceptor and forming hydrogen sulfide. The only function of these physiological mechanisms apparently is survival of the organism, since no culture growth was observed under dark anaerobic conditions.

AB The practical implementation of the European Water Framework Directive has resulted in an increased focus on the hyporheic zone. In this paper, an integrated model was developed for evaluating the impact of point sources in groundwater on human health and surface water ecosystems. This was accomplished by coupling the system dynamics-based decision support system CARD-PLUS to the aquatic ecosystem model AQUA TOX using an analytical volatilization model for the stream. The model was applied to a case study where a trichloroethylene (TCE)-contaminated groundwater plume is discharging to a stream. The TCE source will not be depleted for many decades: however, measured and predicted TCE concentrations in surface water were found to be below human health risk management targets. Volatilization rapidly attenuates TCE concentrations in surface water. Thus, only a 30-m stream reach fails to meet surface water quality criteria. An ecological risk assessment found that the TCE contamination did not impact the stream ecosystem. Uncertainty assessment revealed hydraulic conductivity to be the most important site-specific parameter. These results indicate that contaminant plumes with mu gL(-1) concentrations of TCE entering surface water systems may not pose a significant risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Vulnerability of the North Water ecosystem to climate change
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High Arctic ecosystems and Indigenous livelihoods are tightly linked and exposed to climate change, yet assessing their sensitivity requires a long-term perspective. Here, we assess the vulnerability of the North Water polynya, a unique seaice ecosystem that sustains the world's northernmost Inuit communities and several keystone Arctic species. We reconstruct mid-to-late Holocene changes in sea ice, marine primary production, and little auk colony dynamics through multi-proxy analysis of marine and lake sediment cores. Our results suggest a productive ecosystem by 4400-4200 cal yrs b2k coincident with the arrival of the first humans in Greenland. Climate forcing during the late Holocene, leading to periods of polynya instability and marine productivity decline, is strikingly coeval with the human abandonment of Greenland from c. 2200-1200 cal yrs b2k. Our long-term perspective highlights the future decline of the North Water ecosystem, due to climate warming and changing sea-ice conditions, as an important climate change risk.
   The North Water polynya is a unique but vulnerable ecosystem, home to Indigenous people and Arctic keystone species. New palaeoecological records from Greenland suggest human abandonment c. 2200-1200 cal yrs BP occurred during climate-forced polynya instability, foreshadowing future ecosystem declines.

TI THE MICROBIAL FOOD WEB AND ITS SENSITIVITY TO EUTROPHICATION AND
   CONTAMINANT ENRICHMENT - A CROSS-SYSTEM OVERVIEW
SO INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE
AB The relative contribution to the pelagic carbon flux of bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton (APP), and heterotrophic nano- and microplankton is highest in pristine oligotrophic waters. Increased nutrient loading stimulates picoplankton production but reduces the importance of the microbial food web. Not all microorganisms are affected in the same way by eutrophication and contaminant enrichment. In contrast to bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, the APP was found to be highly sensitive to heavy metal contamination. The changing significance of the microbial loop has far-reaching consequences for the entire ecosystem including alterations occurring in the benthos. The structure and functioning of the microbial food web is similar in marine, brackish, and fresh-water ecosystems.

TI Microbiological indicators and sediment management
SO ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA
AB The Water Frame Directive 2000/60/CE underlines the importance of sediments and requests the creation of a European net (SedNet) for their management. Sediments play an important role for the river basin and offer a variety of habitats to many aquatic organisms. Microorganisms, such as Clostridia, are indispensable for a lot of symbiotic and pathogenic relationships with higher organisms and the disappearance of these communities could cause extinction of many species. Thus, Clostridia communities represent the most suitable microbiological indicators to characterize the ecological quality of sediments. The creation of SedNet may make it possible to develop a series of best recommendation in sediment management.

TI Ratio-independent prey preferences by an estuarine mysid
SO JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
AB The present study quantified prey preferences by adult males and females of the mysid Mesopodopsis wooldridgei fed the calanoid copepods Pseudodiaptomus hessei and Paracartia longipatella at varying proportions. Both sexes of M. wooldridgei showed a lack of prey switching and a strong preference for the smaller, less active P. longipatella irrespective of density. Given a lack of low-density prey refuge, this finding may have important implications for the distribution of P. longipatella in estuaries along the eastern seaboard of South Africa. Results of the present study contribute to a growing body of literature that suggests that selective predation may play an important role in structuring plankton prey populations in shallow water ecosystems.

TI Effect of Hypoxia on Sodium and Ammonium Acetate Toxicity for Daphnia
SO BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Exposure of Daphnia in degassed (boiled) culturing water (hypoxia simulation) led to solitary lethal outcomes after more than 24 h. Before this term, hypoxia had no appreciable effect on the toxicity of sodium or ammonium acetate salts. The sensitivity of daphnias to the lethal effects of the tested chemicals did not change under conditions of normal oxygenation and increased sharply (by two orders of magnitude) under conditions of hypoxia, loosing the linear relationship with toxicant concentration. Ammonium acetate toxicity more markedly increased under conditions of hypoxia than sodium acetate toxicity. These data should be taken into consideration when predicting the results of combined effects of toxicants on water ecosystems and on human organism.

TI Evaluation of InVEST's Water Ecosystem Service Models in a Brazilian
   Subtropical Basin
SO WATER
AB The biophysical modeling of water ecosystem services is crucial to understanding their availability, vulnerabilities, and fluxes. Among the most popular models, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) models stand out. While many studies have used them, few have assessed their performance. This study evaluates the performance of InVEST's Seasonal Water Yield, Nutrient Delivery Ratio, and Sediment Delivery Ratio models in a subtropical basin in southeastern Brazil on temporal and spatial scales, using 39 years of streamflow data, 29 for total phosphorus and total nitrogen, and 19 for total suspended solids. Statistical indicators R-2, PBIAS, and NSE, were also calculated. The performance of the models varied according to the type of simulated WES and analysis scales used, with the Seasonal Water Yield model demonstrating the best performance and effectively representing the spatial and temporal variability of the average annual streamflow. All models performed well in simulating long-term mean values when compared to observed data. While one should bear in mind the study's limitations, the results indicate that the models perform well in terms of relative magnitude, although their application in studies involving water-resource management and decision making is limited.

Analysis revealed significant differences between compared populations in 22 of 29 plastic variables. Ten variables displayed sexual dimorphism. For discriminant analysis, we used the nine characters with the highest discriminating capacity. Re-evaluation according to the particular localities classified correctly 92 % of males, and 98 % of females, respectively. The present study demonstrates through discriminant multivariate analysis that classical taxonomic studies in biometry may provide many possibilities for identifying the local strains of fish species or subspecies. These conclusion on bleak are briefly discussed.

SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Beached seabirds, mainly common guillemots Uria aalge, were collected on the Belgian coast during winter from 1990 to 1995, Concentrations of total and organic mercury, and of organochlorines (PCBs and pesticides) were determined in muscle, liver and kidney. They were high compared to summer data (up to one order of magnitude), and increased during winter. This increase is not due to changes of total body weight nor polar lipid content, and thus reflects an actual increase of the seabirds' contamination while wintering in the southern North Sea. The observed annual cycle can be understood by assuming differences in prey contamination: higher during winter in the southern North Sea ecosystem than during summer in the Atlantic water ecosystem.

TI The nexus of water, ecosystems and agriculture in arid areas: A
   multiobjective optimization study on system efficiencies
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB In arid areas, agricultural development can occur at the expense of ecosystem conservation and water quality. To balance the conflicting interests, the water-ecosystem-agriculture (WEA) nexus in such areas needs to be systematically addressed. In this study, a multi objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP) approach is proposed to model the synergies and tradeoffs in the WEA nexus. Using this approach, the impacts of changes in hydrological conditions, land use, and the water management regime on the economic, ecological, and environmental efficiencies of the agricultural system in Zhangye Basin (ZB) (a typical arid area in northwestern China) were assessed. The major study findings are as follows: First, the MOLFP approach can effectively identify solutions for optimization problems with multiple interrelated ratio-type objectives, and the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system. Second, in wet conditions, the agricultural system can be more profitable and environmentally friendly but less efficient in saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area. Third, the potential land-use conversion from croplands into fallow or built-up areas, as well as the new water quality regulation, may lead to co benefits of economic, ecological and environmental efficiencies. Finally, the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of crop planting makes the agricultural system in ZB exhibit good resilience to water, land, and food stresses. However, the resilience is seriously impaired under very dry conditions and dramatic land-use changes. Overall, this study lays out a new framework for addressing the complex WEA nexus through system modeling and provides insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in arid areas.

TI Solid waste composition and COVID-19-induced changes in an inland water
   ecosystem in Turkey
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The composition and abundance of solid waste and the effect of COVID-19 measures were studied in an inland water ecosystem in Turkey. Solid waste items were collected annually for 5 years from 2017 to 2021 from seven stations located in Borcka Dam Lake (B1-B4) and Murgul Stream (M1-M3) in the Artvin Province. The highest densities by number and weight were recorded at M3 in 2020 (5.72 items/m(2)) and M1 in 2020 (0.39 kg/m(2)), respectively. However, no significant difference in density was recorded (p < 0.05) between the years. Plastic was the most abundant waste material by number of items in all the stations with a percentage contribution varying between 25.47 and 88.89%. There was a considerable increase in medical items during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM results revealed visually and statistically significant differences in solid waste composition between the years and stations. The dissimilarity between the years was driven by plastic and medical waste. The main sources of solid waste were river transportation (22.93%), improper disposal (20.74%), aquaculture activities (16.42%), and recreational and tourism activities (14.72%). The results of our study can be a baseline for transportation models, local administrations, and non-governmental organizations. Besides, the current waste management measures in Turkey are not effective in preventing waste accumulation in inland aquatic systems such as the Borcka Dam Lake and Murgul Stream. Furthermore, these findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced solid waste composition and increased its abundance in the study area.

TI Total Arsenic, pH, and Sulfate Are the Main Environmental Factors
   Affecting the Microbial Ecology of the Water and Sediments in Hulun
   Lake, China
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Bacteria have the metabolic potential to produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which have important roles in biogeochemical cycling processes. However, for Hulun Lake and the rivers that enter into it, the bacterial community structures and their effects have not previously been widely studied, limiting our ecological understanding of this habitat. To address this, we have analyzed the bacterial communities in the water ecosystem of the Hulun Lake Basin. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing identified 64 phyla, 165 classes, 218 orders, 386 families, and 740 genera of bacteria across all samples. The dominant phyla in the central area of the lake were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria, while in all other areas, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were dominant. The microbial community structures were significantly affected by environmental factors [arsenic (As), pH, and sulfate (SO42-)] and their location in the lake. The species richness in the sediments of Hulun Lake was higher than in the water, and this ecosystem harbored the highest proportion of unclassified sequences, representing unclassified bacteria. This study provides basic data for future investigations into the Hulun lake ecosystem and for water microbial monitoring and protection measures.

AB The South African National Scientific Ecosystem Programmes, initiated in the early 1970s, were designed to provide a means by which multidisciplinary research could be co-ordinated in order to address specific complex environmental problems. Numerous aquatic ecosystem subprogrammes were co-ordinated by the Foundation for Research Development (FRD) under the auspices of the Inland Water Ecosystems Research Programme. This included studies of reservoirs (Hartbeespoort, PK le Roux, Wuras and Midmar), rivers (Pongola, Umgeni, Vaal) and wetlands. This paper presents an overview of several of these co-operative studies, discusses their overall impact on water resource management and also outlines some of the basic ingredients which are essential for any successful interinstitutional multidisciplinary co-operative research programme.

AB A healthy water ecosystem is particularly important in the Mekong River Basin, home to 75 million people who depend on its water for rice and fish production. Sound water policies will be needed to sustain current basin ecosystem services, balancing complex and often competing demands for water, including the instream uses of hydropower, navigation, wetlands, and fisheries, maintenance of ecosystems versus the offstream uses of irrigation, and domestic and industrial uses. The paper presents a simplified method and application to incorporate water values for fisheries and wetlands into an integrated economic-hydrologic river basin model to analyze alternative water-using strategies and their implications for riparian countries.

TI Adaptation to natural flow regimes
SO TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB Floods and droughts are important features of most running water ecosystems, but the alteration of natural flow regimes by recent human activities, such as dam building, raises questions related to both evolution and conservation. Among organisms inhabiting running waters, what adaptations exist for surviving floods and droughts? How will the alteration. of the frequency, timing and duration of flow extremes affect flood- and drought-adapted organisms? How rapidly can populations evolve in response to altered flow regimes? Here, we identify three modes of adaptation (life history, behavioral and morphological) that plants and animals use to survive floods and/or droughts. The mode of adaptation that an organism has determines its vulnerability to different kinds of flow regime alteration. The rate of evolution in response to flow regime alteration remains an open question. Because humans have now altered the flow regimes of most rivers and many streams, understanding the link between fitness and flow regime is crucial for the effective management and restoration of running water ecosystems.

However, industrial, agricultural and domestic water is discarded into rivers directly in many developing countries, since drainage systems have not been completely constructed. Water quality monitoring using radio-controlled submarine provide an opportunity to develop baseline monitoring system for river water ecosystem health indicator. We propose a design modification of radio-controlled submarine for river water quality monitoring. Our design consists of modification for navigation system by added external motor, IMU and GPS; modification of processing and control system by added micro controllers and mini pc, and modification of water sensors system.

TI Species, Abundance and Function of Ammonia-oxidizing Archaea in Inland
   Waters across China
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Ammonia oxidation is the first step in nitrification and was thought to be performed solely by specialized bacteria. The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) changed this view. We examined the large scale and spatio-temporal occurrence, abundance and role of AOA throughout Chinese inland waters (n = 28). Molecular survey showed that AOA was ubiquitous in inland waters. The existence of AOA in extreme acidic, alkaline, hot, cold, eutrophic and oligotrophic environments expanded the tolerance limits of AOA, especially their known temperature tolerance to -25 degrees C, and substrate load to 42.04 mM. There were spatio-temporal divergences of AOA community structure in inland waters, and the diversity of AOA in inland water ecosystems was high with 34 observed species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs; based on a 15% cutoff) distributed widely in group I.1b, I.1a, and I.1a-associated. The abundance of AOA was quite high (8.5 x 10(4) to 8.5 x 10(9) copies g(-1)), and AOA outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the inland waters where little human activities were involved. On the whole AOB predominate the ammonia oxidation rate over AOA in inland water ecosystems, and AOA play an indispensable role in global nitrogen cycle considering that AOA occupy a broader habitat range than AOB, especially in extreme environments.

TI How can top-down and bottom-up manipulation be used to mitigate
   eutrophication? Mesocosm experiment driven modeling zooplankton seasonal
   dynamic approach in the trophic cascade
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Eutrophication leads to algae blooms and reduces the transparency of water bodies, which seriously affects water quality and ecosystem equilibrium, especially in shallow water body ecosystems (SWE). Controlling foodwebs by manipulating fish and macrophytes provides a feasible method to mitigate the effects of eutrophication. The response of zooplankton as the primary consumer to biomanipulation is mostly conceptualized and lacks detailed observation. Mesocosm experiments that altered the biomass of planktivorous fish and macrophytes were set up and their boundary conditions were extended into a series of scenarios for modeling biomanipulation. Thus, this study utilizes a one-dimensional lake ecosystem model Water Ecosystems Tool (WET) which considered each zooplankton group: rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods, to predict the seasonal dynamic effects of biomanipulation on zooplankton in SWE, and the model results are analyzed in comparison with the mesocosm results. Observed data from mesocosm experiments set up in a temperate pond, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), macrophytes, zooplankton, and fish, were used to calibrate and validate the models. The modeled results showed that in spring and summer zooplanktivorous fish removal would increase all three categories of zooplankton and consequently cause a decrease of phytoplankton, whilst an increase in fish biomass would increase phytoplankton, and concomitantly water turbidity. However, in autumn, rotifers and phytoplankton increased in response to fish removal, but cladocerans and copepods decreased, 27% and 41%, respectively. Across all three vegetated seasons, increasing the biomass of macrophytes revealed a similar pattern: all three categories of zooplankton increased and phytoplankton subsequently decreased. Our study proposes a "fish-zooplankton-macrophytephytoplankton" trophic cascade and quantitatively predicts the dynamics of each zooplankton group under biomanipulation through this pathway, and provides support for establishing macrophyte beds and removing zooplanktivorous fish (in spring and summer) as an effective approach to mitigate eutrophication.

TI Integrated multi-objective optimization framework for urban water supply
   systems under alternative climates and future policy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sustainable implementation of an urban water supply system (UWSS) should achieve an optimum compromise among water ecosystem protection, climate change mitigation, and economic performance. This paper establishes an UWSS optimization framework by integrating a multi-objective optimization model with life cycle assessment and a water distribution system simulation model. The trade-offs among total cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and an extended water ecosystem impact (WII) objective are taken into consideration. The central area of Beijing City which is the main water-receiving area of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP), is chosen as a case study. A baseline scenario for 2012 and several future scenarios for 2020 and 2030 are implemented to investigate the influence of alternative climates and future policies on UWSS optimization. The outcome of this study indicates that the UWSS should be shifted towards an unconventional water-based supply system in the future. The share of contribution of the unconventional water supply is increased from 41% in 2012 to more than 70% in 2020 and 2030. This result can be drawn in all of the water-receiving areas of the middle route of the SNWTP. Moreover, alternative climates have influences on unconventional water utilization. Imported water through the middle route of the SNWTP is a preferable choice to augment the water supply in arid climates while reclaimed wastewater is more appropriate in moist climates. A decomposition analysis of the emissions reduction policies shows that the water demand control strategy is efficient in GHG emissions reduction while the water supply management strategy is efficient in WII reduction. Such a systematic analysis of an UWSS could provide sustainable and practical recommendations on water resource management in arid regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ecohydrodynamics of Cold-Water Coral Reefs: A Case Study of the Mingulay
   Reef Complex (Western Scotland)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.

TI Factors which shape the load of water ecosystems with mineral nitrogen
   runoffs in rural areas
SO OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB The present study of factors which affect the load of water ecosystems with mineral nitrogen compounds (N-NH(4) and N-NO(3)) was conducted in the Olsztyn Lake District and covered the time period from 1992 to 1999. Three capture basins were investigated: agricultural drained with a drain network, agricultural drained with a drainage ditch, and agricultural-forested drained with scattered drains and ditches. It was found that the concentration and load of mineral forms of nitrogen in waters running off from rural areas were closely dependent on meteorological conditions, the kind of artificial drainage system in use, and the type of land use in the catchment area. In waters carried away through the drainage systems, average annual concentrations of N-NH(4) ranged from 0.16 mg dm(-3) (the agricultural capture basin drained with ditches) to 1.09 mg dm(-3) (the agricultural catchment drained with a network of drains); the amounts of N-NO(3) ranged from 0.29 mg dm(-3) (the agricultural-forested catchment) to 8.06 mg dm(-3) (the agricultural catchment drained with a network of drains). It was also observed that a larger share of arable lands in the land use structure in a given catchment caused an increase in the load of N-NO(3) determined in drained waters. In addition, it was confirmed that the amounts of mineral nitrogen carried away with drained waters annually varied from 12.78 kg N (6.7 kg N on average) per 1 ha of an agriculturally used catchment, of which N-NO(3) was a dominant form (12.23 kg).

AB Following climate change and elevated nutrient loads the proliferation of annual filamentous macroalgae results in the accumulation of drifting algal mats in many coastal areas worldwide. The occurrence of the mats may significantly affect the structure and functioning of the benthic communities. We tested the importance of the benthic herbivores Idotea balthica, Gammarus oceanicus and the suspension feeder Mytilus trossulus on the decomposition of the common drift algae Pilayella littoralis and Cladophora glomerata in a brackish water ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. The field experiments were performed in April-May (29 d) and July-August (29 d, last checkpoint 70 d in autumn). The changes in dry weight, total nitrogen and phosphorus content of the macroalgae were examined with an average of 7 d interval. The results showed that algal decomposition was related to temperature and their net photosynthetic rates. The benthic invertebrates significantly affected the algal decomposition. However, the character of the effect depended on the algal and invertebrate species and the physiological state of algae. When algae were photosynthetically active M. trossulus, through the fertilizing effect of biodeposition, promoted the growth of the algae and hence, retarded the algal decomposition. On the other hand, in the presence of herbivores the complete breakdown of the drift algae was reached already within 30-40 d as compared to the control value of 70 d. G. oceanicus had stronger effect on P. littoralis whereas I. balthica contributed mostly to the decomposition of C. glomerata. It is concluded that herbivores significantly accelerate the decomposition of the drift algae whereas suspension feeders postpone the decomposition as far as macroalgae remain photosynthetically active.

The target analytes included ten sulfonamides: sulfaguanidine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadoxine, sulfaclozine and sulfadimethoxine. The optimized methods should be applied for the matrices as surface or waste water and bottom river sediment. The attention was first focused on optimization of the method for identification and quantification of selected sulfonamides using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC/DAD). The methods of solid phase extraction (SPE) and pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) were optimized for extraction, pre-concentration and purification of the matrices.

TI Revision of herbarium specimens of freshwater Enteromorpha-like Ulva
   (Ulvaceae, Chlorophyta) collected from Central Europe during the years
   1849-1959
SO PHYTOTAXA
AB This paper presents results concerning the taxonomic revision of Ulva taxa originating from herbarium specimens dating back to 1849-1959. A staining and softening mixture was applied to allow a detailed morphometric analysis of thalli and cells and to detect many morphological details. The study focused on individuals collected exclusively from inland water ecosystems (having no contact with sea water). Detailed analysis concerned the following items: structures of thalli and cells, number of pyrenoids per cell, configuration of cells inside the thallus, occurrence or not of branching thallus, shapes of apical cells, and shape of chromatophores. The objective of the study was to confirm the initial identifications of specimens of Ulva held in herbaria. The study sought to determine whether saltwater species of the genus Ulva, e.g., Ulva compressa and U. intestinalis, could have been found in European freshwater ecosystems in 19th and 20th centuries. Moreover, the paper presents a method for the initial treatment of voucher specimens for viewing stained cellular structures that are extremely vulnerable to damage (the oldest specimens were more than 160 years old). The use of a glycerine-based softening mixture allowed the detailed analysis of the anatomic structure of cells as well as the determination of the number and size of pyrenoids, i.e., some of the key taxonomic features of Ulva taxa. Most of specimens were identified as belonging to the species U. flexuosa. Marine species such as Ulva intestinalis or U. compressa were not confirmed to occur in the inland water ecosystems of Central Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.

TI EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON CELL SIZE
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATION
AB We present a simple nutrient-phytoplankton model that incorporates adaptive evolution and allometric relations. This model allows us to examine the patterns and consequences of adaptive changes in the cell size of phytoplankton under the effect of changes in water temperature. A theoretical study reveals that the ecological reproductive index can be used to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of the nutrient-phytoplankton model. Numerical analysis suggests that phytoplankton should evolve toward the small sizes typical of picophytoplankton as the water temperature increases. This study provides a framework for studying the adaptive evolution of phytoplankton cell size in water ecosystem.

We report here the differential expression of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) gill proteins corresponding to two contaminated environmental conditions: crude oil and offshore produced water. In order to evaluate and understand contaminants, effects and adaptive response of these organisms, we identified proteins using MS. The latter can be grouped into three main classes: proteins involved in the cellular structure, in metabolism, and in defence proteins.

TI Cs-137 and Pb-210 radionuclides in open and closed water ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
AB The aim of this study was to determine the level of radionuclide concentration in sediment cores in two different water ecosystems; one closed and one open. Based on this data the changes in these ecosystems were interpreted. Two sediment cores from the Dobczyce reservoir and the Smreczynski Staw Lake were collected and divided into 1 cm thick sub-samples. The samples were air dried and homogenized. The Cs-137 and Pb-210 (Pb-210(sup), Pb-210(total), Pb-210(uns)) concentrations were measured using gamma and alpha spectrometry. Results showed that the Cs-137 concentration in the Dobczyce reservoir is lower than in the Smreczynski Staw Lake. Total Pb-210 concentration in the Dobczyce reservoir was around 70 Bq kg(-1) and in the Smreczynski Staw Lake was about 500 or 1,200 Bq kg(-1) with the decreasing tendency in the sediment core. Sediments are very important constituents of water ecosystems. In spite of the young age of the Dobczyce reservoir, the Cs-137 and Pb-210 radionuclides were very useful in understanding of the processes which have taken place in these ecosystems. The estimated sedimentation rate indicated such processes as regular sedimentation, mixing of sediments or floods. In the Smreczynski Staw Lake the changes have reflected the changes which took place in the Tatra Mountains.

AB The Environmental Programme for Forestry (1994), New Forest Act and Nature Conservation Act (1997) are steering forestry in Finland towards greater attention to ecological sustainability. Concerning the impacts that forestry has on water ecosystems, current directives are based on abundant research knowledge, but preventative measures are still underdeveloped. This report presents the first results obtained on the use of overland-flow fields in preventing forest regeneration activities impacting on water-ecosystems. Following the completion of ditch excavation or mounding, Concentrations of solid matter in the water at the lower end of the overland-flow field were only 6% of those measured in the sedimentation ditch following the completion of ditching and mounding. Similarly, the total nitrogen concentration was 9% and that of total phosphorus 48%. The amount of leached soluble nutrients was also reduced. Soluble phosphorus was 11% and that of soluble nitrogen 20% of the levels in water in the sedimentation ditch. The results of this pilot study are encouraging. They provide a basis for recommending the use of overland-flow fields in water-pollution mitigation.

TI Grazing impacts on phytoplankton in South American water ecosystems: a
   synthesis
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB The role of grazing as a controlling factor of phytoplankton has an extensive debate in the literature. In this article, five mechanisms that have been explored as potential controlling factors of grazing influence on phytoplankton in South America are discussed and compared with other latitudinal works. The temperature impact on zooplankton is not conclusive, with planktivorous fish appearing as the main controlling factor of zooplankton size ranges. Fish grazing effects on phytoplankton look despicable, but the impact of exotic filter-feeding fish remains controversial. Microphagous rotifers and Copepoda nauplii affect phytoplankton by selective size grazing, while large Cladocera and Copepoda adults can control phytoplankton when they reach high densities in the absence of fish. Both groups mainly feed on small sizes, with microzooplankton having a higher impact on very small phytoplankton. Some contradictory evidence arises for large colonial and filamentous algae. Exotic invasive filter-feeding bivalves are selective grazers in experimental approximations. Corbicula fluminea feeds on smaller particles, does not have taxonomic preferences, and has lower densities in nature than Limnoperna fortunei. Their effect on nature is not fully documented. In sum, several aspects still need deep scrutiny to fully understand the role of grazing on phytoplankton in South America.

TI How Do Stakeholders Working on the Forest-Water Nexus Perceive Payments
   for Ecosystem Services?
SO FORESTS
AB Nowadays, great emphasis is placed on the relationship between forest and water because forests are considered as substantial sources of many water ecosystem services. The aim of this paper is to analyze the stakeholder opinions towards the relationship between forests and water and the potential development of water-related payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. The study is developed in the context of COST Action CA15206-PESFOR-W (Forests for Water) aimed at synthesizing current knowledge about the PES schemes across Europe. The stakeholder opinions were mapped out using a structured questionnaire consisting of 20 questions divided into four thematic sections. The data were collected through an online survey. The results showed opinions of 142 stakeholders from 23 countries, mainly from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. In order to analyze the collected data, the stakeholders were grouped in buyers, sellers, intermediaries, and knowledge providers. The survey results indicated that the most important category of water ecosystem services according to our sample of stakeholders is regulating services followed by provisioning services. Further findings pointed out the highest importance that shared values and direct changes in land management can have when designing water-related PES schemes. The role of public authorities and collective collaboration of different stakeholders, with emphasis on local and expert knowledge, are also identified as of crucial importance. The results show that stakeholder opinions can serve as a starting point when designing PES schemes.

AB Azolla microphylla is a tropical and subtropical fern with a length of 1.5-2.5 cm. Some genera can grow in brackish waters, but these biota are more commonly referred to as freshwater plants. Utilization of this macrophyte as fish and livestock feed (cattle, goats, ducks, ducks and chickens) have been introduced in some part of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to know the best way to adapt the fern into brackish water ecosystem and examine the potential for growth in such environment. In this study, two adaptation methods were performed, namely instant adaptation (IA) method and the step by step adaptation (SSA) method. A number of 25-liter plastic basin were filled with 20 1 of freshwater or sea water, salt marsh sediment (500 g) and fermented chicken manure (500 g) and used as experimental unit. In the IA approach, the water salinity was adjusted from the beginning at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppt, planted with fern and observed for 21 days. While in the SSA method, the fern was firstly grown on an experimental unit of 0 ppt for 7 days. Then the water salinity was increased of 1 ppt every 7 days, until day 49. All experimental units were observed daily. including; survival rate, absolute growth, total growth, doubling time, and histological observations of leaves, rhizomes and macrophyte roots. The study showed that in IA aproach, A. microphyla grew normally only in salinity 0 ppt (freshwater). In 5 ppt experimental unit, the organisms survived until day 14. Similarly, at 10 ppt, the macrophytes grew and branched up to day 7. While the treatment of salinity 15 and 20 ppt A. microphylla survived up to 5 and 3 days only, respectively. In SSA method, the fern grew well and the population increased until day 49 at salinity 6 ppt. From the study can be suggested that in case of growing A. mycrphylla in brackish water ecosystem, the organism can be cultivated at salinity below 6 ppt by using step by step method of adaptation.

SO INGENIERIA DEL AGUA
AB The associated problems with the massive growth of macrophytes in the Lower Ebro, has led authorities and managers to explore the possibilities to minimize their negative effects on the water ecosystem and associated water uses by removing them by means of controlled floods. The main goal of the present work is to evaluate the hydraulic behaviour of the macrophytes through numerical simulation (Iber model) and its comparison with field data, in order to design the most efficient flushing flows. For this purpose, roughness coefficient - water depth relations (constant, variable and variable with hysteresis) were used to calibrate the numerical model with field data. It was observed that the best fit occurred the variable type with hysteresis curves (different ascent and descent branches) were used.

TI Recognition of key regions for restoration of phytoplankton communities
   in the Huai River basin, China
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Healthy phytoplankton communities are the basis of healthy water ecosystems, and form the foundation of many freshwater food webs. Globally many freshwater ecosystems are degraded because of intensive human activities, so water ecosystem restoration is a burning issue worldwide. Selection of key regions for phytoplankton-related restoration is crucial for an effective aquatic eco-restoration. This paper presents a practical method for identification of key regions for phytoplankton-related restoration, using random forests (RFs) method to cluster sites based on dominance, biodiversity, water chemistry and ecological niche. We sampled phytoplankton for species richness and relative abundance and water quality in the Huai River basin (HRB), China to determine the phytoplankton communities' composition and structure and characterize of their ecological niches. A wider mean niche breadth of a species usually leads to a greater overlap with the niche of other species. Using these data and water quality indices, we identified the key regions for phytoplankton-related river restoration activities. Results indicate that our method for recognition of key regions is effective and practical and its application to the HRB identified the Northern Plain area as the key region for restoration. This area is severely polluted and contributes significantly to the HRB phytoplankton communities. Phytoplankton in this region is highly adaptable to environmental change and therefore will be relatively unharmed by environmental instability induced by restoration measures. During restoration, indices of water temperature, total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand can be altered with little negative influence on phytoplankton communities, but measures that increase ammonia-nitrogen concentration would be highly detrimental. These results will provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water ecosystem restoration and sustainable basin management in the HRB.

TI BACTERIA RESPONSIBLE FOR BIOLOGICAL PHOSP HATE REMOVAL FROM WASTEWATER
SO HRVATSKE VODE
AB Discharge of wastewater containing phosphates into natural receiving bodies accelerates the eutrophication process of water ecosystems. In order to preserve surface waters, increasing attention is paid to phosphate removal from wastewater down to very low concentrations. Polyphosphate- accumulating bacteria (PAB) are responsible for the process of biological phosphate removal from wastewater. In aerobic growth conditions, PAB accumulate dissolved phosphates present in wastewater in the form of insoluble intracellular polyphosphate granules. PAB include phylogenetically and taxonomically different groups of cultivable and uncultivable bacteria. Average removal of phosphates from wastewater depends on the capacity of a PAB species for intracellular accumulation of phosphates and numerousness of this species in activated sludge.

TI Prokaryotic footprints in urban water ecosystems: A case study of urban
   landscape ponds in a coastal city, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The urban water ecosystems, such as the landscape ponds are commonly considered under the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, which can lead to the deterioration of the water quality. The prokaryotic communities are considered as one of the best indicators of the water quality. However, there are significant gaps in understanding the ecological processes that shape the composition and function of prokaryotic communities in the urban water ecosystems. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of prokaryotic assemblages in water environments including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city (Xiamen), China, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results indicated that the ponds had higher alpha-diversity of prokaryotic communities than those in the reservoirs, while there were significant variations in the community compositions among ponds, reservoirs, IFs and EFs. Moreover, ponds harbored a significantly higher proportion of sewage- and fecal-indicator taxa than those in the reservoirs, suggesting the occurrence of exogenous pollution in the urban ponds. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the main ecological processes resulting in the divergence of prokaryotic community compositions between ponds and other environments, while dispersal limitation and variable selection played an essential role in the formation of unique prokaryotic assemblages in the reservoirs. Function predication analysis demonstrated that the ponds shared more similar functional profiles with IFs or EFs (e.g., chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, chlorate reducers, nitrate reduction and respiration) than the reservoirs, whereas dominance of photoautotrophy was observed in the reservoirs. Overall, this study provides a profound insight of the ecological mechanisms underlying the responses of prokaryotic communities in the urban landscape ponds to the anthropogenic disturbances.

TI The influence of abiotic factors on the bloom-forming alga Ulva flexuosa
   (Ulvaceae, Chlorophyta): possibilities for the control of the green
   tides in freshwater ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB Ulva species are characterised by the capacity to achieve rapid biomass increase, which results in the formation of "green tides", particularly in nutrient-rich seawaters. Over the last decade, formation of large-scale Ulva mats has been increasingly observed in freshwater systems in Central Europe. Mass development of Ulva in freshwater ecosystems presents a growing burden in spite of its economic benefits. This study explores the formation dynamics of Ulva flexuosa mats with respect to habitat conditions, using the examples of a number of water systems located in Poland. Elevated water temperature, pH and high concentration of sulphates are among the most important factors affecting biometric parameters of Ulva blooms. An evident disparity was observed between lotic water ecosystems and lentic water ecosystems, which differed in terms of chemical characteristics of the habitat and mat structure properties. In flowing water, U. flexuosa displays a definitely higher potential for blooms. On the other hand, mass occurrence of U. flexuosa in freshwaters is caused by the inflow of fecund waters, especially following intense precipitation in summertime, as well as by periodic increases in salinity, pH and sulphate levels. The study suggests that potential U. flexuosa blooms in landlocked ecosystems may be controlled by means of reducing the inflow of particularly sulphate-rich waters.

AB As it is widely known, Aral Sea region is referred to the ecological disaster zone on global scale. Aral Sea was quoted by the UNEP as one of the most staggering disasters of the 20th century. In the beginning of 1960s Aral Sea had water area more than 66 000 km(2), now total area of three Aral Seas makes less than 20 000 km(2), including Eastern Aral Sea (EAS) - less than 11 000 km(2), Western Aral Sea (WAS) - 5 000 km(2), Northern Aral Sea (NAS) - about 3 300 km(2). Now only NAS (Kazakhstan) has real chances for survival. Analysis of results of previous researches shows that there are 13 variants for preservation of water ecosystems in zone of the former Aral Sea. Researchers offer multi-alternative ways for problem's decision, we offer one (most expedient) variant. Our proposal is reduced to the opportunity of saving of WAS (Uzbekistan) and creation of artificial dynamical (flowing) ecosystem "Sea - River delta" ("WAS - Amu Darya River delta"). There is a line of concomitant factors for benefit for WAS preservation, in comparison with EAS: a) WAS has the large depths, smaller area and water volume; b) WAS' waters have smaller mineralization Offered idea has as compound part a connection of Western part of NAS with WAS, construction of channel "NAS-WAS" and dam, which will separate WAS from EAS. Idea's realization will be favorable for Kazakhstan also.

TI Water Ecosystem Services Footprint of agricultural production in Central
   Italy
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The appropriate implementation of the concept of Water-related Ecosystem Services (WES) in water resources planning can support the development of productive activities and, at the same time, sustain local ecosystems. However, such implementation it is only possible when both WES supply and demand are evaluated, eventually with a spatially explicit method, for gaining insights into the ecohydrological behavior of a basin and the anthropogenic pressures on the available water resources. Based on the integration of hydrological modelling and Water Footprint (WF) analysis, this study aims at developing a methodology to analyze both the supply and demand of WES, evaluating a Water Ecosystem Services Footprint (WESF) associated with the agricultural sector. The proposed methodology is based on a 3-tiered approach: 1) evaluating the WES demand determined by the agricultural sector using the WF Assessment methodology; 2) quantifying the WES supply by applying the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); 3) estimating the green, blue, and gray WESF through dedicated indicators in order to identify the main hotspots. The methodology is applied to a specific case study in the upstream part of the Arno river basin (Central Italy). By means of subnational WF statistics the green, blue, and gray WF of the agricultural sector is calculated, determining the spatial distribution of WES demand in the catchment. SWAT results quantify the available water resources, pointing out the blue/green surface water partitioning, where precipitation is divided into 25% runoff and 46% evapotranspiration, and the associated WES supply. Merging the results, the WESF spatial pattern is evaluated, properly identifying the most critical areas in the catchment. WESF represents an operative tool to look at agricultural water management from an ecosystem-based perspective, supporting the identification of the strategies to explore the sustainable coupling of biosphere and anthroposphere.

AB The benthic communities in some large tundra lake ecosystems of European Russia are well-studied, but information on zoobenthos in small shallow tundra lakes is still insufficient. This article presents original information on the taxonomic structure, species composition, and quantitative development of macrozoobenthos communities in 26 small lakes of the Malozemelskaya Tundra and Bolshezemelskaya Tundra areas (July 2000-2014). In regards to the quantitative indicators of abundance, these water bodies are similar to other small water bodies at these latitudes. The biomass variation in wide ranges among lakes is caused by different dominant taxa. The species composition of macrozoobenthos is diverse. Oligochaetes, mollusks, and chironomids are highly rich in species composition, which generally corresponds to the trend identified for other water bodies of the Arctic tundra area.

The maximum Hg-T loading, as indicated by Hg-T atmospheric deposition, Hg-T emissions, and sediment Hg-T concentrations, did not coincide with maximum MeHg concentrations in fish. Urbanized ecosystems were areas of high Hg-T loading but had low MeHg concentrations in fish. Controls on MeHg production and accumulation appeared to be related primarily to Hg-T loading in undeveloped areas, while ecosystem sensitivity to MeHg formation appeared to be more important in regulating accumulation of MeHg in the urban area.

AB Cities face acute shock like hurricanes and floods, and chronic stresses such as droughts, water shortages, urban floods, and urban using water. How cities can create a development model in which the water and environment can coexist to alleviate the problem with urban water has become a common problem faced by countries or cities. Sponge city construction becomes a possible option to meet these challenges. According to the dimensions of pre-assessment, this article constructs the sponge city assessment indicator which is divided into three aspects: water ecosystem, socioeconomic system, and institutional and mechanism system; then, the degree of importance and degree of satisfaction are applied as the evaluation framework for the fuzzy multiple criteria to perform the comparison between the government officials and the public regarding the evaluation to analyze group differences. The results are that the difference in the evaluation dimensions between the officials and the public is between 0.8 and 1, but there exists difference in the degree of importance of water management and water use, and in the degree of satisfaction with water development, water efficiency, and mechanism. This result is helpful to find the problems and provide a decision basis for the further exploration.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are central to the global water cycle, in local generation of freshwater flows, and the healthy functioning and resilience of other ecosystems. Freshwater security depends on healthy ecosystems. Current human threats to freshwater ecosystems include rapid infrastructure development and land-use change, inefficient water use and over-abstraction, and pollutants. These threats, combined with increasing demand for water resources, exacerbate the sustainable development challenge. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population may be living in conditions of severe water stress. It is essential to find solutions that provide for the maintenance of freshwater ecosystems while meeting human needs. This paper examines responses to three pressures to freshwater ecosystems: declining ecosystem services, hydropower and urban development. It explores opportunities for improved decision-making and enhanced resilience including: better evaluation of trade-offs and interlinkages; improved monitoring; decision-making that incorporates long-term perspectives and risks; and the leveraging of crises to advance change.

TI Assessment of renaturation measures for improvements in ecosystem
   services and flood risk mitigation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The present paper offers a contribution to the research on social acceptance of interventions aimed at water ecosystem improvement and flood risk mitigation through renaturation measures. A CE study has been implemented to assess trade-offs between attributes of alternative projects, including social costs deriving from proposed actions of renaturation of river flows. The aim of our approach is to investigate the role of attitudinal factors in the valuation of costs and benefits generated by renaturation measures. A Hybrid Latent Class (HLC) model is applied to the data, revealing the existence of two distinct groups, characterised by different valuations of the attributes of the project. It is found that class membership depends on latent attitudes toward environmental protection and risk perception. Our study confirms the fruitfulness of the HLC modelling approach in stated preference studies regarding ecosystems valuation, as it provides a richer understanding of public preferences and allows more finely targeted policy indications.

AB A multidisciplinary complex of numerical models FRESCO (Finish-Russian-EStonian COoperation) simulating atmosphere-hydro-ecosystem dynamics is presented. The methodology of numerical treatment based on splitting with respect to physical and biochemical processes is used and offline calculation of ecosystem components is implemented. The hydroecological modelling complex is applied to study the plankton spatial development during its growth period in the Muuga Bay of the Baltic Sea and the Lake Peipsi. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the implemented numerical technique. The calculation results suggest that the ecosystem component behavior peculiarities are caused by the combined effect of upwelling and turbulent mixing. For example, this coupled phenomenon forms stretched plankton clouds in the western part of the Lake Peipsi.

SO MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS
AB We investigated the existence and characteristics of ammonia oxidizers in Permian water from Midland Basin. Molecular surveys targeting the amoA gene showed that only ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) exist and have potential activity in this special environment. In contrast, no ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were detected in the water. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 72-89% of the total screened AOA clones were affiliated with those found in underground water, and 10-24% of the AOA clones were related to those found in marine water or sediments. Our results indicate AOA might be the most abundant ammonia-oxidizing microbes in this ecological niche.

TI Some like it cool: Benthic foraminiferal response to Paleogene warming
   events
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Long-term climatic trends of the Paleogene were interrupted by global perturbations of the carbon cycle, commonly associated with warming of surface and bottom waters and ecosystem disturbance. Most of these perturbations occurred in the Paleocene - Eocene greenhouse climate, but others were superimposed on the transition of greenhouse-to- icehouse conditions during the middle to late Eocene. Here we analyze deep-sea benthic foraminifera to focus on the impact of Paleogene warming events on ocean bottom water ecosystems. We compare changes in assemblage diversity (Fisher-alpha index) across nine warming events at 16 locations (ocean drilling sites and land sections; 25 case studies) by applying the Epps-Singleton and Fligner-Killeen non-parametric statistical tests. Generally, diversity decreased whereas the coefficient of variation increased during warming events, but not all changes were statistically significant. The declines in diversity may have been due to adaptation to stressed conditions, whereas the higher coefficients of variation may have been caused by unstable environmental conditions. The most severe events, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, -56 Ma) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2, -53.7 Ma), had a higher impact on bottom water ecosystems, as shown in major drops in diversity. Regression analysis of data for ODP Sites 1262 and 1263 (SE Atlantic) shows that only up to 62% of the variability of benthic foraminiferal diversity at these sites depends on delta 13C and delta 18O values, indicating that changes in diversity were not exclusively determined by the magnitude of the events as defined by the magnitude of changes in carbon isotope excursion and temperature. No major changes in diversity were identified during middle Eocene warming events, and post-event diversity became significantly more stable, suggesting that the overall cooler middle Eocene conditions supported higher faunal diversity and stability of benthic foraminiferal assemblages.

TI Benthic Habitat Mapping Using Multispectral High-Resolution Imagery:
   Evaluation of Shallow Water Atmospheric Correction Techniques
SO SENSORS
AB Remote multispectral data can provide valuable information for monitoring coastal water ecosystems. Specifically, high-resolution satellite-based imaging systems, as WorldView-2 (WV-2), can generate information at spatial scales needed to implement conservation actions for protected littoral zones. However, coastal water-leaving radiance arriving at the space-based sensor is often small as compared to reflected radiance. In this work, complex approaches, which usually use an accurate radiative transfer code to correct the atmospheric effects, such as FLAASH, ATCOR and 6S, have been implemented for high-resolution imagery. They have been assessed in real scenarios using field spectroradiometer data. In this context, the three approaches have achieved excellent results and a slightly superior performance of 6S model-based algorithm has been observed. Finally, for the mapping of benthic habitats in shallow-waters marine protected environments, a relevant application of the proposed atmospheric correction combined with an automatic deglinting procedure is presented. This approach is based on the integration of a linear mixing model of benthic classes within the radiative transfer model of the water. The complete methodology has been applied to selected ecosystems in the Canary Islands (Spain) but the obtained results allow the robust mapping of the spatial distribution and density of seagrass in coastal waters and the analysis of multitemporal variations related to the human activity and climate change in littoral zones.

TI Homogenization of Macroinvertebrate Assemblages and Asiatic Clam
   Corbicula fluminea Invasion in a River of the Arid Patagonian Plateau,
   Argentina
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB The invasion of the Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea in South America has already reached Patagonia. Despite the well-known direct and indirect impacts that this species exerts on fresh-water ecosystems, particularly on benthic communities, few studies have been undertaken on its effect on the composition and structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages. This study evaluated the effects of the invasion of the Asiatic clam C. fluminea on the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages of the Limay River, one of the most important rivers of the arid plateau of Argentinian Patagonia. As this river is currently in the process of being invaded, it was possible to compare invaded and non-invaded sites. Invaded sites displayed a certain homogenization of their constituent species and functional composition. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, similarity analysis and similarity percentages showed negative or positive influence of the presence of this species on the abundance of some taxa, due to competition for resources in this low-productivity Patagonian ecosystem. The deposition of the faeces and pseudo-faeces of C. fluminea enriches the organic content of the sediments. However, its pedal feeding can function as a competitive strategy: by consuming its own deposited organic matter when food is scarce, the amount available to other macroinvertebrates is reduced. This paper is the first contribution on the impact of this invasion on northern Patagonia's aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages.

Various types of dyes were used for dyeing wool, but metal-complex dyes are the most favoured because of their high affinity towards protein fibres. The main purpose of this study was to reduce the concentration of metals from wool industry wastewater by microscopic filamentous fungi of genus Aspergillus. The most significant growth of biofilm, and thus the highest ability to reduce metal content in an aqueous solution was observed by microscopic filamentous fungi Aspergillus ochraceus. After 30 days of biodegradation process, the concentration of copper was reduced by 47.94%, and of chromium by 32.55%. Aspergillus flavus reduced the concentration of chromium by 18.34%, and Aspergillus candidus by 20.71%.

TI Disentangling the Complexity of Regional Ecosystem Degradation:
   Uncovering the Interconnected Natural-Social Drivers of Quantity and
   Quality Loss
SO LAND
AB In the face of the combined effects of economic development and climate change, ecosystems are experiencing unprecedented pressures. It is imperative to diagnose changes in the quantity and quality of ecosystems, as well as identify the integrated natural and social driving mechanisms that underlie these changes, in order to facilitate ecosystem restoration and maintenance. In this study, we analyzed the changes in forest, grassland, farmland, and water ecosystems in Hubei Province, China from 2000 to 2020. We examined the changes in ecosystem quantity by assessing their area, and for evaluating ecosystem quality, we utilized an ecosystem quality index (EQI). To further understand the integrated natural-social driving mechanisms behind the degradation of different types of ecosystems, we selected four natural factors and fifteen socio-economic factors, based on the influences of climate change and human activities. We employed stepwise regression models for analysis. Our study reveals significant degradation of farmland and grassland ecosystems in Hubei Province from 2000 to 2020, reducing by 5.16% and 82.46%, respectively. The water ecosystems have slightly decreased by 1.08%, while and the forest ecosystems has increased by 2.64%. The analysis further highlights that the total area of ecosystem quality degradation in Hubei Province reached 5.34%. Additionally, our findings indicate that human activities have a greater impact on the quantitative degradation of ecosystems, while climate change has a greater impact on the quality degradation of ecosystems. Specifically, the forestry output value has a significant negative impact on the area of farmland and grassland ecosystems, while rural per capita net income and fishery output value have a significant negative impact on water area. Annual precipitation and annual average temperature have a significant positive effect on the quality of ecosystems in the good-quality level, while ecosystems in the low-quality level are mainly influenced by annual evaporation. Our results provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to restore and manage ecosystems effectively in order to promote regional sustainable development.

TI Biomarkers employment in planktonic copepods for early management and
   conservation of aquatic ecosystems: The case of the 'Capo Peloro' lakes
   (southern Italy)
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Transitional water ecosystems can be exposed to high levels of anthropic pressure. The main aim of this study was to present the 'Capo Peloro' lakes (southern Italy) case study, which highlights the advantageous use of ecotoxicological biomarkers in key copepod species, to reveal potential contamination in transitional water ecosystems. The focus was on changes that occur after the summer season, as during the summer, the surrounding human population increases significantly, with the consequent enhancement of anthropic pressures. Biomarkers were defined to monitor the zooplankton copepods Paracartia latisetosa, Acartia tonsa and Oithona brevicornis. Acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, and benzo(a) pyrene-monooxygenase activities were determined. P. latisetosa, A. tonsa and O. brevicornis show linear increases in their acetylcholinesterase activities with increasing concentrations in sample homogenates, which defines their high metabolic rates, and thus the suitability of these species as bioindicators. Biochemical alterations in these species induce changes in their biological attributes that can also lead to their disappearance, with a cascade of consequences for the higher trophic levels in the food chain. These data indicate that for the two lakes of Capo Peloro there is contamination by pesticides, carbamates and polycyclic and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. This occurs mainly at the end of the summer season, and only affects the species of the low trophic levels. This case study shows the benefits provided by this biomarker approach as applied to zooplankton species, to monitor transitional water ecosystems and to estimate their toxicological risk, and thus to provide an early warning signal for loss of ecosystem integrity.

TI Tracking the influence of antibiotics, antibiotic resistomes, and
   salinity gradient in modulating microbial community assemblage of
   surface water and the ecological consequences
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The ecological impacts of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on water ecology remain elusive in natural environments. We investigated the influence of antibiotics, ARGs and salinity gradient on the surface water ecosystem. Cefquinome (104.2 +/- 43.6 ng/L) and cefminox (16.2 +/- 7.50 ng/L) cephalosporins were predominant in all sites. Antibiotic contamination was increased in the estuary ecosystems compared to the freshwater ecosystems by 6%. Bacterial diversity could resist changes in salinity, but the relative abundance of some bacterial genera; Pseudoalteromonas, Glaciecola, norank_f_Arcobacteraceae, and Pseudohongiella was increased in the estuary zone (salinity>0.2%). The eukaryotic composition was increased in the subsaline environments (<0.2%), but the higher salinity in the saline zone inhibited the eukaryotic diversity. The relative abundance of ARGs was significantly higher in the estuary than in freshwater ecosystems, and ARGs interactions and mobile elements (aac(6')-Ib(aka_aacA4)-01, tetR-02, aacC, intI1, intI-1(clinic), qacEdelta1-01, and strB) were the predominant factors responsible for the ARGs propagation. Antibiotics associated with corresponding and non-corresponding ARGs and potentially created an adverse environment that increased the predation and pathogenicity of the aquatic food web and inhibited the metabolic functions. Surface water are first-line-ecosystems receiving antibiotics and ARGs hence our findings provided vital insights into understanding their ecological consequences on surface water ecosystems.

TI Engaging with Industry to Spur Blue Growth
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Improving marine resource management and governance requires marrying science and socio-economics, which is key to the development of the Blue Economy. For sustainable growth of the Blue Economy (Blue Growth) to occur, there needs to be robust scientific information on the marine environment, detailed knowledge of activities occurring within ocean space, and comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts. To ensure Blue Growth is sustainable into the future, information is also needed on how the marine environment, activities and impacts may change with time, and at relevant spatial scales. ATLAS, a transAtlantic assessment and deep-water ecosystem-based EU H2020 Project, has undertaken pioneering research to understand the environmental status of the North Atlantic deep sea, and the interaction between Blue Growth scenarios and the marine environment. ATLAS research into North Atlantic Ocean circulation, species and habitat connectivity shows that the North Atlantic is changing, which will impact Blue Growth. As marine industries move progressively offshore, ATLAS work on defining elements of Good Environmental Status for deep-water ecosystems will improve the understanding of Blue Growth interactions with the deep-sea. Potential trade-offs to maintain ecosystem services at a sea-basin scale have also been explored through a selection of 12 ATLAS case studies. ATLAS interactions with industry have highlighted opportunities and challenges for Blue Economy sectors, particularly in the context of marine spatial planning. Through interviews, questionnaires and workshops, ATLAS has discussed key scientific findings and Blue Growth scenarios with 10 major Blue Economy sectors and many supporting sectors. This work illustrates the complexities of Blue Growth in the North Atlantic, including spatial needs, synergies and conflicts, and data sharing opportunities. ATLAS-industry dialogue also highlights differences in Blue Economy sectoral expectations, and levels of understanding relating to new policy instruments.

TI Heavy metal contamination of the Loucka river water ecosystem
SO ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO
AB Heavy metal contamination of the Loucka River water ecosystem was assessed in July 2005. We analyzed concentrations of T-Hg (total mercury), Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni in water, sediments, zoobenthos, and in the brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario) muscle and liver tissues (a total of 28 individuals) at four sampling sites. The highest Pb and Ni concentrations (4.634 - 12.050 and 0.689 - 24.980 mg.kg(-1)) were found in sediments. The zoobenthos was most contaminated by Zn and Cu (0.556 - 1.505 and 2.925 - 74.300 mg.kg(-1)). The heavy metal contamination of river water was highest in Ni and Cr (0.1 - 6.8 and 0.5 - 10.0 mg.1(-1)). Concentrations of heavy metals in the brown trout muscle were following (in mg.kg(-1)): Pb 0.108 +/- 0.073 - 1.010 +/- 0.506, Cd 0.003 +/- 0.002 - 0.026 +/- 0.022, Zn 3.956 +/- 0.371 - 5.801 +/- 1.718, Ni 0.058 +/- 0.018 - 0.102 +/- 0.046, Cr 0.028 +/- 0.005 - 0.073 +/- 0.039, Cu 0.329 +/- 0.079 - 0.437 +/- 0.064 and Hg 0.065 +/- 0.008 - 0.106 +/- 0.047. Statistical differences (P < 0.05) in the brown trout muscle were in Pb and Zn. Cd, Cu and Zn were markedly accumulated in the brown trout liver (concentrations 0.107 +/- 0.066 - 0.223 +/- 0.078, 59.973 +/- 38.951 - 145.800 +/- 48.286 and 30.671 +/- 3.574 - 34.274 +/- 7.226 mg.kg(-1)). Humans of 60 kg body mass may consume 1.5 kg of brown trout muscle from the Loucka River weekly without any risk. Adverse influence of the Uniglas distillery on the Loucka River environment contamination by heavy metals was not confirmed.

TI Impacts of alternative land-use policies on water ecosystem services in
   the Rio Grande de Comitan-Lagos de Montebello watershed, Mexico
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Land-cover degradation affects the ability of forests to provide water ecosystem services (ESw). This study explores the forest-water nexus and provides an overview of the water management related to potential hy-drological impacts of land-use and land-cover change in the Rio Grande de Comitan-Lagos de Montebello watershed in southeastern Mexico. A combination of methods recommended by the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA), as well as scenario modelling based on an ecological index of riparian quality, were used to assess how alternative reforestation or deforestation scenarios can affect water provision and water quality at different scales. The results indicate that water quality is positively related to forest cover. The effects of terrain and forest-cover conditions on fog inputs and actual evapotranspiration were relevant to increase the water yield under reforestation scenarios. However, strategies for improving the efficient consumption of both green and blue water resources must be considered at a local scale. Deteriorated ESw are also related to inadequate management of water resources in the study area, so water security for local populations requires land use policies that should consider forest-based solutions, sustainable agricultural practices, and the development of efficient distribution networks for water.

TI Predicting River Macroinvertebrate Communities Distributional Shifts
   under Future Global Change Scenarios in the Spanish Mediterranean Area
SO PLOS ONE
AB Several studies on global change over the next century predict increases in mean air tem-peratures of between 1 degrees C to 5 degrees C that would affect not only water temperature but also river flow. Climate is the predominant environmental driver of thermal and flow regimes of fresh-water ecosystems, determining survival, growth, metabolism, phenology and behaviour as well as biotic interactions of aquatic fauna. Thus, these changes would also have consequences for species phenology, their distribution range, and the composition and dynamics of communities. These effects are expected to be especially severe in the Mediterranean basin due its particular climate conditions, seriously threatening Southern European ecosys-tems. In addition, species with restricted distributions and narrow ecological requirements, such as those living in the headwaters of rivers, will be severely affected. The study area corresponds to the Spanish Mediterranean and Balearic Islands, delimited by the Koppen climate boundary. With the application of the MEDPACS (MEDiterranean Pre-diction And Classification System) predictive approach, the macroinvertebrate community was pre-dicted for current conditions and compared with three posible scenarios of watertempera-ture increase and its associated water flow reductions. The results indicate that the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities will undergo a drastic impact, with reductions in taxa richness for each scenario in relation to simulated current conditions, accompanied by changes in the taxa distribution pattern. Accordingly, the distribution area of most of the taxa (65.96%) inhabiting the mid-high elevations would contract and rise in altitude. Thus, fami-lies containing a great number of generalist species will move upstream to colonize new zones with lower water temperatures. By contrast, more vulnerable taxa will undergo reduc-tions in their distribution area.

TI It's a Long Way to the Tap: Microbiome and DNA-Based Omics at the Core
   of Drinking Water Quality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Microbial communities interact with us and affect our health in ways that are only beginning to be understood. Microorganisms have been detected in every ecosystem on Earth, as well as in any built environment that has been investigated. Drinking water sources, drinking water treatment plants and distribution systems provide peculiar microbial ecological niches, dismantling the belief of the "biological simplicity" of drinking water. Nevertheless, drinking water microbiomes are understudied compared to other microbiomes. Recent DNA sequencing and meta-omics advancements allow a deeper understanding of drinking water microbiota. Thus, moving beyond the limits of day-to-day testing for specific pathogenic microbes, new approaches aim at predicting microbiome changes driven by disturbances at the macro-scale and overtime. This will foster an effective and proactive management of water sources, improving the drinking water supply system and the monitoring activities to lower public health risk. Here, we want to give a new angle on drinking water microbiome research. Starting from a selection of 231 scientific publications on this topic, we emphasize the value of biodiversity in drinking water ecosystems and how it can be related with industrialization. We then discuss how microbiome research can support sustainable drinking water management, encouraging collaborations across sectors and involving the society through responsible research and innovation.

TI Grand Challenges in the Management and Conservation of North American
   Inland Fishes and Fisheries
SO FISHERIES
AB Even with long-standing management and extensive science support, North American inland fish and fisheries still face many conservation and management challenges. We used a grand challenges approach to identify critical roadblocks that if removed would help solve important problems in the management and long-term conservation of North American inland fish and fisheries. We identified seven grand challenges within three themes (valuation, governance, and externalities) and 34 research needs and management actions. The major themes identified are to (1) raise awareness of diverse values associated with inland fish and fisheries, (2) govern inland fish and fisheries to satisfy multiple use and conservation objectives, and (3) ensure productive inland fisheries given nonfishing sector externalities. Addressing these grand challenges will help the broader community understand the diverse values of inland fish and fisheries, promote open forums for engagement of diverse stakeholders in fisheries management, and better integrate the inland fish sector into the greater water and land use policy process.

AB Human activities, including industrial and aquaculture, may have impact on water environment, especially organic enrichment. One of bioindicator of pollution that affect the quality of the water ecosystem is macrobenthic community. In general, the more diverse macrobenthic assemblages indicate the better of the waters quality. Understanding spatial and temporal distribution of macrobenthic abundance has become an important part of research in the field of ecology in understanding the level of environmental disturbance over time. This study discussed the application of the method of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to asses seasonal variability of macrobentic assemblages. We found that forecasting using autoregressive integrated moving average method with the model of ARIMA (0,1,1) is obtained the smallest value of the Mean Square Deviation (MSD).

TI Addressing Coldwater Temperature Impairment in a Changing Climate
SO FISHERIES
AB Climate change is concerning for fisheries professionals because increased water temperatures threaten coldwater habitats, which are vital to recreational and commercial fisheries and keystone species. The Clean Water Act provides a legal framework to identify and address water quality impairments including those associated with temperature. Although this framework provides a basic strategy to identify impairments, develop total maximum daily loads, and reduce pollution, it does not explicitly consider the challenges of a changing climate in addressing water quality impairments. Clean Water Act administrators and fisheries professionals can facilitate temperature restoration planning and implementation using the Clean Water Act framework to link stakeholders to the management of coldwater resources. Stakeholder engagement and collaboration, robust local monitoring, and incorporating climate resilience into restoration planning and implementation will promote comprehensive management of temperature impairments and the effects of climate change on fisheries.

AB This paper presents a complex dynamical model to give the evaluation and prediction to water scarcity, which contains four subsystems: population subsystem, agricultural subsystem, industrial subsystem and environment subsystem, that are coupled each other and affected by the inner parameters. Then, the supply water coming from environment subsystem, and the demand water depending on the other three subsystems are evaluated and predicted by Vensim. Correspondingly, we choose the water deficit calculated from the difference between the quantities of supply and demand water to measure the ability of a region to provide clean water. Focusing on the region of the South Africa, where the water is moderately overloaded, we employ the dynamical water ecosystem model to evaluate and predict the water scarcity. It is obtained that there are three main factors that influence water deficit: rainfall, recycle sewage and water demand per capita by parametric sensitivity analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the year, at which the quantity of supply water can't meet the demand, is delayed by changing the three factors in a positive direction. We expect our work to provide insight into the challenging problem of harnessing the global water scarcity problem.

TI Salinity as a Key Factor in Structuring Macrophyte Assemblages in
   Transitional Water Bodies: The Case of the Apulian Coastal Lagoons
   (Southern Italy)
SO DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB Coastal lagoons are dynamic transitional water ecosystems hosting valuable biological communities, including rich and diverse macrophyte assemblages. Aquatic macrophytes must cope with large fluctuations of environmental conditions on a spatial and seasonal scale. Salinity is one of the most variable parameters, changing from nearly freshwater to hypersalinity, and it is known to have a strong influence on the composition and structure of macrophyte assemblages. This study is focused on the effect of salinity on macrophyte communities of the eight most important coastal lagoons of Apulia (south-eastern Mediterranean Sea). A set of eleven transitional water body types (sensu Water Framework Directive) were allocated in a range of meso- to hyperhaline lagoons. Macrophyte sampling was carried out between 2011 and 2019, and a total of 324 samples (18 sampling stations x 2 seasons x 9 years) was analyzed. Then, macrophyte occurrence in each transitional water body (T-WB) was expressed as frequency values (%) and assemblages were compared to assess any similarity in relation to four salinity classes (mesohaline, polyhaline, euhaline and hyperhaline). Species richness varied according to the salinity class, being much higher in polyhaline and euhaline T-WBs and strongly decreasing at the extremes of the salinity range (mesohaline and hyperhaline T-WBs). Moreover, the statistical analysis showed a high resemblance of macrophyte assemblages of T-WBs within the same salinity class, which shared a great number of species. Four distinct macrophyte communities were distinguished, reflecting the salinity conditions of different T-WB types and confirming the effectiveness of a lagoon typology based on this descriptor.

   changes in physicochemical conditions of the water ecosystem
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB In this paper, we consider the development of reliable tools to assess the water quality and state of aquatic ecosystems in dynamic conditions a crucial need to address. One of such tools could be devised by monitoring the taxonomic structure of reservoirs' microbiomes. Microbial taxa's ecological and metabolic characteristics suggest their essential roles in maintaining the water ecosystem's environmental equilibrium. The study aimed to explain the role of diversity and seasonal variability of the microbial communities in the ecosystem stability on the example of Goczalkowice Reservoir (Poland). The structure of the reservoir microbiome was studied using bioinformatics and modeling techniques. Water was sampled periodically in July & November 2010, and April 2011 at four representative sites. The abundance and relative fraction of the limnetic taxonomic units were determined in respect to the physicochemical indices. Significant seasonal variations in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) were observed within the reservoir basin's main body but not at the main tributary's mouth. The highest values of the correlation coefficients between OTU and physicochemical variables were obtained for Burkholderiales, Pseudoanabenales, Rickettsiales, Roseiflexales, Methylophilales, Actinomycetales, and Cryptophyta. These microorganisms are proposed as indicators of environmental conditions and water quality. Metataxonomic analyses of the freshwater microbiome in the reservoir, showed that microorganisms constitute conservative communities that undergo seasonal and local changes regarding the relative participation of the identified taxa. Therefore, we propose that monitoring those variations could provide a reliable measure of the state of aquatic ecosystems.

TI Saturation indices of aqueous mineral phases as proxies of seasonal
   dynamics of a transitional water ecosystem using a geochemical modeling
   approach
SO MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The geochemistry and saturation indices (SI) of carbonate and non-carbonate mineral phases under standard thermodynamic conditions in an aqueous environment are largely influenced by the dynamic physico-chemical parameters. Based on the known feedback mechanisms of environmental parameters on the rates of mineralisation, the changes in environmental parameters such as pH, dissolved ionic concentrations and salinity were modelled as a function of their spatial and temporal distributions (dry and wet seasons) in a transitional aquatic ecosystem in South India, Pulicat lagoon. The investigation revealed the strong seasonal influence of these parameters on the magnitude and values of the SIs signalling dissolution or mineralisation. Hydroxyapatite and Talc were found to have higher positive SIs. Co-precipitation of calcite and aragonite were evident and found to be constrained by high salinities. Among the carbonates, dolomites and magnesium-calcites showed high SIs compared to calcite and aragonite, indicating that magnesium ions were incorporated into the mineral phases possibly due to the availability of nucleation sites through heterotrophic reactions. The formation of apatite was strongly influenced by pH changes, corresponding to low calcite precipitation in the wet season. High SI of hydroxyapatite, talc and silicate minerals indicate the low bioavailability of dissolved phosphate and silicates in the water during both the seasons. Strong evidences of seasonal control of pH, salinity and Total Dissolved Solids on the dissolution and mineralisation characteristics further influence nutrient bioavailability over varied spatio-temporal scales. The present study supports the potential application of the saturation indices as proxies to understand the complex biogeochemical dynamics of transitional water ecosystems.

TI Assessing eutrophication in transitional waters: A performance analysis

SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
CT 7th European Coastal Lagoons Symposium
CY MAR 01-04, 2016
CL Murcia, SPAIN
SP Univ Murcia, Campus Mare Nostrum, Fundac Seneca, Reg Murcia
AB The Transitional Water Quality Index (TWQI) is a simple tool for assessing the trophic status in shallow transitional water ecosystems, that can be easily implemented from basic monitoring activities. It integrates six metrics: the main causal factors of eutrophication (N and P concentrations), key biological elements (phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, benthic phanerogams and macroalgal cover) and an indicator of the eutrophication effects (dissolved oxygen saturation). This paper investigates the effectiveness of the TWQI to increase the confidence in trophic status assessment and to reduce the uncertainty due to temporal variability. The temporal variability of TWQI and its six single metrics, individually considered, were investigated in Venice Lagoon using data from 29 stations, sampled in July and October 2010, and 8 stations sampled monthly from April 2014 to March 2015. TWQI resulted less affected by seasonal fluctuations than the individual metrics, generally reducing the mean temporal variability by at least 50%. The influence of monitoring frequency on the uncertainty of the trophic status assessment was investigated as percent error of the TWQI annual mean. Means were firstly obtained from 12-monthly samplings. Lower sampling frequencies were also simulated and the deviation from the annual mean derived by monthly sampling was estimated. Overall, the annual mean values of TWQJ was much less affected by the sampling frequency than individual indicators (e.g. Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen). Based on the performance analysis of this study that demonstrates its reliability and efficiency, the TWQI can be recommended as a routine index to be used in large-scale monitoring of the trophic status in shallow transitional water ecosystems.

TI Impact of climate change on land, water and ecosystem quality in polar
   and mountainous regions: gaps in our knowledge
SO CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB Nowhere are the effects of climate change more visible than in polar and mountainous regions. To initiate the Interregional Technical Co-operation Project INT/5/153 (2014-2018) on Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Land-Water-Ecosystem Quality in Polar and Mountainous Regions (funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency and supported by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture), we built a database containing 769 of the most significant journal papers on the effects of climate change in polar and mountainous regions between 2000 and 2014 (up until the Fifth IPCC Assessment). Using the number of paper citations per year (CPY), we derive the top 50 most cited journal papers published in the 15 yr period. Analysis of the focus of these 'top 50' papers is compared to the IPCC Fifth Assessment (AR5) Report (IPCC 2013) and the full database. Five categories emerged, and after combining the number of papers in each category with the average CPY for the category, research on the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems (E) in polar and mountainous regions dominated, research on the impact on water resources (W) was second, and the impact on people's livelihood (P) third, with ice and snow (I) fourth and landscape (L) fifth. Landscape (L), in our view, appears to be under-researched and is presumably included in the IPCC Terrestrial Ecosystems category. We propose that policy makers should note this under-representation of high-impact research into landscape processes (erosion and deposition processes), which needs to be addressed in future.

SO BIOLOGIA
AB The leaf litter of the black poplar (Populus nigra. L.), black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.), English oak (Quercus robur L.) and white willow (Salix alba. L.) showed differences in the rates of water absorption, leaching loss and nutrient efflux. The results obtained proved that the different rates were caused by both the distinctions in the physical and chemical structure of the leaf litter and the ratio of stable and unstable fractions of organic matter. Immediately after leaf input into water, the water penetration and following leaching caused concentration increase of easily dissolved fractions of organic matter in the water ecosystem.

TI Seasonal effect of agricultural pollutants on coastline environment: a
   case study of the southern estuarine water ecosystem of the boseong
   county Korea
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB The untreated disposal of wastewater in the coastal environment leads to growth of harmful algal blooms which risks the coastal ecology and human health. The harmful algal bloom can destroy aquatic natural life by reducing dissolved oxygen concentration. This study aimed to evaluate the eutrophication status at the Boseong county, Beolgyo village estuary, considering different water quality parameters. Furthermore, this study also investigated the effect of land use activates the estuarine water environment. The date of the acquisition for the Landsat 8 high-resolution satellite images were four different events i.e., 11th March, 2019, 15th June, 2019, 19th September, 2019, and 8th December, 2019 in four different seasons such as Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter respectively for selected study region. Land use and land cover were extracted on the basis of accuracy's percentage and the Kappa coefficient. Concentrations of water quality parameters such as Chlorophyll-a (Chi-a), Total Phosphorous (TP), Transparency of Sechi Depth (TSD) were extracted using Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI). The study found that the overall value of the CTSI is classified under the medium eutrophication state in summer and autumn season (CTSI-60-70). While it falls in the light eutrophic state in winter and spring seasons (CTSI-50-60). The value of TSI for all studied nutrients is the higher nearby cropping area as well as land settlements. The spatial variation of the trophic index in the study region aided strong evidence to be detected over the area's adjutant to agrarian farming and urban habitats. The study concludes that the TSI could be used as a simple management tool to classify individual water ecosystems into broad classification that represent their water quality health.

TI HAZARD ASSESSMENT IN FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS

CT 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF TOXICOLOGY : TOXICOLOGY FROM DISCOVERY AND
   EXPERIMENTATION TO THE HUMAN PERSPECTIVE
CY JUN 28-JUL 03, 1992
CL ROME, ITALY
AB Hazard assessment of chemicals Ln freshwater environments depends on comparing concentrations that are expected to occur in water and sediment, i.e. expected environmental concentrations (EEC), with those that are estimated to have no biological effects, i.e. the no-observed effect concentrations (NOEC). The difference between these two estimates is the margin of safety. The EEC can be estimated from data for chemical release rates, physicochemical properties and environmental parameters that affect transport and transformation. The NOEC can be estimated from the results of toxicity tests using aquatic plants, invertebrates and fish. When making these estimates it may be necessary to extrapolate from relatively limited laboratory data to the real world. Inevitably, this involves some degree of uncertainty. Such uncertainty can often be resolved by carrying out controlled field tests, using small, outdoor enclosures (microcosms), relatively large, outdoor ponds (mesocosms) and experimental streams.  In this paper the advantages and disadvantages of various experimental approaches and systems will be reviewed.

The one-dimensional bio-optical model of water ecosystem dynamic is used. The aim of the investigation is to simulate few suggested factors influence, which were proposed as possible reasons lead to full extinction of diatoms during cold climates. Effects of silicon influx change, winter period duration, ice optical properties variability and glaciers-generated suspended matter impact are studied. It is shown that diatoms production is highly sensitive to optical properties of ice and suspended matter influence. The most probable reason for diatoms extinction during cold climates is glacier-generated suspended matter optical impact.

SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
AB We present the Water Ecosystems Tool (WET) - a new generation of open-source, highly customizable aquatic ecosystem model. WET is a completely modularized aquatic ecosystem model developed in the syntax of the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM), which enables coupling to multiple physical models ranging from zero to three dimensions, and is based on the FABM-PCLake model. The WET model has been extensively modularized, empowering users with flexibility of food web configurations, and incorporates model features from other state-of-the-art models, with new options for nitrogen fixation and vertical migration. With the new structure, features and flexible customization options, WET is suitable in a wide range of aquatic ecosystem applications. We demonstrate these new features and their impacts on model behavior for a temperate lake for which a model calibration of the FABM-PCLake model was previously published and discuss the benefits of the new model.

TI Bioaccumulation of potentially toxic elements in fish species of Serbia:
   a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In the first review of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in fish in water ecosystems in Serbia, 40 studies related to fish contamination with PTEs were identified and evaluated. Studies of concentrations of PTEs in fish tissues covered 28 ecosystems (108 localities). The main studied river ecosystems were the Danube and the Sava, and the Meduvrsje reservoir was the most studied standing water ecosystem. Among the most studied fish species were catfish (Silurus glanis), followed by pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), bream (Abramis brama), carp (Cyprinus carpio), and barbel (Barbus barbus). There were 48 "hot spot" sampling sites where concentrations of Hg, Cd, Pb, As, Ni, Fe, and/or Cu exceeded the maximum permitted concentrations (MPCs) prescribed by legislation. Elevated concentrations of these elements were the most detected in fish species sampled in the Danube, Sava, and rivers belonging to the Velika Morava basin. Hg concentrations were the most common above MPC in muscle tissue of species sampled from the Danube and Sava rivers. On the other hand, we can single out the species Vimba bream (Vimba vimba), sampled in Danube River in Zemun near Belgrade, as the safest species for human consumption due to the largest number of elements in fish meat below detection limits. Finally, having in mind all the criteria prescribed by U.S. EPA (2000), we identify and recommend two predatory fish species pikeperch (S. lucioperca) and catfish (S. glanis), and bottom-feeding fish species barbel (B. barbus) as bioindicators of PTEs contamination in Serbian waters.

TI Critical approach to diatom-based bioassessment of the regulated
   sections of urban flowing water ecosystems
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Hydromorphological transformations of small urban streams results in changes in habitat conditions, i. e. increase in water speed current and/or oxygen concentration, and finally changes in aquatic organism structure. The ecological status of two regulated urban streams was determined by diatom-based biomonitoring in their upper and lower sections using selected diatom indices (IO, IPS, IBD, GDI, TDI). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to analyse the structure of diatom assemblages and to reveal the spatial relationships between stream sites. The bioassessment was supported with a chemical analysis of the water. The upper sections were found to be characterised by poor/bad ecological status, and the lower sections below highly-transformed and impacted streambeds by good/moderate status. Since the bioassessment revealed unexpected results, an analysis was performed of the dominant species, with special attention paid to the autecology of diatoms. A new model of bioassessment was implemented where the most frequent and dominant species, Achnanthidium minutissimum, was excluded from the analysis. The results obtained by the new analysis were similar to those of the chemical analysis. Such a critical approach is needed to reveal the true ecological status of flowing water ecosystems, particularly in the case of regulated streams where transformation has resulted in a change in more ` pseudo-mountain' habitat conditions.

AB Asia's largest brackish water ecosystem, Chilika lagoon, supports livelihood of millions of inhabitants and also known to be bio-geo-chemically dynamic. This demands continuous monitoring of lagoon for which optical remote sensing may be crucial. The in situ bio-optical parameters were analyzed in two sectors (Outer Channel: OC and Southern Sector: SS) of Asia's largest brackish water ecosystem, Chilika lagoon. The spectral Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs) ranged from 0.003 to 0.02sr(-1) in OC whereas in SS it was between 0.003 and 0.028sr(-1). The minimum R-rs was at 400nm that gradually increased with a peak at 580nm and subsequently decreased towards longer wavelength. R-rs exhibited similar pattern in both the sectors from 400 to 600nm. Beyond this wavelength, Rrs was relatively higher in SS. The shifting of peak towards longer wavelength could be attributed to high absorption due to chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) that varied largely between sectors with relatively higher concentration of chl-a in OC and CDOM in SS. Further, we modelled chl-a by seven ocean colour algorithms (OC4, OC4E, OC4O, OC3M, OC3V, OC3C and OCMO2) using in situ Rrs. The modelled chl-a was overestimating in situ at all stations due to high concentration of CDOM contaminating chl-a signals. However in OC, in situ and modelled chl-a followed the same trend (R-2=0.88 to 0.90) probably due to strong co-variance of chl-a with CDOM. The analysis of this study points out towards the requirement for sector specific bio-optical algorithm for accurate chl-a retrieval for synoptic monitoring of lagoon health.

TI Quality targets for pesticides and other pollutants in surface waters
SO ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA
AB Surface waters are not only adversely affected by industrial and municipal wastewaters but also by diffuse sources. For the control of the ecological water quality, so-called quality targets are set. The quality targets are threshold concentrations for hazardous substances related to the protected goods like water ecosystems, drinking water supply, sediments, or fishing.
   In this paper, quality targets for the protection of aquatic life in surface waters were derived on the basis of a concept developed by the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (Internationale Kommission zum Schutze des Rheins - IKSR). The quality targets for the selected hazardous substances, which mainly belong to the chemical class of pesticides, were calculated using ecotoxicological results for species of bacteria, algae, fish, and small crustaceans, as the four trophic standards of the water ecosystem. In cooperation with the Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt - UBA) the effect data were taken from ecotoxicological data bases. According to the concept of the IKSR, the lowest test result for the most sensitive species was multiplied by an assessment factor. This proceeding concerns the difficulty in describing the complex interactions in water ecosystems with toxicity data of single laboratory experiments for a few organisms.
   For seven pesticides quality targets below 0.1 mug/L were proposed. These results show that the ecotoxicologically based quality targets might be even lower than the limit values for pesticides in drinking water of 0.1 mug/L. But for most of the substances the determined values are significantly higher. The great concentration range of quality targets demonstrates distinctly that one standard concentration for all pesticides could not be given with regard to the different effects on aquatic organisms.
   Incomplete data sets do not allow the derivation of quality targets for desethyl- and desisopropylatrazine, both decomposition products of atrazine. First of all, further toxicological tests have to be carried out. For the complete assessment of some compounds with a high accumulation potential, sediments and suspended materials as well as the targets for professional fishing and sport fishing have to be considered besides the aquatic communities.
   Most of the presented quality targets are preliminary results which have to be finally verified by the German Lander Working Party on Water (Landerarbeitsgemeinschaft Wasser - LAWA) and by the IKSR. Up to now the results for nine of the pesticides have already been accepted by the IKSR. A comparison with the current water quality data is important in order to show whether the quality targets will be exceeded by the actual concentrations, Then it has to be decided which efforts for water protection are necessary in addition to the direct pollution control according to the existing legal regulations.

TI Diversity of cyanobacteria and microalgae in hydro-terrestrial habitats
   in Svalbard and its ecological evaluation
SO POLISH POLAR RESEARCH
AB The aim of this research was to study the biodiversity of cyanobacteria and microalgae in hydro-terrestrial habitats from the area of Hornsund fjord (Svalbard archipelago). This research is particularly important, because hitherto no complex research (including all taxonomic groups) has previously been conducted on the cyanobacterial and microalgal flora in Arctic water ecosystems. The research was conducted during the summer seasons of 2011 and 2013. Shannon's diversity index was used to describe species diversity and evenness. Data on cyanobacteria and microalgae were analyzed using the MVSP and PCA. Additionally, a basic analysis of the physicochemical properties of water in the studied ecosystems was performed. A total of 506 taxa were noted in the studied hydro-terrestrial habitats. The most numerous group was cyanobacteria, constituting 35% of all recorded taxa. Ochrophyta and Chiorphyta were almost equally numerous (percentage again as for cyanobacteria). Nineteen types of assemblages were noted in all studied hydro-terrestrial habitats. The diversity of cyanobacteria and microalgae and the assemblages formed by them were used to determine the characteristics of the studied ecosystems. Each type of water ecosystem was represented by specific phycoflora and assemblages. Ecological parameters along with biological data (the diversity of cyanotracteria and microalgae) allowed us to sort the studied hydro-terrestrial habitats by similarity. Our analyses clearly distinguished water ecosystem groups differing in species composition determining their trophic status. The research shows the usefulness of cyanobacteria and microalgae diversity defined by the Shannon-Weaver index for characterizing bodies of water and determining the trophic status of these habitats.

TI Water Values: Participatory Water Ecosystem Services Assessment in the
   Arno River Basin, Italy
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Water-related Ecosystem Services (WES), namely the multiple benefits that humans can obtain from water or water-related functions of an ecosystem, constitute a useful perspective to look at the overlap between biosphere and anthroposphere and to explore their sustainable coupling. On one hand, society acts as a driver of landscapes transformation, influencing the ecohydrological processes that underpin a large set of potential WES. On the other hand, society is the recipient of the WES provided by ecosystems, determining the actual production of services. Aiming at exploring the ecosystem-water-society nexus, this study develops a 4-tiered methodology for the participatory evaluation of WES as a basis to facilitate a shared watershed planning process in the Arno river basin (Central Italy), carried out within the framework of the Tuscany Regional Law for participation. Starting from the biophysical assessment of the study area and the analysis of the population, multiple focus groups were organized to allow the participatory evaluation of WES, mainly targeting low impact stakeholders. The proposed approach allowed the WES mapping and the identification of valuable WES characterised by a critical status. These results served as the basis for the analysis of multiple scenarios and the co-definition of a shared management strategy, jointly with decision makers. The analysis highlights the potential of WES concept as a suitable common language for developing participatory processes that support integrated water resources management. The proposed participatory WES assessment approach can sustain the active involvement of all interested parties in Water Framework Directive implementation (Art.14) and foster a wider policy objective of sustainability through the management plans.

TI Towards clarifying the presence of alien algae in inland waters - can we
   predict places of their occurrence?
SO BIOLOGIA
AB Small algae are the trophic basis in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. The identification of tiny microorganisms and place of their origin is laborious but necessary. This paper consists of a literature review of 17 species of planktonic algae, with a discussion of taxonomic problems. We also clarify whether these 17 species are non-native, invasive or cryptogenic species, with an indication whether they had been recognised as 'alien' in Europe. According to our observations, areas colonized by small and alien algal species, were anthropogenically altered. There were: systems with heated waters ('heated islands'), which imitated tropical conditions; highly eutrophic to hypereutrophic water ecosystems, easily colonized by alien species, fishponds with intense fish cultivation, where alien species of fish are/ had been introduced, which carried also other alien organisms; and inland water ecosystems with high salinity or high conductivity e.g. pits inundated by mine waters, imitating sea or brackish conditions acting as hubs of migration of alien species adapted to brackish or saline waters. We have prepared a map showing areas inhabited by alien species, both of documented places and hypothetical ones, where we would expect alien species to occur.

TI Relationship between mangrove forest and fish and prawn productivity
SO FISHERIES SCIENCE
AB This study aims to clarify influence of mangrove coverage on fish and prawn productivity. Four estuaries in mangrove forests under different exploited stages were selected as research sites In west coast of Peninsular Malaysia: Selinsing and Sangga Rivers in Matang, Merbok River in Kedah, and Dinding River in Lumut. The ratios of the mangrove forest area to river area were 4.7 in Matang, 3.2 in Merbok and 1.0 in Lumut. Different values of water parameters suggest that the brackish water zone was most distinct in the Selinsing, followed by Sangga, Merbok and Dinding. Differences of catch composition in terms of fish species and abundance among the four brackish water mangrove ecosystems may be strongly affected by differences in water parameters, especially influenced by the seawater with higher salinity and lower turbidity.

TI The Design of the Payments for Water-Related Ecosystem Services: What
   Should the Ideal Payment in Slovakia Look Like?
SO WATER
AB Water-related forest ecosystems services (WES) are vital to the functioning of the biosphere, society, and human well-being. In Slovakia, the active support of WES is provided by economic instruments of forest policy, while the market-based solution as payments for water-related services (PWS) is lacking. Starting from this point, the objective matter of the paper is to develop the payments for WES schemes in Slovakia. The study was based on document analysis and stakeholders ' opinions towards PWS. Fifteen Slovak stakeholders from forestry, water management, and nature protection were involved in the study. These stakeholders represent potential buyers, seller, intermediaries, and knowledge providers in PWS schemes. Based on the theoretical background and the results of the survey, the authors defined key aspects of the design and implementation of PWS schemes in Slovak conditions such as potential buyers and sellers, important factors for the implementation of PWS schemes, and the role of public authorities.

AB Nature as an intact, balanced entity is currently an unknown term in the world, save for minor exceptions. The nineteenth and twentieth century significantly changed its appearance. In the first decade of the 21(st) century in the majority of countries the situation is not improving, on the contrary it is getting much worse. The situation is partly different in the EU 27 countries, including the Czech Republic. It is not good, but there are some trends and already the first results imply that the situation is getting better in many respects. Some of the greatest progress so far has been reached in the sphere of protection of water and water ecosystems, as their inseparable part. Water and air protection is one of the most important tasks of governments and parliaments of all developed countries with a sufficient economic potential. Quality life is not possible without good atmosphere or quality surface, ground or drinking water. Therefore, the paper deals with water ecosystem protection, in particular with protection of surface and ground water. It summarizes what nature conservation measures have already been taken from the point of view of legislation and what is recommended for the years ahead.

TI Deconstructing Ecosystem Service Conflicts through the Prisms of
   Political Ecology and Game Theory in a North-Western Mediterranean River
   Basin
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB Power relationships, access and control, (in)equity, and (in)justice are key modulators of conflicts arising from ecosystem services between multiple stakeholders. A greater knowledge of stakeholder value systems and behaviors is crucial for understanding socioecological dynamics. We propose an analytical framework that combines political ecology and game theory to analyze water ecosystem services. This integrated framework was used to reinterpret concepts such as common goods, (a)symmetric flows, and (un)fair trade-offs in the context of ecosystem services. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of behaviors and (a)symmetries in power relationships between multiple stakeholders. We studied the case of a north-western Mediterranean river basin using data obtained from stakeholder interviews and newspaper articles. Our findings uncovered different types of stakeholder relationships, ranging from mutual support and cooperation to conflict. The proposed analytical framework shows how social mechanisms can affect ecosystem services flows, potentially facilitating or hindering the development of more equitable management models for natural resources.

TI Salinity tolerances and use of saline environments by freshwater
   turtles: implications of sea level rise
SO BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB The projected rise in global mean sea levels places many freshwater turtle species at risk of saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats. Freshwater turtles are disproportionately more threatened than other taxa; thus, understanding the role of salinity in determining their contemporary distribution and evolution should be a research priority. Freshwater turtles are a slowly evolving lineage; however, they can adapt physiologically or behaviourally to various levels of salinity and, therefore, temporarily occur in marine or brackish environments. Here, we provide the first comprehensive global review on freshwater turtle use and tolerance of brackish water ecosystems. We link together current knowledge of geographic occurrence, salinity tolerance, phylogenetic relationships, and physiological and behavioural mechanisms to generate a baseline understanding of the response of freshwater turtles to changing saline environments. We also review the potential origins of salinity tolerance in freshwater turtles. Finally, we integrate 2100 sea level rise (SLR) projections, species distribution maps, literature gathered on brackish water use, and a phylogeny to predict the exposure of freshwater turtles to projected SLR globally. From our synthesis of published literature and available data, we build a framework for spatial and phylogenetic conservation prioritization of coastal freshwater turtles. Based on our literature review, 70 species (similar to 30% of coastal freshwater turtle species) from 10 of the 11 freshwater turtle families have been reported in brackish water ecosystems. Most anecdotal records, observations, and descriptions do not imply long-term salinity tolerance among freshwater turtles. Rather, experiments show that some species exhibit potential for adaptation and plasticity in physiological, behavioural, and life-history traits that enable them to endure varying periods (e.g. days or months) and levels of saltwater exposure. Species that specialize on brackish water habitats are likely to be vulnerable to SLR because of their exclusive coastal distributions and adaptations to a narrow range of salinities. Most species, however, have not been documented in brackish water habitats but may also be highly vulnerable to projected SLR. Our analysis suggests that approximately 90% of coastal freshwater turtle species assessed in our study will be affected by a 1-m increase in global mean SLR by 2100. Most at risk are freshwater turtles found in New Guinea, Southeast Asia, Australia, and North and South America that may lose more than 10% of their present geographic range. In addition, turtle species in the families Chelidae, Emydidae, and Trionychidae may experience the greatest exposure to projected SLR in their present geographic ranges. Better understanding of survival, growth, reproductive and population-level responses to SLR will improve region-specific population viability predictions of freshwater turtles that are increasingly exposed to SLR. Integrating phylogenetic, physiological, and spatial frameworks to assess the effects of projected SLR may improve identification of vulnerable species, guilds, and geographic regions in need of conservation prioritization. We conclude that the use of brackish and marine environments by freshwater turtles provides clues about the evolutionary processes that have prolonged their existence, shaped their unique coastal distributions, and may prove useful in predicting their response to a changing world.

TI Effects of wattle extract on Microcystic aeruginosa growth and the
   simulated mini fresh water ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB In recent years, there has been an apparent increase in the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in fresh waters. The value of applying the novel wattle extract (Acacia mimosa) to inhibit algal growth was assessed. Our results showed that the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa was successfully repressed by the plant extract and resulted in decreased extracellular microcystin-LR production. In the experiments, it showed a very effective inhibition in the stage of exponential growth (the largest decrease in level is 47.3% of the control) especially in nonsterile conditions, and the extract can reduce 14.5-24.7% cell density of the control in the stationary stage. In outdoor experiments, the extract reduced dissolved oxygen and pH, and selectively cut down cyanobacterial cell density to one-third of the control after 36 d of treatment. Accordingly due to competitive inhibition in interspecies, other nanoalgae and small-sized aquatic animals declined, while macrozooplankton increased. Finally more large algae were eliminated and thereby the water treated was clarified and the recovery of the freshwater ecosystem was promoted. Hence, the present study suggested a new and more effective and very low ecological risk approach to reduce nuisance blooms cyanobacteria in eutrophic water

SO JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of mangrove leaves, particulate organic matter (POM), shrimps and crabs, squids and fishes were studied for tracing the actual food web structure in the Matang mangrove brackish water ecosystems. Carbon isotope ratio of POM showed a positive correlation with the level of salinity, suggesting that POM around the mouth to mudflat areas of the river may consist of phytoplankton-derived detritus from the sea, whereas POM from mid- to upstream areas of the river may consist of mangrove-derived detritus. delta C-13-delta N-15 map showed a C -N isotope ratio gradient with the lowest value with mean (+/- SD) of delta C-13 (-28.74+/-0.031 parts per thousand) and delta N-15 4.36+/-0.15 parts per thousand) for a mangrove leaf (Rhizophora apiculata), the highest value of delta C-13 (-20.45+/-0.026 parts per thousand) for a squid (Loligo duvaucelii) and of delta N-15 (13.63+/-0.021 parts per thousand) for a fish (Stolephorus commersonii). Penaeid shrimps (Penaeus merguiensis, Metapenaeus brevicornis and M. ensis) and mangrove crabs (Scylla serrata) showed intermediate C-N values between those of mangrove leaves and fish/squid.

TI Putative arthropod trace fossils from the Orcadian Basin at Achanarras
   Quarry (Middle Devonian of Scotland)
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB Achanarras Quarry, Caithness, Scotland displays a diverse fossil fish fauna that is presumed to have inhabited shallow-lacustrine environments present in the Orcadian Basin during the Early to Middle Devonian. Although Achanarras Quarry itself exposes deep-lacustrine facies, the ecology of their depositional environment remains unknown, in stark contrast to the detailed environmental reconstructions available for the lake margin. I report putative arthropod trace fossils from Achanarras Quarry that are tentatively interpreted as having been formed in a deep-lake environment. Transport of doomed pioneers from the thriving shallow-water ecosystems by turbidite flows is discussed as a possible scenario for their formation. The infrequent and ephemeral intrusions of animals into the deep waters of Lake Orcadie fit the broader narrative of the colonization of deep-lake ecosystems after the Devonian. These interpretations of deep-lacustrine trace fossils from Achanarras, along with their place within the narrative of lake ecosystem evolution, are made cautiously, however, given the paucity of the specimens and the uncertainty surrounding their sedimentary setting.

TI Microplastic ingestion by fish: Body size, condition factor and gut
   fullness are not related to the amount of plastics consumed
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB This study investigates the frequency of microplastic (MP) ingestion and the relationship between microplastics in the guts of two commercial fish species in Iceland (cod; Gadus morhua and saithe; Pollachius virens) and the weight, length, gut fullness, and condition index (CI) of the fish. MPs were found in 20.5% of the cod (n = 39) and 17.4% of the saithe (n = 46). There was no significant correlation between gut fullness nor CI and findings of MPs, indicating that, especially in large individuals, MPs are not retained to a large extent, and if so, the CI is most likely not affected. A difference was found in fish length between fish containing plastic and fish without plastics. Further studies such as this must be conducted in all water ecosystems if we are to fully understand the impact that MP's are having at the individual, population, species, and ecosystem levels.

TI Tracking the Temporal Dynamics of Intracellular Lead Speciation in a
   Green Alga
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Organisms have developed metal regulatory mechanisms in response to changes in the bioavailability of trace metals. Just as metal bioavailability dictates cellular uptake, intracellular metal speciation determines the availability of metals to exert biological effects. However, the missing link in understanding the relationship between metal uptake and biological responses is the ability to accurately measure intracellular metal speciation. We conducted Pb exposure studies on the well-characterized model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and identified temporal changes in intracellular Pb speciation under conditions relevant for fresh water ecosystems using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES), which possesses enhanced sensitivity to functional group chemistry relative to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Analysis of RXES maps show that only a small fraction of total intracellular Pb was complexed by thiol groups. Initial sequestration of Pb in oxides and inorganic phosphate was followed by binding of Pb to organic phosphate, suggesting potential interference in vital cellular functions. These results contrast proposed detoxification responses involving complexation by thiol groups from peptides.

TI Toward an understanding of cell growth and the cell division cycle of
   unicellular photoautotrophic cyanobacteria
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB The cell division cycle of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 6301 in light is characterized by the sequential and orderly appearance of macromolecular synthesis periods. In the dark, macromolecular synthesis and cell division are severely curtailed. When dark-incubated cultures are reexposed to light, a new cell cycle is initiated. The pattern of the cell events displayed by Synechococcus in light and the absence of sustained growth in dark incubation conditions suggests that light-activated regulatory molecules control macromolecular synthesis and the cell division cycle. For example, ribosomal RNA synthesis is stimulated by a light-activated DNA binding factor in light but not in the dark. Light/dark conditions induce cell synchrony in Prochlorococcus. Distinct G1, S and G2 phases characterize cell cycles of marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Cell division in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and marine Synechococcus is controlled by circadian oscillators.

AB We present the new Water Ecosystems Tool (WET), a workflow implemented (as a plugin) in QGIS, for application and evaluation of aquatic ecosystem models. WET provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the coupled one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model GOTM-FABM-PCLake. WET is unique as it enables a standardized and easy-to-use workflow for an otherwise complex model application and is readily applicable to any individual lake and reservoir in the world. WET integrates a platform for model experimentation through scenario simulations - currently encompassing changes in climate and nutrient loads. WET also includes a link to the SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool) watershed model, which can be used to simulate how land use changes affect aquatic ecosystems. The tool is open source and may therefore be readily expanded and adapted for additional model experimentations. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB This study reports different types of natural ecosystems in Jordan subjected to human interference. Mediterranean forest and shrub land ecosystems are severely affected by cutting and fragmentation into farm lands or housing areas, leading to a great loss in biodiversity, especially, rare species, and causing soil erosion and desertification. The second type of system is a unique desert oasis, which is undergoing change by pumping ground water for the past 20 years. It is causing dryness of such unique aquatic system and thus sequentially contributing to loss of precious ecosystem. The third ecosystem is a marginal land area, classified as steppe land belonging to the Irano-Turanian biogeographic vegetation region subject to cultivation under a little rain water. It caused destruction of vegetation, soil erosion and weed spreading. The fourth is a fresh water ecosystem also badly altered by mixing of sewage water effluent. It is causing disappearance of many edible and prominent aquatic plant species. Mitigation measures are needed to overcome these negative alterations.

TI River restoration for macroinvertebrate communities in lowland rivers:
   insights from restorations of the Shibetsu River, north Japan
SO LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Because of human impacts, lowland rivers are among the most degraded running water ecosystems, with their floodplains being the center of human activity. Recently, many programs to restore running water ecosystems have been undertaken using various methods in streams and rivers of North America, Europe, and Far East Asia. However, research and knowledge on the effects of river restoration in lowland rivers are limited around the world. The restoration project involving the first reconstruction of a meandering channel in Asia has been conducted in a lowland river section of the Shibetsu River, northern Japan. We review the geomorphologic and hydraulic characteristics of lowland rivers and their environments for macroinvertebrates and discuss approaches to restoring macroinvertebrate communities in lowland rivers, using insights from the restoration project in the Shibetsu River. It is concluded that the recovery of macroinvertebrate assemblages in channelized lowland rivers requires the implementation of restoration methods to create stable substrates.

CY JAN 28-31, 2004
CL Genoa, ITALY
SP NATO, CCMS
AB Conflicts between nature protection and natural water resources exploitation arise only when intensive use of water recourses provokes stress in water ecosystems. In water management it is very important to define the ecological and human carrying capacity of water ecosystems. Determination of indicators helps to do this. That was one of the goals of the "Integrated Water Management" pilot study. Since 1984 the biggest Lithuanian Druksiai Lake has started to serve as a cooler for the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP). The INPP operation has disturbed the natural hydrological and hydrothermal regime causing intensified evaporation and exerting impact on the lake hydrochemical properties. The above mentioned effects have led to irreversible changes in the unique lake ecosystem. The aim of this case study is to evaluate the changes in the lake ecosystem due to the impact of the nuclear power station. Water temperature is determined as an indicator of the effects in the lake ecosystem.

TI MERCURY CONTAMINATION OF MACROINVERTEBRATES IN FISHLESS GRASSLAND PONDS
SO SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST
AB We surveyed mercury concentrations Of aquatic macroinvertebrates collected from fishless ponds on the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland, Wise County, Texas. Macroinvertebrates representing eight taxonomic groups were collected from 13 ponds in June 2006. Significant differences in concentrations of mercury were detected among taxonomic groups, with the omnivore Hydrophilidae and the predator Notonectidae containing lowest and highest concentrations of mercury, respectively. We also detected significant. differences in concentrations of mercury, in macroinvertebrates among ponds. Concentrations of mercury of some macroinvertebrates were above recommended thresholds for consumption by birds. Our study suggests that fishless ponds can produce large populations of mercury-contaminated macroinvertebrates that could be harmful to aquatic and terrestrial consumers.

TI Metals removal during estuarine mixing of Arvand River water with the
   Persian Gulf water
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
AB In the present study, the removal of dissolved and colloidal Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Zn in Arvand River water during estuarine mixing with the Persian Gulf water is investigated. The flocculation process was investigated for a series of mixtures with salinities ranging from 0.48 to 30.3 parts per thousand. The flocculation rates were indicative of the non-conservative behavior of studied metals during estuarine mixing. Rapid flocculation in the low salinity regimes was observed. The order of the final flocculation rate of metals in the river water was as follows: Co (91.2%)> Cd (86.9%)> Zn (83%)> Cu (75.2%)> Ni (74.3%). Salinity, pH, EC and dissolved oxygen do not govern the flocculation of metals during estuarine mixing. The results of the present investigation show that estuarine processes can be considered as an effective mechanism in self purification of colloidal metals that are anthropogenically introduced into the fresh water ecosystem.

TI Do tributary streams contribute significantly to the transport of faecal

SO AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Faecal pellets (FPs) produced by suspension feeders, notably larval blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae), contribute significantly to the conversion and transport of organic matter in northern rivers. In this study we investigated the relative contribution of tributaries to the flux of FPs in a 7(th) order river in northern Sweden. The influx of FPs to the larger river was positively dependent on tributary sub-catchment area, stream order, channel width, proportion of lakes in the sub-catchment, and current velocity. The contribution was < 45 % of the flux in the large river, but generally it was well below 10% suggesting that the large river transport of FPs is produced within the main channel and not imported from the tributaries, although the latter may significantly support the suspension feeders with food material.

TI Perspectives on Microalgal Biofilm Systems with Respect to Integration
   into Wastewater Treatment Technologies and Phosphorus Scarcity
SO WATER
AB Phosphorus is one of the non-renewable natural resources. High concentration of phosphorus in surface water leads to undesirable eutrophication of the water ecosystem. It is therefore necessary to develop new technologies not only for capturing phosphorus from wastewater but also for phosphorus recovery. The aim of the study was to propose three different integration scenarios for a microalgal biofilm system for phosphorus removal in medium and small wastewater treatment plants, including a comparison of area requirements, a crucial factor in practical application of microalgal biofilm systems. The area requirements of a microalgal biofilm system range from 2.3 to 3.2 m(2)per person equivalent. The total phosphorus uptake seems to be feasible for construction and integration of microalgal biofilm systems into small wastewater treatment plants. Application of a microalgal biofilm for phosphorus recovery can be considered one of the more promising technologies related to capturing CO(2)and releasing of O(2)into the atmosphere.

This did not occur; during the experiment, microbial biomass (as ATP) rose steadily on submerged leaves but remained low on terrestrially-exposed leaves. Densities of most functional feeding groups on the submerged leaves increased with time. Scrapers appeared to be more important than shredders in eucalypt leaf breakdown at both sites.

AB Due to the disruption of water ecosystem Brno reservoir is dealing with problem of heavy cyanobacterial water bloom for the long term. As a spillway dam there is a constant supply of biogenic elements from Svratka basin. In recent years, several measures were implemented to reduce the amount of toxic cyanobacteria. Research was followed by liming of exposed shores, an installation of the aerations towers and by chemical treatment in the river bed.
   Monitoring of the physico - chemical parameters of the water and regular determination and quantification of the phytoplankton community are necessary parts of all water treatment and measures against cyanobacteria. As shown in this study realized measures have been partly effective. Compare to other summer seasons the quantity of cyanobacteria Microcystis in the water dramatically decreased and did not exceed the limit of World health Organization (WHO) for whole vegetation season. It is positive that these realized measures are meaningful and problem of abnormal cyanobacteria development is solvable, but it is still necessary to improve water quality of whole river basin and reduce the supply of biogenic elements into the Brno reservoir.

AB As the water has a vital role in human life and economic development, its shortage can cause some economical, agricultural, industrial and environmental problems. These problems are more prominent in warm and dry regions. Therefore, in such areas the water resources management as well as the treatment and recycling of the mine drainage have the great importance. In the underground and open pit mines, we usually deal with the huge amounts of the contaminated water. In this research, by considering of the statistics of the consumed water and the produced mine drainages during years of 1381, 1382, 1384 and 1385, it was found that the amount of the mine drainages are approximately equal to 70 percent of the total consumed water by mines. Taking water crisis in Iran into account, particularly in dry regions, the mine drainages treatments and recycling of them can be considered for agricultural, water ecosystems and process water in mining industry as an appropriate strategy in order to counter water crisis in mining industry.

However, the steady-state oscillation of basal chitin stock averaged approximately 200 mg C m-2 in both ecosystems.  The production rate of detrital chitin was higher than the decomposition rate in the mesotrophic bog.

Cation exchange experiments using purified clay from this site show relative affinities consistent with the lyotrophic series: Fe2+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ >H+ > K+ >Na+. This relative affinity is confirmed in Fe2+ displacement experiments using natural sediment clay. Proton production during oxidation of salt-treated sediments corresponds to that expected for the oxidation and hydrolysis of Fe2+ displaced from clay interlayers, taking into account the buffering properties of the sediment matrix. This work shows that wetland acidification can occur in low sulfur-containing wetlands and is not exclusively a problem associated with sulfidic sediments.

AB This paper reports on an investigation into determining nanogram/l quantities of mercury in marine and fresh water matrices using a cold vapour generation of mercury, followed by fluorescence detection. Samples were prepared for analysis using a free bromine oxidation technique. A high efficiency gas-liquid separator was used to enhance the detection of mercury. For fresh water, typical method detection limits (MDL) were determined at less than 1 nanogram/l (ng/l). For near shore seawater, the MDL was 1.2 ng/l. Method spikes, which were performed at 20 ng/l, showed mean recoveries within US EPA Contract Laboratory Protocol (CLP) acceptance criteria. System blanks averaged 0.12 ng/l, and recoveries of NIST 1641c diluted to 29.4 ng/l averaged 93.4%. A number of local rivers and streams were sampled, and mercury was determined. All results to date indicate mercury levels below the US EPA chronic water quality criteria for mercury.

TI Model based decision support system for land use changes and
   socio-economic assessments
SO JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB Hydrological models are often linked with other models in cognate sciences to understand the interactions among climate, earth, water, ecosystem, and human society. This paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) that links the outputs of hydrological models with real-time decision making on social-economic assessments and land use management. Discharge and glacier geometry changes were simulated with hydrological model, water availability in semiarid environments. Irrigation and ecological water were simulated by a new commercial software MIKE HYDRO. Groundwater was simulated by MODFLOW. All the outputs of theses hydrological models were taken as inputs into the DSS in three types of links: regression equations, stationary data inputs, or dynamic data inputs as the models running parallel in the simulation periods. The DSS integrates the hydrological data, geographic data, social and economic statistical data, and establishes the relationships with equations, conditional statements and fuzzy logics. The programming is realized in C++. The DSS has four remarkable features: (1) editable land use maps to assist decision-making; (2) conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; (3) interactions among water, earth, ecosystem, and humans; and (4) links with hydrological models. The overall goal of the DSS is to combine the outputs of scientific models, knowledge of experts, and perspectives of stakeholders, into a computer-based system, which allows sustainability impact assessment within regional planning; and to understand ecosystem services and integrate them into land and water management.

TI Optimal management of a eutrophied coastal ecosystem: balancing
   agricultural and municipal abatement measures
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB Agriculture and municipal wastewater are the principal sources of eutrophying nutrients in many water ecosystems. We develop a model which considers the characteristics of agricultural and municipal nutrient abatement. The model explicitly accounts for the investment needed to set up wastewater treatment facilities, and makes it possible to determine the optimal timing of investment as well as the optimal agricultural and municipal abatement levels. We apply the model to the Finnish coastal waters of the Gulf of Finland. Our results indicate that substantial savings in abatement costs and the damage associated with eutrophication could be obtained by constructing the facilities needed to process all the wastewaters entering the coastal ecosystem. The optimal timing of investment is shown to hinge on both the economic and ecological characteristics of the ecosystem.

TI Mapping biodiversity hotspots and conservation priorities for the
   Euro-Mediterranean headwater ecosystems, as inferred from diversity and
   distribution of a water beetle lineage
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Euro-Mediterranean running water ecosystems represent a highly threatened habitat due to draining, construction, agriculture, eutrophication, pollution and climate changes. Thereby, the associated biodiversity is often more threatened compared to any other ecosystem and the identification of biodiversity hotspots and conservation priorities for running water fauna is therefore a primary target. Here we focused on invertebrates, as important indicators of ecosystem functions, modelling a lineage of water beetles and investigating the conservation status of Euro-Mediterranean headwater ecosystems. We selected the "Haenydra" lineage (Hydraenidae, genus Hydraena) as representative taxon (92 species overall, known to occur from Iberian Peninsula to W Iran), analysing a geographic database including literature, field-collecting and Museums data in order to map the distribution of biodiversity hotspots in Euro-Mediterranean headwater systems and locate the running water sites potentially important for invertebrates conservation. We hence assessed the conservation priorities assigning IUCN threat Categories-following IUCN guidelines-to all the species of the lineage, together with a herein introduced Conservation Score (CS) computed using a procedure tailored specifically for water beetles, also analysing historical series. We found that threatened categories (VU or higher), with high CSs, should be assigned to >70% of the species, suggesting that, considering this lineage a representative model, the headwaters conservation status in Euro-Mediterranean areas is alarming. Cantabria, Pyrenees, Alps and Central Apennines were identified as biodiversity hotspots, whereas the combination of IUCN categories and CSs revealed that the areas with highest conservation concern are distributed in W-Alps, E-Alps, Apennines, Central Spain, Greece and N-Turkey. Our analyses suggested a dramatic worsening of running water ecosystems in several Mediterranean regions and in particular in Italy, Greece and Turkey. The comparison between the IUCN categories and the newly introduced CSs evidenced the importance of taking into account the ecological, hydrogeological and historical features when assessing conservation strategies for running water organisms.

The results obtained indicate important role of macrophytic vegetation in aquatic ecosystems, with respect of bioremediation and bioindication, and confirm presumption that chemical analysis of test-species can give very important data, which offer complete picture of ecological status of investigated aquatic ecosystem, and identify plant species that are well hyperaccumulators and test-species for remediation of mentioned pollutants. Aquatic macrophytes can be use in the study of ecological status of water ecosystems and in monitoring of metals and other pollutants, and theirs application can be possible in finding of solutions for problems of protection, sanation and revitalization of those areas.

TI IN-VIVO FLUOROMETRIC METHOD FOR EARLY DETECTION OF CYANOBACTERIAL
   WATERBLOOMS
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB A specific method was developed for monitoring the concentration of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) before waterblooms, based on their characteristics of in vivo fluorescence. The excitation and emission spectra of cyanobacteria are very different from those of eukaryotic algae, due to the importance of phycocyanin, rather than chlorophyll a, in determining the fluorescence characteristics. Our results, based on four cyanobacteria: Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena cylindrica, Phormidium tenue and Spirulina platensis, indicate that excitation at 620 nm and its emission at 645 nm is a sensitive and specific method for their detection. Furthermore, the addition of 10 mu M photosynthesis inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) induced only 3% increase in phycocyanin fluorescence, suggesting that this measurement is almost independent of the ongoing rate of photosynthesis.

TI Carbon sequestration by alga ecosystems
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Algae play an essential role on global carbon cycle and have great potential for CO2 biofixation. The study was to investigate the carbon use potential of microalgae under imitated fresh water ecosystem. Biofixation of CO2 by microalgae mass culture represents an advanced, physicochemical, biological and ecological process that enables direct utilization of CO2 from the atmosphere. This study demonstrated that over 100% carbon source from the air was consumed. The relevant environmental variables were monitored and analyzed, furthermore mathematically selected crucial factors of the unsupplemented freshwater medium growth and finally explained the complexity of the algal nature to provide better insights of the niche in the ecosystem. Consequently, the statistical/mathematical analyses of CO2 uptake rates demonstrated laboratory uptaking atmospheric CO2 as the major carbon source in the algal growth system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Brown trout and European minnow as target species for genotoxicity
   tests: Differential sensitivity to heavy metals
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) were evaluated as target species to carry out genotoxicity tests. Assessment was made of their relative abundance in wild; their distribution areas; and their sensitivity to heavy metals, intraperitoneally exposing individuals of both species to a low dose (1.7 mg/kg body weight) of different heavy metals. Micronuclei were scored in renal erythrocytes 24 h after treatment. Cadmium chloride significantly induced micronuclei in both species whereas mercury nitrate induced micronuclei increase only in brown trout. Brown trout is abundant, present in all studied freshwater ecosystems, and more sensitive to toxic heavy metals than minnow; therefore it is presented as a target species for studies on heavy metal genotoxicity.

We examined the response of a shallow water charophyte community to different types and timing of disturbances by conducting seasonal in situ field experiment in a brackish water ecosystem. The disturbances associated with mechanical removal of vegetation or sediment had the largest impact on the charophyte community. Disturbances that only partly damaged the plants had minor effects and communities were characterized by fast recovery. The timing of disturbance had significant effects on the charophyte community with Stronger effects when disturbed at the early stage compared to mid-stage of seasonal succession.

AB Water shortage problem is increasingly becoming the focus of great concern to everyone in the world. First, we develop two models Macroscopic Model and Microscopic Model to measure the ability of a region to provide clean water. We calculate the amount of water supply and demand approximately, and we adopt a Macro-Model to measure the water provision ability in a large region. While the Micro-Model concentrates on the dynamic nature of the factors. Then we use the unified criteria and determine the weighs via the AHP, working out an indicator to reflect the ability to provide clean water in a certain region. Second, we pick Beijing for further study. We conclude that the water is heavily overloaded in Beijing, mainly caused by the large population. Finally, our intervention plan is to build a new dam in Beijing. Applying the goal programming, we determine the specific way to build this dam. Our primary goal is to mitigate water scarcity in Beijing, namely improve water availability. Meanwhile, our minor aim is to minimize the investment of this dam projection. Additionally, we analyze the influence on the surrounding areas and the entire water ecosystem.

TI Diatom mediated heavy metal remediation: A review
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Exposure to heavy metals is a major threat to aquatic bodies and is a global concern to our four main spheres of the earth viz. atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. The biosorption of pollutants using naturally inspired sources like microalgae has considerable advantages. Diatoms are the most dominant and diverse group of phytoplankton which accounts for 45% oceanic primary productivity. They perform a pioneer part in the biogeochemistry of metals in both fresh and marine water ecosystems. The diatoms play a significant role in degradation, speciation, and detoxification of chemical wastes and hazardous metals from polluted sites. Herein, an overview is presented about the ability of diatom algae to phycoremediate heavy metals by passive adsorption and active assimilation from their aqueous environments with an emphasis on extracellular and intracellular mechanisms involved in contaminant uptake through the frustules for preventing heavy metal toxicity.

AB Assessment of contamination levels of the water ecosystem with polychlorinated biphenyls was evaluated in different fish samples (muscle, skin, viscera) from the Brno water reservoir. There were examined 24 fish, of which 8 predatory (species: Aspius aspius - asp, Perca fluviatilis - european perch, Sander lucioperca - pike perch) and 16 omnivorous (species: Abramis bjoerkna - silver bream, Rutilus rutilus - common roach, Carassius carassius - crucian carp, Abramis brama - common bream, Tinca tinca - tench), altogether. Because PCBs well accumulate in fats, the fat percentage must be extracted from each sample first. We conduct our analysis using the High Resolution Gas Chromatography (HRGC) on two different columns connected in parallel to one injection port with two mu-BCD detectors at their ends. Real samples of fish tissues were analyzed using this system. We focused our attention on PCB indicator congeners no. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180, and the sum of PCBs. Measured values were compared with the legislation; there were compared differences between PCB concentrations in samples of predatory and omnivorous fish, as well as differences in the distribution of individual PCB congeners into different fish tissues. Samples of water and sediment taken from the reservoir were examined together with samples of fish tissues.

AB The effect of climate change on water ecosystems include increased winter precipitation, severe floods, leading to fluctuations in stream flow in areas and affecting both fish survival and water supplies. Several methods exist for establishing projections of changes in precipitation with regards to river flows and water levels at the river-basin scale, but hydrological characteristics change remain difficult to predict. Ensuring optimization techniques for water systems becomes significantly important especially with the degradation of water ecosystems and increased risks for fish population.
   On the other hand, water demand has increased in the recent periods with the population growth. Further changes in the irrigation water system demand are determined by climate change precluding the reliability of current water management systems and affecting on the water-related ecosystems.
   To address these challenges real time water management and optimization strategies are required to facilitate a more autonomous management process that can address requirements for water demand, supply and ecosystem preservation.
   We present a cognitive based decision system that performs river level prediction for water optimization and catchment regulation for preserving Usk reservoir ecosystem in South Wales. The research is conducted on the Usk reservoir in South Wales reservation that is seeking to preserve the ecosystem and for which we propose a more informed decision system for catchment regulation and water management. Our system provides five days river level prediction to regulate river levels by pumping from/to reservoirs and to create artificial spates during the salmon migration season and to coincide with periods of low river flow.

TI Human Perturbation of the Global Phosphorus Cycle: Changes and
   Consequences
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The phosphorus (P) cycle is an important Earth system process. While natural P mobilization is slow, humans have been altering P cycle by intensifying P releases from lithosphere to ecosystems. Here, we examined magnitudes of which humans have altered the P cycles by integrating the estimates from recent literatures, and furthermore illustrated the consequences. Based on our synthesis, human alterations have tripled the global P mobilization in land-water continuum and increased P accumulation in soil with 6.9 +/- 3.3 Tg-P yr(-1). Around 30% of atmospheric P transfer is caused by human activities, which plays a significant role than previously thought. Pathways involving with human alterations include phosphate extraction, fertilizers application, wastes generation, and P losses from cropland. This study highlights the importance of sustainable P supply as a control on future food security because of regional P scarcity, food demand increase and continuously P intensive food production. Besides, accelerated P loads are responsible for enhanced eutrophication worldwide, resulting in water quality impairment and aquatic biodiversity losses. Moreover, the P enrichment can definitely stimulate the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, implying the great need for incorporating P in models predicting the response of carbon and nitrogen cycles to global changes.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Human society has a profound adverse effect on natural assets as human populations increase and as global climate changes. We need to envisage different futures that encompass plausible human responses to threats and change, and become more mindful of their likely impacts on natural assets. We describe a method for developing a set of future scenarios for a natural asset at national scale under ongoing human population growth and climate change. The method involves expansive consideration of potential drivers of societal change, a reduction of these to form a small set of key drivers to which contrasting settings are assigned, which we use to develop a set of different scenarios. We use Australia's native biodiversity as the focus to illustrate the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Testing the Influence of Incomplete DNA Barcode Libraries on Ecological
   Status Assessment of Mediterranean Transitional Waters
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary: The biodiversity and ecological status assessment of transitional water ecosystems by benthicmacroinvertebrates investigation could use DNA barcode tools for more rapid and efficient outputs. The principal limits of this application are the incompleteness of DNA barcode databases, the identification of optimal primers set, and the gap in the species sequences. The influence of the incompleteness of DNA barcode libraries on species diversity indices, ecological indicators, and ecological status assessment in transitional waters of the southeast Mediterranean were analysed, underlying the importance to implement DNA barcode libraries and to put an effort toward specific species at a local level.
   The ecological assessment of European aquatic ecosystems is regulated under the framework directives on strategy for water and marine environments. Benthic macroinvertebrates are the most used biological quality element for ecological assessment of rivers, coastal-marines, and transitional waters. The morphological identification of benthic macroinvertebrates is the current tool for their assessment. Recently, DNA-based tools have been proposed as effective alternatives. The main current limits of DNA-based applications include the incompleteness of species recorded in the DNA barcode reference libraries and the primers bias. Here, we analysed the influence of the incompleteness of DNA barcode databases on species diversity indices, ecological indicators, and ecological assessment in transitional waters of the southeast Mediterranean, taking into account the availability of commonly sequenced and deposited genomic regions for listed species. The ecological quality status assigned through the potential application of both approaches to the analysed transitional water ecosystems was different in 27% of sites. We also analysed the inter-specific genetic distances to evaluate the potential application of the DNA metabarcoding method. Overall, this work highlights the importance to expand the barcode databases and to analyse, at the regional level, the gaps in the DNA barcodes.

A distinctive features of its species composition is dominance of widespread species Assulina muscorum, Arcella arenaria, Phryganella hemisphaerica, and Euglypha laevis in the absence of common sphagnobionts of the genera Nebela, Hyalosphenia, and Heleopera. Vertical heterogeneity of the community structure is weakly manifested, since dominant species are abundant in all horizons. The highest species richness is characteristic of the marginal community formed at the boundary between a sphagnum quagmire and a reed grass-dominated fen.

TI Preliminary results of water quality assessment using phytoplankton and

SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. In July and December 2013, two field investigations were carried out at 10 sites along the main streams of the basin. The monitoring indices contained both physicochemical variables and the structure and composition of phytoplankton communities. The correlations between communities and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Moreover, water quality was evaluated using the comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Results indicated that more phytoplankton species were present in December than in July, but total density was less in December. Phytoplankton communities in the midstream of the Shaying River were affected by the same physicochemical factors throughout the year, but ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus had the greatest influence on these sites in July and December, respectively. The water pollution status of the sampling sites was much greater in the Shaying River midstream than at other sites. TLI was more suitable than H for assessing water quality in the study area. These results provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable basin management in the HRB.

TI Ecological service assessment of human-dominated freshwater ecosystem
   with a case study in Yangzhou Prefecture, China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Freshwater ecosystems provide a host of services to humanity. These services are now rapidly being lost, not least because of the inability of making the impacts measurable. To overcome this obstacle, assessment frameworks for freshwater ecosystem services are needed. A simple water equivalent framework to assess the ecological services provided by freshwater ecosystems was developed in this study. It translated the occupation of freshwater ecosystem services into biologically freshwater volumes and then compares this consumption to the freshwater throughput, that is, the ecological capacity available in this region. In this way, we use the example of Yangzhou Prefecture, to account the main categories of human occupation of water ecosystem services. The result showed that there is a huge gap between the consumption and the supply of freshwater ecosystem services. This must encourage local government to make land-use and water management decisions both economically rational and environmentally sound.

SO INLAND WATER BIOLOGY
AB For populations of the genus Typha L., various natural and anthropogenic water pools in the Cenozoic serve as paths of migration, objects of geographic isolation which interfere with the exchange of populations. These processes lead to crosses of closely related populations and the formation of new species on a hybridogenic basis. With the intensification of the anthropogenic factor on water systems within Russia, intersectional hybrids have formed, marking a convergence (destabilization) of Typha. The appearance of hybrids of such rank is favored by the intensive multipurpose exploitation of water bodies of Russia throughout the centuries. Under climate warming in stabilized transformed water ecosystems, populations of Typha adapting to different environments are integrating, passing on to a new evolutionary level.

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
AB Single values of the cation exchange capacity (CEC) are widely used in modeling soil solution chemistry in soil and water ecosystems. Our aim was to determine the CEC as a function of pH and ionic strength in an acidic forest soil. We examined the cation exchange of two Humo-Ferric Podzols (Haplorthods) equilibrated with artificial soil solutions of different concentrations. Aliquots of acid (HCl) or base (NaOH) were added to generate a pH range of 3 to 6. The CEC, determined by displacement with BaCl2 showed little or no increase with increasing pH and a definite increase with lower pH. This anomalous behavior was attributed to the precipitation of aluminum (Al) at high pH and to its dissolution at low pH.

TI Water assessment in a peri-urban watershed in Mexico City: A focus on an
   ecosystem services approach
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Among hydrological ecosystem services, water supply is one of the most relevant to society because of its role in human wellbeing; accordingly, it has been significantly modified worldwide. There has been a recent increase in the necessity of combining methods and tools to create interdisciplinary evaluations of water ecosystem services, especially in developing countries where there is a lack of systematized and updated socioenvironmental information. We propose a framework for the assessment of water supply ecosystem services that includes environmental, social and economic dimensions. We describe and develop each of these dimensions with a particular focus on identifying the key variables that are needed to answer them. First, we performed research of the literature regarding the evaluation methods that are sufficiently flexible to apply them to local scales in countries where information is limited. Then, we chose the Magdalena River Watershed to apply this perspective because it is an illustrative area of vital importance to Mexico City's ecosystem services. We believe that this proposal has outlined basic guidelines to help decision makers improve water management and may provide an opportunity to change public policies on peri-urban ecosystems.

SO GEODERMA
AB Small holder farmers throughout Bangladesh operate in small but diverse ecosystems and possess a deep intimate knowledge of local soils. They have developed soil management strategies that helped them to attain a high degree of sustainability. In this study, a group of small holder farmers from a village in the saline water ecosystem in southwestern Bangladesh were interviewed to explore the depth of their knowledge of soils. Data collected from a parallel scientific study done in the same village revealed that the village farmers possessed considerable knowledge of local soils, their classification, and management problems. Farmers' typology of soils differed from their scientific classification because of the diversity in objectives and approaches to study the village soils. Despite their lack of knowledge of the soil genesis and morphology and soil chemistry, farmers qualitatively identified major typology, properties, and constraints of topsoil, and have developed strategies through generation-long practical on-farm experiments that helped them to maintain a sustainable agricultural system in the village. Farmers' knowledge of soils is, therefore, a vast resource that should be tapped and incorporated in the national scientific database and utilized in formulating future agricultural development policies.

Six replicates of a 10-day experiment using river water in continuous flow chemostat systems were conducted. Each replicate used three chemostats, one serving as a control to which no antibiotic was added and the other two receiving low and high doses of CTC (8 mu g/liter and 800 mu g/liter, respectively). The addition of CTC to the chemostats did not impact the overall level of cultivable aerobic bacteria (P = 0.51). The high-CTC chemostat had significantly higher tetracycline-resistant bacterial colony counts than both the low-CTC and the control chemostats (P < 0.035). The differences in resistance between the low-CTC and control chemostats were highly nonsignificant (P = 0.779). In general a greater diversity of tet resistance genes was detected in the high-CTC chemostat and with a greater frequency than in the low-CTC and control chemostats. Low levels of CTC in this in vitro experiment did not select for increased levels of tetracycline resistance among cultivable aerobic bacteria. This finding should not be equated with the absence of environmental risk, however. Low concentrations of antibiotics in the environment may select for resistant bacterial populations once they are concentrated in sediments or other locations.

TI Modelling the structural dynamics of a shallow and eutrophic water
   ecosystem based on mesocosm observations
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB A structural dynamic model describing a shallow, eutrophic water ecosystem is proposed in this paper. This type of model is useful for predicting the effects of biomanipulation. Various examples of this kind of model have been suggested in previous reports. The next salient issue demanding attention would be calibrating such models on the basis of more rigid data. In this paper, some of model parameters were calibrated and validated on the basis of observations of a mesocosm. In the mesocosm, almost complete material balances can be measured; these allow for the control of important factors in such systems. Hence, mesocosm observations were used in the calibration of parameters. The calibrated model was strongly supported on the basis of other observations of the mesocosm. The simulation study used in the proposed model indicated that the effects of biomanipulation on algal growth suppression differs depending on their zooplankton composition.

TI Gaps in the protection of European lakes
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB Protected areas represent the main tool for halting the continuing loss of biological diversity. The number and extent of protected areas is gradually increasing, but this expansion does not always ensure the efficient protection of key species, habitats, and ecosystem functioning. Today, the Natura 2000 network encompasses more than 27 000 sites, representing the cornerstone of conservation strategies throughout Europe. About one-fifth of the terrestrial surface of the European Union (EU) is now covered by the Natura 2000 network; yet, knowledge remains limited about its efficiency to encompass inland water ecosystems sufficiently. This study aimed to determine the extent to which the Natura 2000 network covers 5132 European lakes that host fish species and freshwater lake habitat types of conservation interest. A key question investigated was whether the protection coverage of the water bodies reflects the coverage of the terrestrial areas surrounding the lakes. Geographical, socio-economic, and political parameters were considered as potential descriptors of the observed patterns. The results demonstrated that although most of these sensitive ecosystems have high protection coverage at water body level, Natura 2000 largely ignores their surroundings. At the catchment level, lower conservation coverage was detected, raising concerns about whether the network offers sufficient protection to wetland species, habitats, and ecosystem functioning against numerous threats operating in the terrestrial areas surrounding water bodies. The results also identified different patterns of coverage in different EU Member States, which might reflect a lack of common practices regarding the implementation of key EU directives. This study highlighted the necessity of redefining conservation planning towards a systematic, integrated approach. The spatial properties of the landscape and the distribution of potential pressures should be considered at the catchment level of water bodies, as these pressures alter the functionality and services of inland water ecosystems.

TI Viruses of microorganisms in the Baltic Sea: current state of research
   and perspectives
SO MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB This paper reviews the current state of research into viruses of microorganisms in the Baltic Sea. Field and experimental studies reveal the great phenotypic and genotypic variety of the Baltic Sea viruses and highlights the importance of phages in the Baltic Sea food-web dynamics. In total, 93 virus isolates from the Baltic Sea have been described, the genome sequence being available for 39 of these. However, these isolates were derived from only eight host species and, therefore, underrepresent the overall viral diversity in the Baltic Sea. The most studied group of viruses is bacteriophages that infect Bacteroidetes, whereas, by contrast, phages of Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, as well as algal viruses, have been investigated to a lesser extent. No reports on viruses infecting Baltic Sea fungi and archaea isolates have been reported to date. This paper also identifies gaps in our knowledge of the aquatic virology of the Baltic Sea and emphasizes the need for more comprehensive analysis of those viruses that occur in one of the world's largest brackish water ecosystems.

TI Assessment of Water Yield and Water Purification Services in the Arid
   Zone of Northwest China: The Case of the Ebinur Lake Basin
SO LAND
AB Assessing how land-use changes will affect water-producing ecosystem services is particularly important for water resource management and ecosystem conservation. In this study, the InVEST model and geographical detector were used to assess the water ecosystem service functions of the Ebinur Lake Basin and analyze their relationship with land-use changes. The results show that in the past 25 years, the water yield of the study area showed a trend of a strong yield at first and then a weaker one; there was a relatively large water yield in the west and southeast regions of the basin. The order of water yield for different land-use types is as follows: forest land > grassland > water area > unused land > crop land > construction land. After 2010, the output load of nitrogen and phosphorus increased; thus, the water purification ability weakened. The main land-use types in areas that demonstrate a large change rate in water purification capacity in the basin are cultivated land and construction land. Changes in the two water ecosystem services were associated with land-use changes. Geodetector analysis results further validated this conclusion. This study proposes a viable, replicable framework for land-use decisions in ecologically fragile watersheds. This study not only helps to gain insight into urban growth patterns in the study area but also helps to inform different land-use stakeholders.

TI Algicidal effect of hybrid peptides as potential inhibitors of harmful
   algal blooms
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Objectives To biochemically characterize synthetic peptides to control harmful algal blooms (HABs) that cause red tides in marine water ecosystems.
   Results We present an analysis of several short synthetic peptides and their efficacy as algicidal agents. By altering the amino acid composition of the peptides we addressed the mode of algicidal action and determine the optimal balance of cationic and hydrophobic content for killing. In a controlled setting, these synthetic peptides disrupted both plasma and chloroplast membranes of several species known to result in HABs. This disruption was a direct result of the hydrophobic and cationic content of the peptide. Furthermore, by using an anti-HAB bioassay in scallops, we determined that these peptides were algicidal without being cytotoxic to other marine organisms.
   Conclusions These synthetic peptides may prove promising for general marine ecosystem remediation where HABs have become widespread and resulted in serious economic loss.

TI Water-related Ecosystem Services and Food Security
SO MANAGING WATER AND AGROECOSYSTEMS FOR FOOD SECURITY
SE Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture Series
AB The ecosystem setting of both agriculture and water provides a conceptual framework for managing the needs of agriculture for water and the impacts of water upon agriculture. Water underpins all benefits (ecosystem services) that ecosystems provide, including all agricultural production. The availability of water, in terms of both its quantity and quality, is also influenced heavily by ecosystem functioning. Understanding this relationship of water, ecosystems and their services with agriculture is at the heart of understanding, and therefore managing, water and food security. There are opportunities to move beyond seeing the agriculture-ecosystem-water interface as one of conflict and trade-offs, towards simultaneously achieving both increases in sustainable food production and improvements in the delivery of other ecosystem benefits by agriculture through more widespread adoption of ecosystem-based solutions. These concepts and approaches are explained briefly here as an introduction to understanding the interlinkages between ecosystem services, water and food security in subsequent chapters of the book.

AB Two lakes in Trakai district - Didziulis and Lentvaris were heavily polluted in the past by discharges of municipal wastewater without proper treatment. This anthropogenic impact resulted in large amounts of bottom sludge in both lakes, high amounts of biogenic substances and deterioration of water ecosystems. In both lakes, methods of mechanical lake restoration were applied in 2008 by removing 80000 m(3) of bottom sludge from the northern part of Lake Didziulis and 60000 m(3) of bottom sludge from the southern part of Lake Lentvaris. The objectives of this article are 1) to examine composition of local macrozoobenthos communities in both lakes prior and after sludge removal and 2) evaluate changes and trends of ecological status in restored parts of both lakes by using two most popular in Lithuania indices based on macrozoobenthos: Trent Biotic Index and Danish River Fauna Index.

AB Eutrophication of reservoirs used for drinking water supplies is a very common problem, particularly in lowland reservoirs. Long water retention time (60-120 days) favours cyanobacterial bloom occurrence in Sulejow Reservoir, Poland. The localisation of the water intake in a bay exposed to north-east winds favoured the Microcystis bloom accumulation, which formed a 0.5 m thick dense scum for the first time in September 1999. Cyanobacterial hepatotoxins can pose a potential health problem because the presence of about 0.8 mug/1 microcystins was detected in drinking water during three series of analysis. An investigation of the efficiency of each stage of water treatment processes in the elimination of microcystins showed that pre-chlorination, coagulation, and rapid sand filtration were ineffective in removing microcystins from water. Significant elimination was observed after ozonation and chlorination. The concentration of microcystins in bloom material was between 12 to 860 mug/g dry weight of phytoplankton biomass. Management strategies for reservoirs should consider the important role of ecohydrological processes, which are often very easy to regulate, and which can be useful for bio-manipulation of the water ecosystem.

SO SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB Scientific documentation on (Microplastics)MPs abundance in Malaysian waters is still limited and not fully understood. In this study, MPs occurrence in Sungai Dungun, Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia was analysed. Sampling method was based on sieving 200 mu m of bulk water to collect surface water samples from five sites in the vicinity of potential source for MP abundance. Characterisation of MPs was accomplished by gravimetric and digital image processing (for quantification and morphology categorisation), and chemical composition identified by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier infrared spectroscopy. The range concentration of MPs was 22.8 to 300.8 items/m(3) (mean 102.8 item/m(3)). It was recorded that most of the MPs found were black and transparent. The most frequent morphotypes were fibres, followed by fragments. Polypropylene (C3H6)n, polyacrylonitrile (C3H3N)n and rayon were the dominant polymertypes of MPs analysed in this work Metals (Pb < As < Mn < Zn < Cu < Fe < Al) found within the MPs reported varied in terms of mu g/mL. This study provided new insights into the understanding of MP levels in inland Malaysian freshwater environments.

AB The plankton is an incredibly large group of organisms. As a fatal component in the ocean, their distribution and richness can impact on the material cycle of the water ecosystem and the balance of ecological system. Thus it's a valuable work to detect and identify plankton. We will be able to alert against the red tide if our equipment can automatically identify them. The main deficiency is that data in the main plankton datasets are quite imbalanced, i. e. some species have more than 100,000 images while some others have only less than 10 images in one dataset. Imbalanced learning has been a research emphasis in recent years because of the growing number of class-imbalanced classification problems. The problem is particularly problematic when it comes to plankton classification. We proposed a new algorithm EasyEnsemble. D to overcome this deficiency. EasyEnsemble. D samples subsets from majority classes and classify them according to different weight. Then output the combination of each weak learner. The results show that as for ZooScan dataset, EasyEnsemble. D has higher F-measure and G-mean values than other imbalanced learning methods. It can be used in both dichotomy problems and multiple problems.

TI Water Quality Assessment in Lakes of Vojvodina
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB This study focused on use of bacterial extracellular enzyme activities as biochemical parameters, along with the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics, in a comprehensive assessment of water quality of four lake ecosystems in the Province of Vojvodina (northern Serbia): Provala, Ludas, Zobnatica and Palic. Water samples were collected in June and October, 2008. For assessment of microbiological water quality, heterotrophic plate count, total and fecal coliform count, as well as total bacterial count was determined. Based on microbiological parameters, the water ecosystems were appropriately classified. The following extracellular enzyme activities were determined: alkaline phosphatase, beta-D-glucosidase and acetate esterase using fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferone labeled substrates. The results showed that Provala Lake had the best water quality taking in consideration all of the parameters, followed by Zobnatica, while Ludas and Palic had a significant level of organic water pollution both in June and October. The results indicate that further similar studies should include both microbiological and biochemical analyses, in order to obtain more relevant data on water quality.

Magnetic chitosan (CS) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMC) nanocomposites have been synthesized by a simple one-step chemical coprecipitation method. The nanoparticles were assessed for the removal of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions from aqueous solution. Kinetic and thermodynamic models were used to describe and understand the adsorption process of the ions onto the nanomaterials. The interactions between the ions and the biopolymer-based composites are reversible, which means that the nanoparticles can be regenerated in weakly acidic or EDTA containing solution without losing their activity and stability for water cleanup applications.

TI Investigation and assessment of ecological water resources in the salt
   marsh area of a salt lake: A case study of West Taijinar Lake in the
   Qaidam Basin, China
SO PLOS ONE
AB The water ecology of salt marshes plays a crucial role in climate regulation, industrial production, and flood control. Due to a poor understanding of water ecology and the extensive mining of salt resources, concerns are mounting about declining groundwater levels, shrinking salt marshes, and other problems associated with the simple yet extremely fragile water ecosystem of salt marshes in arid salt lake areas. This study assessed the ecological status of water resources in the downstream salt marsh area of West Taijinar Lake in the Qaidam Basin, China (2010-2018). Using data from a field investigation, the water ecosystem was divided into an ecological pressure subsystem, an environmental quality subsystem, and a socio-economic subsystem according to an analytic hierarchy process. Each subsystem was quantitatively assessed using the ecological footprint model, the single-factor index, and available data for the salt marsh area. The results showed that water resources were always in a surplus state during the study period, whose development and utilization had a safe status. Surface water had low plankton diversity with no evidence of eutrophication, but its Cl- and SO42- concentrations were too high for direct industrial water uses. Groundwater quality was classified into class V because of high salt concentrations, which could be considered for industrial use given the demand of industrial production. The socio-economic efficiency of water resources was high, as distinguished by decreased water consumption per 10,000 yuan GDP and excellent flood resistance. In conclusion, the ecological status of water resources was deemed good in the study area and this could help sustain regional development. However, since the water ecology in this area is mainly controlled by annual precipitation, it would be challenging to deal with the uneven distribution of precipitation and flood events and to make full use of them for groundwater recharge. This study provides insight into the impact of salt lake resource exploration on water ecology, and the results can be useful for the rational utilization of water resources in salt marshes in other arid areas.

TI Analyzing Stakeholder Perceptions of Water Ecosystem Services to Enhance
   Resilience in the Middle Draa Valley, Southern Morocco
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Freshwater ecosystems deliver an extensive range of ecosystem services (ESs), which are the benefits people obtain from their interaction with nature. Increasing pressure on water resources threatens the sustainable supply of water-related ecosystem services, especially in arid regions, as is the case for the Draa Valley located in southern Morocco. With the long-term objective of contributing to a sustainable supply of important ecosystem services in the Draa Valley, this paper analyzes stakeholder perceptions of water-related ecosystem services (WESs). To assess the different perceptions of WES, 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the inhabitants of three oases in the middle Draa Valley, as well as 12 other interviews with key government officials. Based on our interviews, we reflect on two of the policy-relevant generic principles proposed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre for enhancing the resilience of WESs. Our results reveal similarities in perceptions of WES among stakeholder groups regarding provisioning services but marked differences regarding regulating and cultural services. The analysis suggests that these differences stem from stakeholders' different roles and activities in the area. In addition, socio-demographic, biophysical, and spatial aspects also shape how WESs are perceived in the area. Learning about similarities in WES perceptions can help build common ground among stakeholders. The recognition of differences can also assist the balancing of the different needs and interests of these groups. ESs perception assessment can contribute to strengthened stakeholder knowledge of the categories of ESs and provide a common ground for participating in ES-related decision making, hence enhancing resilience in social-ecological systems.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB In order to promote the construction of a beautiful China, 14th five year plan is started. The basic conditions of water ecological environment in Hainan Province are good, but in recent years, the function of water ecosystem is degraded and the improvement of water environment quality is limited. China has integrated the "three water" of water environment to set the water resources and water ecology into the goal index and task engineering setting of the special plan for water ecological environment protection. But the China's water ecological environment protection strategy needs to comprehensively consider the connection between space development and protection, industrial green development, ecosystem protection and restoration and traditional water pollution control. So, integrated protection strategy is carried out in this process. Scientific and feasible integrated protection strategies promote the construction of beautiful rivers in Hainan Island, and provide reference for other provinces in China to carry out water ecological environment protection in the medium and long term.

TI Freshwater Cyanobacterial Blooms and Cyanotoxin Production in Serbia in
   the Past 25 Years
SO GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
AB Since 1980 cyanobacterial blooms occurred in a large number of reservoirs, lakes and water flows (rivers and channels) in Serbia. Among 83 water ecosystems examined, 58 were found in blooming condition almost every year during last 2 decades. All natural lakes, accumulations, rivers and chanals in Vojvodina province (agricultural part) proved to be sites with frequent cyanobacterial proliferation. During the summer 2005-spring 2006 microcystin-LR survey in Vojvodina, the toxin was permanently present in all examined ecosystems and the highest value of 362.68 mu gL(-1) was detected in Ludos Lake.
   The part of Central Serbia is very problematic for ground water supply. For that reason more than 20 reservoirs serve as drinking water suppliers. Significant and persistant cyanobacterial blooms have been recognized in 9 of them. Samples for cyanotoxin analyses were taken during and after blooms in Celije Reservoir and in drinking water in Krusevac town 2 days later. Concentration of microcystin-LR was 650 mu gL(-1) in the reservoir, while the tap water contained 2.5 mu gL(-1).

AB The changes in sorption properties of products obtained by modification of water insoluble lignins, wood chemical processing wastes, with silicon containing oligomers and bactericide cations: quaternary ammonium and Cu2+, were characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, hydrophilic-oleophilic properties, model tests towards different organic contaminants, incl. microorganisms. Goal oriented modification of lignin with Si- and N- containing compounds providing appearance in its structure of novel functional groups, reaction sites and variation in matrix rigity allowed to regulate products porous structure and in prospective to obtain efficient sorbents for terrestrial and water ecosystems able to sequestrate and inhibit action of hazardous contaminants and promote biodegradation. Combination of Si-modified lignin, used as a matrix, with inorganic cation Cu2+ (a guest phase) results in obtaining of organic-inorganic (OI) hybrid material with an additional dimension to their properties: improved sorption capability towards organic contaminants and high antipathogenic activity. The latter was exemplified by model tests with E.Coli and B.-Subtilis: the vital activity of all bacteria sorbed was suppressed.

TI Lacustrine diatoms in the Hudson Bay and James Bay area of Quebec -
   Reconstruction of dissolved organic carbon concentrations
SO ECOSCIENCE
AB Freshwater diatoms are more and mon frequently used in paleoenvironmental studies. The purpose of this research was to assess their potential as bioindicators in a region where little information exists about diatoms. A total of 516 diatom species were identified in the surface sediments of 59 lakes located along a latitudinal,gradient in northern Quebec. The use of multivariate analysis allowed to determine the environmental variables (among 49) which had the greatest influence on diatom community composition. The concentrations of magnesium, sodium, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and silica, as well as water depth seemed to be the most influential variables. An inference model for DOC has been developed which is useful for paleolimnological reconstructions of past DOC concentrations, as well as other variables that are correlated with DOG, such as catchment inputs, water temperature, water transparency and UV penetration.

AB The relative importance of potential carbon sources in the littoral of Lake Gooimeer, a lake in the centre of the Netherlands, was studied using a combination of C-13/C-12-ratio analysis and carbohydrate composition analysis. The littoral is covered on the land side by a 80 m wide Phragmites australis bed. Potential carbon sources were macrophyte litter, seston and benthic algae. Samples of potential carbon sources, sediments and benthic macrofauna from inside and outside the bed were analyzed for their C-13/C-12-ratio and some for their carbohydrate composition. Results indicate that inside the bed, macrophyte litter was the main source of carbon for both the sediment organic matter and the benthic macrofauna, and that algal material was of minor importance. Outside the bed, production by benthic algae was the main carbon source, with seston as a second source. No macrophyte derived material could be detected outside the reed bed.

TI PLANKTONIC ECOSYSTEMS IN THE CHANNEL - TROPHIC RELATIONS
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB Four planktonic coastal ecosystems from the western Channel to the southern part of the North Sea have been compared. The characteristics of the south of the North Sea are a very high planktonic biomass with an annual maximum value of 45 mg C m-3 h-1 for primary production, a maximum of 11 mg m-3 for Chlorophyll a and 60 mg C m-3 for zooplanktonic biomass (expressed in term of carbon weight), linked with an oscillating ecosystem. In the western Channel primary production shows an annual maximum value of 8 mg C m-3 h-1, die chlorophyll a, a maximum of 2.5 mg m-3 and zooplanktonic carbon weight of 14 mg C m-3 linked to a greater inertia in the system. Turnover is faster in the north. Trophic efficiency ratios have been calculated and linked to hydrodynamic conditions and currents. The impacts of a thermal perturbation from a nuclear power plant effluent (DT 11-degrees - 15-degrees-C) applied to ecosystems are compared.

TI Designing citizen science for water and ecosystem services management in
   data-poor regions: Challenges and opportunities
SO CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB While the citizen science approach has gained prominence in water and ecosystem services management, methodological limitations, insufficient resources invested in monitoring practices and a lack of effective mechanisms for integrating the approach into existing monitoring and decision making processes means that its full potential has yet to be realized. Nevertheless, the concept offers a real opportunity to address data gaps and assist decision makers operating under a wide range of socio-ecological and environmental uncertainties. In this paper, we report findings from a project in which low-cost sensors were deployed to collect hydrological data in two study locations in Nepal. We found evidence that the citizen science has potential to generate locally relevant data and knowledge which can enrich a much more polycentric governance of water ecosystem services management. However, some major challenges need to be overcome, in particular developing locally-tailored monitoring sensors, standardizing monitoring and data sharing practice, improving local capabilities to collect quality data and making the approach more sustainable and adaptive to emerging environmental threats and uncertainties. If sufficient attention can be given to these key challenges, citizen science looks set to play a significant future role in water and ecosystem services management.

TI Assessing the Fish Stock Status in Lake Trichonis: A Hydroacoustic
   Approach
SO WATER
AB Fish stock monitoring is an important element for the sustainable management of inland water resources. A scarcity of data and the lack of systematic monitoring for Lake Trichonis precludes an up-to-date assessment. To assess the current status of pelagic fish stock, a hydroacousting survey was conducted for the first time in Lake Trichonis, Greece. In October 2019, the lake was acoustically surveyed with two, horizontally and vertically mounted, 120 kHz transducers during day and night. A decreasing gradient in pelagic fish density from the western to the eastern shores of the lake was observed. Fish density was significantly higher in the intermediate layers of the water column, in the eastern region, compared to the western region. The lake appears to host primarily communities of small-sized fish (TL: 0-5 cm), whereas larger fish (TL: 5-50 cm) are a small minority of the total fish stock. The overall average estimated fish length was approximately 2.4 cm. The adoption of routine inland fish stock monitoring through hydroacoustic methods could be a promising step in the effort to improve the understanding of unique inland water ecosystems with minimum impact on endemic species, as well as to mitigate human impact and achieve long-term sustainable management.

Domestic wastewater is a high concentration of oil wastewater and if it is discharged directly without treatment, it will affect the water body reoxygenation and its self-purification process, which endangers the water ecosystem. The study tried to tackle the problem from the morphology and physiology perspective of microorganisms. The sewage water samples were taken from a residential area and eight cold-adapted strains with high oil degradation capacity were isolated and at the temperature of 5 degrees C. The bacteria were identified and determined the genus through physiological and biochemical tests and fatty acid identification system. The effect of pH value on the oil degradation rate was investigated. The results showed that the optimal culture conditions were 5 degrees C, 7.0 of initial pH, peanut oil as carbon source. Under the conditions, the bacteria had the higher degradation capacity.

AB Metagenomic analysis of biofilm forming bacteria in environmental samples remains challenging due to the non-availability of gene sequences of most of the uncultivable bacteria. Sequences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-UW genes involved either directly or indirectly in biofilm formation were analyzed using BLASTn to obtain matching sequences from different strain, species and genus. Conserved regions in the functional domain of the amino acid sequences were used to design common primers for direct PCR analysis of freshwater metagenomes. Seven key genes such as aceA, clpP, typA, cbrA, phoR, rpoS and gacA involved in biofilm formation were validated. The ortholog genes belonged to wide range of Pseudomonas sp. indicating the diversity of biofilm genes and the conservation of protein functional domains. The approach would also help in analyzing the expression of biofilm genes in different bacteria of freshwater systems for monitoring toxic contaminations such as organic or inorganic pollutants.

   on the ecosystem elements of the Gulf of Riga
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB There is currently a critical knowledge gap in how eutrophication and climate variables separately and interactively impact the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Based on long-term monitoring data we quantified the separate and combined impacts of nutrient loading, temperature, salinity, and wind conditions on zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish inhabiting a brackish water ecosystem in the Gulf of Riga. Changes in zoobenthos communities and herring stock were largely explained by climate variables. Zooplankton species were related to both eutrophication and climate variables, and models combining all environmental variables explained additional variation in zooplankton data compared to the separate models of climate and eutrophication. This suggests that zoobenthos communities and herring stock are largely driven by weather conditions, whereas the combined effect of weather and nutrient loads are likely the cause for dynamic zooplankton communities in the Gulf of Riga.

The water samples were collected from different water sources in the region of "Assarel-Medet" Copper Refinery Works. The contents of copper, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and cyanides (mg.dm(-3)) were determined using the method of automatic photometry. The Allium cepa and Pisum sativum plant systems were used for testing of the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of heavy metals and cyanides. A lower mitotic index and a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations were established in all test samples than in the control ones. Chromosome fragments, anaphase and telophase bridges, micronuclei, tagging chromosomes and C-mitotic effect in cells were observed. It was concluded that the pollution found in the regions for production and processing of ore has cytotoxic and genotoxic effect on cells and it could be a potential threat to water ecosystems and human health,

TI Determining site-specific toxicity of copper to daphnids and fishes in a
   brown-water ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY
AB We examined the influence that wetland brown water had on the toxicity of copper to aquatic species in Swamp Creek basin, Wisconsin. Copper was added to Swamp Creek water and to laboratory-prepared reconstituted water and tested for toxicity using daphnids (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Ceriodaphnia reticulata), larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), and larval walleye (Stizostedion vitreum). The toxicities of copper in Swamp Creek water, which contained dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were significantly lower than in water with no DOC. Therefore in successive experiments, using cultured C. dubia as the test organism, we experimentally reduced DOC in Swamp Creek water. We established that increased concentrations of DOC and hardness increased the odds of survival of C. dubia in the presence of potentially lethal concentrations of copper. In the Swamp Creek watershed which contains brown water and in watersheds where DOC concentrations are substantial, DOC, and hardness could be the principal factors in developing site-specific criteria involving copper and perhaps other metals.

TI ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF ADOLESCENTS FROM TWO AMAZONIAN
   ECOSYSTEMS: VARIATIONS ACCORDING TO SEASONALITY
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
AB This paper aims to describe the nutritional status of Caboclo adolescents living in two areas of the Amazon Basin. Two cross-sectional studies, the first in the dry and the second in the wet season, were carried out in two Amazonian ecosystems: the forest and black water ecosystem, and the floodplain and white water ecosystem. Measurements of weight, stature, arm circumference and triceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds were performed on 247 adolescents (10-19 years of age). Nutritional status was classified using body mass index according to international criteria and the prevalence of underweight and overweight was estimated. Linear mixed effects models were used with the anthropometric measurements as dependent variables and time interval, place of residence, sex, age and stature variation as independent variables. During the wet season, the prevalence of overweight among girls was higher in the forest (42%) than in the floodplain (9%). Longitudinal linear regression models showed that the arm circumference measurement was influenced both by seasonality and location, revealing that the increment between dry and wet seasons was less pronounced in the floodplain. At the time of the study, overweight already constituted a major public health concern among girls living in the forest area. In order to develop adequate public health policies for this important segment of the Amazon population further studies are necessary to investigate the role of environment and seasonality on the growth and nutritional status of adolescents.

TI Stream habitat structure influences macroinvertebrate response to
   pesticides
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Agricultural pesticides continue to impair surface water ecosystems, although there are few assessments of interactions with other modifications such as fine sediment and physical alteration for flood drainage. We, therefore, surveyed pesticide contamination and macroinvertebrates in 14 streams along a gradient of expected pesticide exposure using a paired-reach approach to differentiate effects between physically modified and less modified sites. Apparent pesticides effects on the relative abundance of SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) were increased at sites with degraded habitats primarily due to the absence of species with specific preferences for hard substrates. Our findings highlight the importance of physical habitat degradation in the assessment and mitigation of pesticide risk in agricultural streams. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Anthropogenic Activities and the Problem of Antibiotic Resistance in
   Latin America: A Water Issue
SO WATER
AB Antibiotics revolutionized modern medicine and have been an excellent tool to fight infections. However, their overuse and misuse in different human activities such as health care, food production and agriculture has resulted in a global antimicrobial resistance crisis. Some regions such as Latin America present a more complex scenario because of the lack of resources, systematic studies and legislation to control the use of antimicrobials, thus increasing the spread of antibiotic resistance. This review aims to summarize the state of environmental antibiotic resistance in Latin America, focusing on water resources. Three databases were searched to identify publications on antimicrobial resistance and anthropogenic activities in relation to natural and artificial water ecosystems. We found that antibiotic resistant bacteria, mainly against beta lactam antibiotics, have been reported in several Latin American countries, and that resistant bacteria as well as resistant genes can be isolated from a wide variety of aquatic environments, including drinking, surface, irrigation, sea and wastewater. It is urgent to establish policies and regulations for antibiotic use to prevent the increase of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in the environment.

TI Mixture toxicity of thiophanate-methyl and fenvalerate to embryonic
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) and its underlying mechanism
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Though pesticide mixtures can reflect the real-life situation in the water ecosystem, the quantification of their toxicity is still not fully understood. Combined effects of thiophanate-methyl (THM) and fenvalerate (FEN) on embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) and underlying mechanism were conducted in this study. Results showed that the 96-h LC50 values of THM to D. rerio at different growth periods ranged from 12.1 to 26.1 mg L-1, which were lower in comparison with those of FVR ranging from 0.025 to 2.8 mg L-1. Mixture of THM and FVR exhibited a synergetic response to zebrafish embryos. Activities of Cu/Zn-SOD, POD, caspase 3 and caspase 9 were significantly different in most of single and mixture administrations compared with the control group. In addition, live genes (P53, Cu/Zn-sod, crh, ER alpha and IL-8) associated with oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune system and endocrine system showed greater variations of expressions when administrated to pesticide mixtures compared with single chemicals. Our experimental results exhibited that mixtures of thiophanatemethyl and fenvalerate produced higher toxicity towards aqueous vertebrates than when determined singly. Collectively, upcoming environmental risk assessments established according to single administrations might not be enough to protect the water ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING S-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA S
AB Eutrophication process is a serious problem in water ecosystems. There is a great need to study the relation between the physico-chemical condition of water and the influence of these parameters on the diversity of biological life, especially on changes in the structure of microbiocenoses. The most interesting are bacteria and microalgae, due to the important roles they play in maintaining the balance of the aquatic environment. In this study, biodiversity analysis of eukaryotic microalgae and bacteria in two artificial water ecosystems - fish farming ponds - was performed. Aquaculture was based on IMTA technology, in which every part of the trophic chain plays a significant role in maintaining the balance in the ecosystems. Experimental intensive - extensive systems differed in terms of nutrient loads, ponds were characterized by high loads of organic and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. During the experimental period, the physicochemical conditions, quantitative genotypic structure of the two biocenoses being studied and the relation between these factors were monitored and investigated. For the biodiversity analysis, the PCR - DGGE technique was used. The results of preliminary research showed that there is a correlation between nutrient loads, diversity expressed in the Shannon-Wiener Index and the overall condition of experimental systems. Higher loadings of nutrient promote the development of bacteria and microalgae without any influence on the balance in the artificial ecosystem being tested.

TI Entering an era of water scarcity: The challenges ahead
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Fresh water is a renewable resource, but it is also finite. Around the world, there are now numerous signs that human water use exceeds sustainable levels. Groundwater depletion, low or nonexistent river flows, and worsening pollution levels are among the more obvious indicators of water stress. In many areas, extracting more water for human uses jeopardizes the health of vital aquatic ecosystems. Satisfying the increased demands for food, water, and material goods of a growing global population while at the same time protecting the ecological services provided by natural water ecosystems requires new approaches to using and managing fresh water. In this article, I propose a global effort (1) to ensure that freshwater ecosystems receive the quantity, quality, and timing of flows needed for them to perform their ecological functions and (2) to work toward a goal of doubling water productivity. Meeting these challenges will require policies that promote rather than discourage water efficiency, as well as new partnerships that cross disciplinary and professional boundaries.

TI IDENTIFICATION OF URBAN WATER BODIES ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS
AB Aim of the study
   The aim of the research is an analysis of the concept of ecosystem services in context of urban water bodies. In result of the study, final ecosystem services and the goods and benefits of urban aquatic ecosystems were identified.
   Material and methods
   The study of the development of the concept of ecosystem services was based on the literature review. Water ecosystems were analyzed in terms of their ecosystem services that can be assigned to individual classes listed in CICES V5.1. The next step of the analysis was to consider which of the identified ecosystem services of water ecosystems were also provided by urban water bodies. The results of the analysis were divided into biotic and abiotic services in three basic divisions: provisioning, regulation & maintenance, cultural services. Due to the specificity of CICES classification, examples of both, final ecosystem services and ecosystem goods and benefits, were assigned to each class code. The research was conducted in relation to Polish conditions.
   Results and conclusions
   The 26 biotic and 12 abiotic classes of ecosystem services provided by urban water bodies were identified in the analysis. Cultural services of the urban water bodies seem to be the most important for the daily life of city residents. The demand for urban water bodies ecosystems services grows together with increasing social awareness. Social expectations should be reflected in the decisions and actions taken by urban planners and policy makers.

TI Assessing water ecosystem services for water resource management
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Ecosystem service concepts can offer a valuable approach for linking human and nature, and arguments for the conservation and restoration of natural ecosystems. Despite an increasing interest in the topic, the application of these concepts for water resource management has been hampered by the lack of practical definitions and methodologies. In this study we review and analyse the current literature and propose an approach for assessing and valuing ecosystem services in the context of water management. In particular, to study the link between multiple pressures, ecological status and delivery of ecosystem services in aquatic ecosystems under different scenarios of measures or future changes. This is of interest for the development of River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive. We provide a list of proxies/indicators of natural capacity, actual flow and social benefit for the biophysical assessment of the ecosystem services. We advocate the use of indicators of sustainability, combining information on capacity and flow of services. We also suggest methods for economic valuation of aquatic ecosystem for each service and spatial scale of application. We argue that biophysical assessment and economic valuation should be conducted jointly to account for the different values of ecosystem services (ecologic, social and economic) and to strengthen the recognition of human dependency on nature. The proposed approach can be used for assessing the benefits of conservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems in the implementation of the EU water policy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI INSECTS, INSECTICIDES AND HORMESIS: EVIDENCE AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR
   STUDY
SO DOSE-RESPONSE
AB Insects are ubiquitous, crucial components of almost all terrestrial and fresh water ecosystems. In agricultural settings they are subjected to, intentionally or unintentionally, an array of synthetic pesticides and other chemical stressors. These ecological underpinnings, the amenability of insects to laboratory and field experiments, and our strong knowledgebase in insecticide toxicology, make the insect-insecticide model an excellent one to study many questions surrounding hormesis. Moreover, there is practical importance for agriculture with evidence of pest population growth being accelerated by insecticide hormesis. Nevertheless, insects have been underutilized in studies of hormesis. Where hormesis hypotheses have been tested, results clearly demonstrate stimulatory effects on multiple taxa as measured through several biological endpoints, both at individual and population levels. However, many basic questions are outstanding given the myriad of chemicals, responses, and ecological interactions that are likely to occur.

SO ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI
AB To date the studies that link community structure of benthic invertebrates with fish feeding are rare as well as factors that are behind this feeding selectivity are poorly known. In this study, we related invertebrate species composition, their dominance structure and fish biological characteristics to the feeding selectivity and overlap of the native flounder, perch and the invasive round goby in Muuga Bay, the Baltic Sea. Species composition and proportion of benthic invertebrates in the diet of fishes differed from what was available in the field. Except for the round goby, the studied fishes preferred small and mobile invertebrates over large bivalves. However, diet of the studied species, namely the round goby and flounder overlapped. Besides, perch preyed on young stages of the round goby indicating that the introduction of round goby may negatively affect flounder but positively perch.

AB A preliminary optical classification of lakes in Estonia and south Finland which can also be used for small bays of the Baltic Sea is elaborated. The classification is based on the optical properties of water (diffuse attenuation coefficient, diffuse reflectance) and parameters that are routinely monitored in water bodies (Secchi depth, concentration of chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and yellow substance). The data complex used for our classification covers different types of water ecosystems (ranging from oligotrophic to hypertrophic) and the variability of water constituent concentrations in the ice-free period in Estonia and south Finland. Using cluster analysis, we found 5 optical classes of waters: clear (C), moderate (M), turbid (T), very turbid (V) and brown (B). There is satisfactory correspondence between clash of water, shape of diffuse attenuation coefficient and diffuse reflectance spectra and trophic state of the lakes. (C) 2603 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB 1. We grew the submersed freshwater macrophyte Vallisneria americana under controlled conditions at low and high [CO2] to produce litter with high and low tissue nitrogen concentration ([N]), respectively. We then followed mass and nitrogen dynamics in situ in this litter to test the indirect effect of [CO2] on its subsequent decomposition and colonisation by macroinvertebrates.
   2. Litter from plants grown in high CO2 initially lost mass and N at a significantly lower rate but, by day 30, both litter types had lost about 90% of mass and N. Litter [N] did not appear to govern decay rate.
   3. There was no effect of CO2 on the pattern of macroinvertebrate colonisation.
   4. The potential exists for high [CO2] to increase rates of C and N cycling and, thereby, to increase internal N loading in macrophyte-dominated shallow water ecosystems.

AB High densities of Nannochloropsis, reaching up to 5.7 x 10(9) cells per litre, were observed in small inland water bodies in Germany. This is one of the few evidences of a Nannochloropsis species in a freshwater habitat. We describe a new species, N. limnetica Krienitz, Hepperle, Stich ge Weller sp. nov, for which the critical taxonomic characterization is based upon 18S rRNA sequence data. The ultrastructure of this species is characterized by the absence of a plastidial girdle lamella and pyrenoids. The plastid-bounding endoplasmic reticulum is continuous with the nuclear envelope, and the protoplasm contains numerous rodlike, doubly refringent lamellate vesicles. The pigment content of N. limnetica corresponds to that of other Nannochloropsis, but echinone was also found. The fatty acid composition of N. limnetica is similar to that of marine species; however, the total amount of fatty acids (351 mu g mg(-1) C-1) is higher than in marine species.

AB The article explores the peculiarities of water quality formation at the Amur River transboundary area under the influence of sulfate reduction processes taking place within bottom sediments. Below the Songhua River mouth, the Amur water quality is affected by the flow of this right-bank tributary (Heilongjiang province) and municipal wastewaters discharged from the Chinese city of Fuyuan. To prediction the contamination of bottom waters with toxic hydrogen sulfide, we suggest using the coefficient of ecological risk of formation of local hydrogen sulfide zones. The coefficient is calculated by determining the quantitative relation between two bacteriobenthos groups (sulfate reducing/ammonifying bacteria). This coefficient makes it possible to determine the intensity of toxic H2S formation in the water-bottom contact area during water ecosystem eutrophication.

This paper presents results of the analytical study of the lake water composition and compares this with relevant data from earlier years. The impact of the following factors was distinguished and discussed: atmospheric deposition (dry and wet), migration of pollutants with runoff water supplying both reservoirs, tourism (hiking, climbing), and the influence of mountain hostels. The resistance and sensitivity of the lakes to human impact is described in terms of water quality changes and characteristics of the catchments and the region.

AB Tropical water-terrestrial ecotones play important roles in regulating the flow of materials from and to land and water ecosystems. Ecotones exist where active interactions between two or more adjacent ecosystems occur with the appearance of processes that do not exist in either of the adjacent ecosystems. They occur naturally depending on the hydrological and geomorphological structure of the location. External and internal processes can influence the origin and persistence of ecotones. Ecotones regulate the landscape mosaic, affect energy flow between adjacent systems and intervene in landscape connectivity.
   The literature on geological and climatic origins of wetlands and open waters, internal influences on their creation and destruction and, finally, their use by society is reviewed.

TI Modeling the Biotic Energy Flow in the Plankton Community of the Lake
   Type Ecosystem with the Involvement of Microorganisms
SO INLAND WATER BIOLOGY
AB A mass-balance model simulating a biotic energy flow in the plankton community with the participation of microbial organisms has been designed for a lake-type ecosystem. The input abiotic parameters of the model are latitude, mean depth, water color, and total phosphorus content in water. The model was constructed on the basis of the data published for the Rybinsk Reservoir and Mongolian lakes. An analysis of the model indicated that the addition of the microbial loop to the traditional linear trophic chain resulted in a twofold decrease in the biomass and production of metazoan plankton and planktivorous fish. The value of the final ecosystem production (fish production) is suggested to be closely associated with the degree of development of the microbial loop during the growing season.

AB Zooplankton is an important component in the water ecosystem and food chain. To understand the influence of zooplankton on the ecosystem a data collection is necessary. In research the automatic image based recognition of zooplankton is of growing interest. Several systems have been developed for zooplankton recognition on low resolution images. For large images approaches are seldom. Images of this size easily exceed the main memory of standard computers. Our novel automatic segmentation approach is able to handle these large images. We developed a contour based Split & Merge approach for segmentation and, to reduce the non-zooplankton segments, combine it with a pre-classification of the segments in reference to their shape. The latter includes a detection of quasi round segments and a novel one for thin segments. Experimental results on several large images show that we are able to handle them satisfactorily.

Taking small watershed as a unit of assessment, we select population density, urbanization intensity, temperature, precipitation, and humidity and vegetation coverage to construct the fluctuating zone wetland ecosystem assessment index system. The comprehensive health index is calculated after extracting the main information of the six variables using principal component analysis. It is ranged into three levels: good, medium and poor. The results show that the health state of the entire Three Gorges area is at medium and poor levels. Regions at medium health state account for 58% of the entire area, and the remaining regions are at poor health. Taking Wanzhou District as the boundary, the health state of the southwest region is better than the northeast region.

TI Trophic effects of sponge feeding within Lake Baikal's littoral zone .2.
   Sponge abundance, diet, feeding efficiency, and carbon flux
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Endemic freshwater demosponges in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal, Russia, dominate the benthic biomass, covering 44% of the benthos. We measured in situ sponge abundance and,orating and calculated sponge-mediated Fluxes of picoplankton (plankton <2 mu m) for two common species, Baikalospongia intermedia and Baikalospongia bacillifera. By means of dual-beam how cytometry, we found retention efficiencies ranging from 58 to 99% for four types of picoplankton: heterotrophic bacteria, Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria, autotrophic picoplankton with one chloroplast, and autotrophic picoplankton with two chloroplasts. By using a general model for organism-mediated fluxes, we conservatively estimate that through active suspension feeding, sponges are a sink for 1.97 g C d(-1) m(-1), mostly from procaryotic cell types. Furthermore, grazing by these extensive sponge communities can create a layer of picoplankton-depleted water overlying the benthic community in this unique lake.

SO EXPERIENTIA
AB The goal of this article is twofold: 1) It aims at providing an overview on some major results obtained from energy flow studies in individuals, populations, and communities, and 2) it will also focus on major mechanisms explaining community structures. The basis for any biological community to survive and establish a certain population density is on the one hand energy fixation by primary producers together with adequate nutrient supply and the transfer of energy between trophic levels ('bottom-up effect'). On the other hand, predator pressures may strongly control prey population densities one or more trophic levels below ('top-down effect'). Other interpopulation effects include competition, chemical interactions and evolutionary genetic processes, which further interact and result in the specific structuring of any community with respect to species composition and population sizes.

TI Impacts of high-quality coal mine drainage recycling for replenishment
   of aquatic ecosystems in arid regions of China: Bacterial community
   responses
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Coal mine water is usually recycled as supplementary water for aquatic ecosystems in arid and semiarid mining regions of China. To ensure ecosystem health, the coal mine water is rigorously treated using several processes, including reverse osmosis, to meet surface water quality standards. However, the potential environmental impacts of this management pattern on the ecological function of receiving water bodies are unclear. In this study, we built several microcosm water ecosystems to simulate the receiving water bodies. High-quality treated coal mine drainage was mixed into the model water bodies at different concentrations, and the sediment bacterial community response and functional changes were systematically investigated. The results showed that the highquality coal mine drainage could still shape bacterial taxonomic diversity, community composition and structure, with a concentration threshold of approximately 50%. Moreover, both the Mantel test and the structural equation model indicated that the salinity fluctuation caused by the receiving of coal mine drainage was the primary factor shaping the bacterial communities. 10 core taxa in the molecular ecological network influenced by coal mine drainage were identified, with the most critical taxa being patescibacteria and g_Geothermobacter. Furthermore, the pathway of carbohydrate metabolism as well as signaling molecules and interactions was upregulated, whereas amino acid metabolism showed the opposite trend. All results suggested that the complex physical-chemical and biochemical processes in water ecosystems may be affected by the coal mine drainage. The bacterial community response and underlying functional changes may accelerate internal nutrient cycling, which may have a potential impact on algal bloom outbreaks.

TI Biodiversity conservation in Mediterranean and Black Sea lagoons: a
   trait-oriented approach to benthic invertebrate guilds
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. The extent to which conservation of biodiversity enforces the protection of ecosystem functioning. goods and services is a key issue in conservation ecology.
   2. In order to address this conservation issue. this work focused on community organization, linking community structure, as described both in taxonomic and functional terms, to community functioning and ecosystem process.
   3. Body size is an individual functional trait that is deterministically related to components of ecosystem functioning such as population dynamics and energy flow, and which determines components of community structure. Since body size is an individual trait that reflects numerous factors, it is also exposed to trait selection and the niche filtering underlying the community.
   4. An analysis of the relevance of body size to community organization in transitional water ecosystems in the eastern Mediterranean adn Black Sea regions is presented, based on field research conducted on a sample of 15 transitional water ecosystems.
   5. 250 taxa were identified, clumped in five orders of magnitude of body size. All bodt size patterns showed triangular distributions with an optimal size range of 0.13 mg to 1.0 mg individual body mass.
   6. Deterministic components of size structure were emphasized and a hierarchical organization with dominance of large sizes was demonstrated by the slopes of the body size-abundance distributions, consistently larger than the EER threshold (b=-0.75), and by the direct relationship of energy use to body size for most of the body size range.
   7. Consistent variations of body size-related descriptors were observed on three main gradients of environmental stress; cultrophication, cofinement and metal pollution.
   8. The results support the relevance of constraints imposed by individual body size on community organization in transitional water ecosystems and the adequacy of size patterns as an indicator for ecological conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Organic halogens in the environment: studies of environmental
   biodegradability and human exposure
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB Organic halogens from chlorobleaching of kraft pulp were not as biorecalcitrant as has been assumed. Fifty percent were removed during biotreatment of wastewater, and 50% of the remaining organohalogens faded in fresh water ecosystems in 200 to 400 days. Molecular size seemed not to hinder biodegradation up to sizes of approximately 2000 daltons. Anoxic biodegradation was of prime importance for halomineralization of pulp bleaching organohalogens but could also lead to toxic metabolites such as vinyl chloride from tri- and tetrachloroethene in anoxic soil. Indigenous soil microbes were unable to clean old organohalogen pollution but had converted chlorophenols into polymeric substances, chlorohumus, which were found bioaccumulable by earthworms in spite of the large (up to 5000 g/mole) molecular sizes. Because of the danger of formation of toxic metabolites, the biochemistry of the xenobiotic degradation must be elucidated before active bioremediation is practiced on polluted soil or water. Groundwater pollution by chlorophenols led to increased disease among the exposed population in one well-studied case. Two further cases of potential environmental health impact are described.

TI Multidimensional Assessment of Lake Water Ecosystem Services Using
   Remote Sensing
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Freshwater is becoming scarce worldwide with the rapidly growing population, developing industries, burgeoning agriculture, and increasing consumption. Assessment of ecosystem services has been regarded as a promising way to reconcile the increasing demand and depleting natural resources. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional assessment framework for evaluating water provisioning ecosystem services by integrating multi-source remote sensing products. We applied the multidimensional framework to assess lake water ecosystem services in the state of Minnesota, US. We found that: (1) the water provisioning ecosystem services degraded during 1998-2018 from three assessment perspectives; (2) the output, efficiency, and trend indices have stable distribution and various spatial clustering patterns from 1998 to 2018; (3) high-level efficiency depends on high-level output, and low-level output relates to low-level efficiency; (4) Western Minnesota, including Northwest, West Central, and Southwest, degraded more severely than other zones in water provisioning services; (5) human activities impact water provisioning services in Minnesota more than climate changes. These findings can benefit policymakers by identifying the priorities for better protection, conservation, and restoration of lake ecosystems. Our multidimensional assessment framework can be adapted to evaluate ecosystem services in other regions.

TI Predicting lake dissolved organic carbon at a global scale
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), is one of the main regulators of the ecology and biogeochemistry of inland water ecosystems, and an important loss term in the carbon budgets of land ecosystems. We used a novel machine learning technique and global databases to test if and how different environmental factors contribute to the variability of in situ DOC concentrations in lakes. In order to estimate DOC in lakes globally we predicted DOC in each lake with a surface area larger than 0.1 km(2). Catchment properties and meteorological and hydrological features explained most of the variability of the lake DOC concentration, whereas lake morphometry played only a marginal role. The predicted average of the global DOC concentration in lake water was 3.88 mg L-1. The global predicted pool of DOC in lake water was 729 Tg from which 421 Tg was the share of the Caspian Sea. The results provide global-scale evidence for ecological, climate and carbon cycle models of lake ecosystems and related future prognoses.

TI Monsoonal forcing of cold-water coral growth off southeastern Brazil
   during the past 160 kyr
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB Cold-water corals (CWCs) constitute important deep-water ecosystems that are under increasing environmental pressure due to ocean acidification and global warming. The sensitivity of these deep-water ecosystems to environmental change is demonstrated by abundant paleorecords drilled through CWC mounds that reveal characteristic alterations between rapid formation and dormant or erosive phases. Previous studies have identified several central parameters for driving or inhibiting CWC growth such as food supply, oxygenation, and the carbon saturation state of bottom water, yet there are still large uncertainties about the relative importance of the different environmental parameters. To advance this debate we have performed a multiproxy study on a sediment core retrieved from the 25 m high Bowie Mound, located at 866 m water depth on the continental slope off southeastern Brazil, a structure built up mainly by the CWC Solenosmilia variabilis. Our results indicate a multifactorial control on CWC growth at Bowie Mound during the past similar to 160 kyr, which reveals distinct formation pulses during northern high-latitude glacial cold events (Heinrich stadials, HSs) largely associated with anomalously strong monsoonal rainfall over the continent. The ensuing enhanced runoff elevated the terrigenous nutrient and organic-matter supply to the continental margin and likely boosted marine productivity. The dispersal of food particles towards the CWC colonies during HSs was facilitated by the highly dynamic hydraulic conditions along the continental slope that prevailed throughout glacial periods. These conditions caused the emplacement of a pronounced nepheloid layer above Bowie Mound, thereby aiding the concentration and along-slope dispersal of organic matter. Our study thus emphasizes the impact of continental climate variability on a highly vulnerable deep-marine ecosystem.

TI The roles of phytohormones in metal stress regulation in microalgae
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB The constant spread of heavy metal contamination creates an increasing global environmental issue that results in considerable deterioration of land and water ecosystems leading to a decline in the health of plants, animals and humans. Novel, algal-based filtration technologies have been gaining a great deal of attention given their eco-friendly, effective and easy to implement processes. This review focuses on the potential roles that phytohormones can play in heavy metal stress response in microalgae. It emphasizes phytohormone efficiency and proposes the use of these signaling molecules for enhanced metal stress alleviation in microalgae. Furthermore, future implications for algal-based filtration technologies involving modifications of phytohormone metabolism towards improved heavy metal biodegradation rates are presented.

TI Occurrence and ecotoxicity of selected artificial sweeteners in the Brno
   city waste water
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focused on the appearance of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners (acesulfame K, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose) in waste and discharged water and the evaluation of their possible negative effects on the water ecosystem. Samples of raw and treated wastewater were collected at the inflow and outflow of the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Brno-Modrice (Czech Republic). The target compounds were isolated by solid phase extraction and determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The ecotoxicity of target compounds expressed as the ErC20, LC20, and EC20 values was evaluated by a battery of tests using representatives of producers and consumers in the water ecosystem as testing organisms (Lemna minor, Thamnocephalus platyurus, and Daphnia magna). The results proved that the acute toxicity of individual artificial sweeteners does not pose a significant risk to the aquatic ecosystem. The compound showing the highest concentration in raw wastewater (in the range of tens of mu g L-1) and negligible removal during the wastewater treatment process was sucralose, but its ecotoxicity was the lowest of the ASs studied. The highest ecotoxicity showed saccharin, but its removal in a wastewater treatment plant was almost complete. However, additional studies are needed to evaluate the chronic toxicity of ASs and also possible synergistic or antagonistic effects in ASs mixtures.

TI Sorbent Based on Polyvinyl Butyral and Potassium Polytitanate for
   Purifying Wastewater from Heavy Metal Ions
SO PROCESSES
AB Currently, the rapid development of industry leads to an increase in negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment, including water ecosystems. This circumstance entails toughening environmental standards and, in particular, requirements for the content of pollutants in wastewater. As a result, developing technical and cost-effective ways for wastewater purification becomes relevant. This study is devoted to the development of a novel composite sorbent, based on polyvinyl butyral and potassium polytitanate, designed to purify water from heavy metal ions. The co-deposition of a mixture based on a polymer solution and a filler suspension was used to obtain a composite material. In this work, the influence of the deposition conditions on the structure and properties of the resulting composites was studied, as well as the optimal ratio of components, including solvent, precipitant, polymer binder, and filler, were established. In the course of this study on the sorption properties of the developed composite materials using various sorption models, the sorption capacity of the obtained material, the sorption mechanism, and the limiting stage of the sorption process were determined. The developed sorbent can be suitably used in the wastewater treatment systems of galvanic industries, enterprises producing chemical current sources, and in other areas.

TI Southern South Australian groundwater microbe diversity
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Groundwater is increasingly used globally for domestic, industrial and agricultural production. While many studies have focused on groundwater as a resource, the diverse ecosystems within are often ignored. Here, we assess 54 Southern South Australian groundwater microbial communities from the populated part of the state to assess their status and dynamics in isolated groundwater systems. We observed a strong site-to-site individuality in groundwater bacterial communities, likely due to the isolated nature of groundwater bodies leading to unique ecosystems. Rank abundance analysis indicates bacterial diversity is maintained even at low abundances and that the distribution fits classical ecological models for strong competition in resource-limited environments. Combined, our data indicates that despite overrepresentation of pollutant-associated bacterial orders in and around the Adelaide metropolitan area, microbial communities remain diverse and show little evidence of converging on a common pollutant-effected community.

TI The effects of climatic fluctuations and extreme events on running water
   ecosystems
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Most research on the effects of environmental change in freshwaters has focused on incremental changes in average conditions, rather than fluctuations or extreme events such as heatwaves, cold snaps, droughts, floods or wildfires, which may have even more profound consequences. Such events are commonly predicted to increase in frequency, intensity and duration with global climate change, with many systems being exposed to conditions with no recent historical precedent. We propose a mechanistic framework for predicting potential impacts of environmental fluctuations on running-water ecosystems by scaling up effects of fluctuations from individuals to entire ecosystems. This framework requires integration of four key components: effects of the environment on individual metabolism, metabolic and biomechanical constraints on fluctuating species interactions, assembly dynamics of local food webs, and mapping the dynamics of the meta-community onto ecosystem function. We illustrate the framework by developing a mathematical model of environmental fluctuations on dynamically assembling food webs. We highlight (currently limited) empirical evidence for emerging insights and theoretical predictions. For example, widely supported predictions about the effects of environmental fluctuations are: high vulnerability of species with high per capita metabolic demands such as large-bodied ones at the top of food webs; simplification of food web network structure and impaired energetic transfer efficiency; and reduced resilience and top-down relative to bottom-up regulation of food web and ecosystem processes. We conclude by identifying key questions and challenges that need to be addressed to develop more accurate and predictive bio-assessments of the effects of fluctuations, and implications of fluctuations for management practices in an increasingly uncertain world.

TI Objectives and Indexes for Implementation of Sponge CitiesA Case Study
   of Changzhou City, China
SO WATER
AB This paper presents a framework of objectives and indexes for sponge cities implementation in China. The proposed objectives and indexes aims to reflect whether the city is in accord with the sponge city. Different cities have different objectives and indexes as each city has its own geologic and hydrogeological conditions. Therefore, the main problems (e.g., water security and flood risks) in the central urban area of Changzhou city, China were evaluated scientifically. According to the local conditions, four objectives and eleven indexes have been made as a standard to estimate the sponge city and set a goal for the city development to reach the goal of sustainable urban development. The strategy of process control was implemented to improve the standard of urban drainage and flood control facilities, regulate total runoff and reduce storm peak flow, and the ecological monitoring of the function of the rivers and lakes. The objectives of sponge cities include water security, water quality improvement, healthy water ecosystems, and water utilization efficiency. Urban flood prevention capacity, river and lake water quality compliance, and annual runoff control are the key objectives to encourage the use of non-conventional water resources.

TI Functional diversity in three Mediterranean transitional water
   ecosystems
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Biological trait analysis (BTA) is a method that describes ecological functioning of species assemblages incorporating information on species' distributions and their biological characteristics. In the present study, soft bottom communities of three Mediterranean coastal lagoons with different degree of salinity range were analyzed for seven biological traits (mobility, habitat, feeding type, habitat modification, body form, body size and feeding apparatus) in order to investigate the differences in communities' structure and functional diversity across a scale of natural stress. In more variable environments semi-mobile and epibenthic organisms prevailed, while predators were found under more stable conditions. Multivariate analyses using biological traits gave similar results with those obtained by the traditional analyses using species abundances; however, the distinction among lagoons was less evident, indicating that in transitional waters species can be different but their biological traits similar. This supports the idea of species redundancy in transitional water ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Long-Term Exposure to Azo Dyes from Textile Wastewater Causes the
   Abundance of Saccharibacteria Population
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Discharge of untreated wastewater is one of the major problems in various countries. The use of azo dyes in textile industries are one of the key xenobiotic compounds which effect both soil and water ecosystems and result in drastic effect on the microbial communities. Orathupalayam dam, which is constructed over Noyyal river in Tamil Nadu, India has become a sink of wastewater from the nearby textile industries. The present study had aimed to characterize the bacterial diversity and community profiles of soil collected from the vicinity of the dam (DS) and allied agricultural field (ALS) nearby the catchment area. The soil dehydrogenase and cellulase activities were significantly lower in DS compared to ALS. Additionally, the long-term exposure to azo dye compounds resulted in higher relative abundance of Saccharibacteria (36.4%) which are important for degradation of azo dyes. On the other hand, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (25.4%) were higher in ALS. Interestingly, the abundance of Saccharibacteria (15.2%) were also prominent in ALS suggesting that the azo compounds might have deposited in the agricultural field through irrigation. Hence, this study revealed the potential bacterial phyla which can be key drivers for designing viable technologies for degradation of xenobiotic dyes.

Results show that: (i) the distribution of macrobenthic assemblages was roughly determined by the vegetation as major structuring factor and by sediment, pH and dissolved oxygen; (ii) the overall faunal composition, species distribution and community structure in the Smir lagoon were comparable to those reported for other Moroccan brackish ecosystems (iii) the trophic structure was exclusively dominated by detritivores and (iv), the lagoon was a slightly disturbed ecosystem with unbalanced communities.

TI Conventional armament wastes induce micronuclei in wild brown trout
   Salmo trutta
SO MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
AB We analysed micronuclei in brown trout Salmo trutta specimens sampled in the Trubia River, upstream and downstream of the emissions from a Spanish military factory to assess genotoxicity risks derived from military wastes. A significant exponential increase in micronuclei counts was found in fish living downstream of the military wastes with respect to fishes inhabiting upstream areas of the same river. In comparison, we only found a Linear increase in micronuclei counts in a control stream where an old military factory had been demolished 6 months before sampling. This difference suggests that active discharge of armament factory wastes can directly induce micronuclei and therefore represents a genotoxic risk for the ecosystem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Commons, communities and commodification: a review of reforms in land,
   water and local democracy in Kerala, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY
AB As India is releasing its third National Water Policy in the last 20 years, this paper seeks to review the earlier policies relevant to a critical yet under-studied surface water ecosystem of rural community ponds. The paper examines how the notion of commodification informed the policies on water, land and local democracy, impacting the governance of rural community ponds in the state of Kerala, India. The review shows that while earlier country-level policies largely showed a tendency to treat water as a commodity, decommodification tendencies are perceptible in the water policy of Kerala. Nonetheless, the land reforms in Kerala resulted in Dalit Bahujans being systematically excluded from accessing land, even though it ended the operation of commoditised human bodies, and enforced land ceilings. Huge tracts of plantations were kept out of the purview of land reforms, signifying the operation of commodification. A positive aspect of the land ceilings was that many private enclosures like rural ponds were transferred to the state. The reforms in local democracy, to a great extent, led to accessible policy-making. The framework of 'double movement' is useful in analysing the trends in environmental sociology and evaluating policies related to socio-ecological systems.

TI Macroecology of fish community biomass - size structure: effects of
   invasive species and river regulation
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB The biomass of organisms of different sizes is increasingly being used to explore macroscale variation in food-web and community structure. Here we examine how invasive species and river flow regulation affect native fish biomass and fish community log(10) biomass - body mass scaling relationships in Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling. The log(10) biomass - body mass scaling exponent (scaling B) of invasive fishes (95% CI: -0.14 to -0.18) was less negative than for native fishes (95% CI: -0.20 to -0.25), meaning that invasive species attained a higher biomass in larger size-classes compared to native species. Flow alteration and invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio) biomass were correlated with severe reductions in native fish biomass ranging from -47% to -68% (95% CI). Our study provides novel evidence suggesting that invasive and native communities have different biomass - body mass scaling patterns, which likely depend on differences in their trophic ecology and body size distributions. Our results suggest that restoration efforts using environmental flows and common carp control has potential to boost native fish biomass to more than double the current level.

TI Drought-driven lake level decline: effects on coarse woody habitat and
   fishes
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Research testing for the effects of climate change on lentic fishes has focused on changing thermal and dissolved oxygen regimes, but has often overlooked potential influences of altered lake levels on littoral habitat availability and species interactions. Natural littoral structures such as coarse woody habitat (CWH) can be critical to fishes for prey production, refuge, and spawning. Drought-driven lake level declines may strand these structures above the waterline and thereby remove them from littoral zones. A prolonged drought in northern Wisconsin, USA, allowed us to test for effects of lake level decline on CWH and the response of a fish community. During our study (2001-2009), the lake level of Little Rock Lake South declined over 1.1 m and >75% of the previously submerged CWH was lost from the littoral zone. The loss of CWH coincided with the forage fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens) falling below detection and reduced growth of the top piscivore (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides). Our study highlights the importance of lake level fluctuations as a mechanism by which climate change may affect aquatic ecosystems and species interactions.

TI Occurrence of viable photoautotrophic picoplankton in the aphotic zone
   of Lake Biwa, Japan
SO JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
AB The distribution and abundance of photoautotrophic picoplankton (PPP, Synechococcus group) in the aphotic bottom sediments of Lake Biwa were investigated by direct counting and viable counting (most probable number, MPN) methods. In the surface layer of bottom sediments (0-1 cm), where large PPP blooms occurred in the past 5 years, >10(5) cells cm(-3) of PPP were found to be viable throughout the year. Furthermore, the density of PPP deposited on the sediment surface (0-0.1 cm) was one order of magnitude higher (MPN = 1.3 x 10(6) cells cm(-3), direct count = 9.9 x 10(6) cells cm(-3)) than that of bulked surface sediments (0-1 cm). Even in the deeper layer (13-14 cm) of bottom mud, viable PPP were still found (10(1) cells cm(-3)). In winter, viable PPP in the aphotic bottom sediments were 10(4)-10(5) times greater per unit volume than those in the euphotic lake water. Since the aphotic bottom sediments have high levels of PPP, as well as high growth potential (high ratio of viable count/total direct count), they are likely to seed PPP blooms in the North Basin of Lake Biwa.

TI POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF AUTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON IN RELATION TO
   ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS IN A PRODUCTIVE LAKE
SO AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Spatial and seasonal fluctuations in autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance in a eutrophic, dimictic lake (Lake Aydat, France) were measured concurrently with a variety of environmental variables. Cell number ranged from 0.03 to 2.36x10(6) cells . ml(-1) (highest concentrations were > 5-fold higher than in oligotrophic lakes) and averaged 24 +/- 7% of total picoplankton abundance (APP + heterotrophic bacteria). APP abundance (1) peaked in spring simultaneously with heterotrophic flagellate and ciliate densities, (2) decreased during the nitrogen-limited and summer stratification period, and (3) increased with fall turnover. In summer-autumn, the contribution of single-cell eukaryotic (up to 66%) and colonial prokaryotic (18%) forms to total abundance peaked in the bottom waters. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that > 40% variance in APP number changes may be explained by ciliate abundance (at 0-4 m depth-range), heterotrophic flagellate number and oxygen concentration (5-9 m), and ciliate carbon biomass (10-14 m). The model accounting for changes in heterotrophic bacterial abundance (5-9 m) indicates chlorophyll a concentration (r(2)=58%) and ciliate abundance (r(2)=34%) as dominant covariates. The data presented here suggest that micrograzers control APP abundance in Lake Aydat.

   WATER SHREW, NEOMYS-FODIENS (SORICIDAE, INSECTIVORA)
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB A comparative study of a stream macroinvertebrate community and the diet of one of its predators, the water shrew (Neomys fodiens), was undertaken during a period of one year. Quantitative sampling of the benthic community and faecal analysis were performed. Due to the highly contagious distribution of the invertebrates in the river, Mantel tests were used for the statistical analysis. The diet of N. fodiens depended, partially, on the type of environment exploited, an observation also drawn from comparison with other studies. The major part (min. 80%) was taken in the river. Seasonal variations were detected in the benthic populations of the river, as well as in the water shrew's diet. The diet of N. fodiens was significantly correlated with the density of stream invertebrates, ie. the water shrew was rather opportunist and choose its prey according to their abundance. Food was plentiful all year round and lack of food could not have been the cause of the winter decline in the water shrew population. The secondary production of the river was estimated and compared to the water shrew's energy requirement.

TI Research on Value Evaluation and Impact Mechanism of Water Ecological
   Services in Mountainous Cities: A Case Study of Xiangxi Prefecture
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB To have a more comprehensive understanding of the water ecological services of Xiangxi, the index system of water ecological service is constructed and the intensity of its influencing factors founded on the geographic detector model (GDM) is obtained in this paper. Then, the water ecological service index of eight cities in Xiangxi to evaluate the function level is determined. It is proved that: (a) The overall service value of water cultural function as a key factor in the construction of water ecological services, soil conservation value, and water supply value are relatively poor. (b) The value of the water ecological culture function type is the largest, with an overall value of 353.32 billion yuan. The value of water resources supply is the smallest, with a value of only 4.37 billion yuan, which indicates that human activities have a strong interference with the service function of the water ecosystem. (c) Based on GDM, four factors, including precipitation, resident population, sewage discharge, and water quality compliance rate, have a significant impact on water ecological services. Among them, per capita GDP(X7) > vegetation coverage (X6) > precipitation (X2) > resident population (X4), which further clearly explains the impact intensity of mountain climate basic conditions and human socio-economic activities on water ecological services. The results can offer a practical basis for the spatial development and protection of the water ecosystem to coordinate humans and the environment.

TI Strong variation in sedimental antibiotic resistomes among urban rivers,
   estuaries and coastal oceans: Evidence from a river-connected coastal
   water ecosystem in northern China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Sediment is thought to be a vital reservoir to spread antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among various natural environments. However, the spatial distribution patterns of the sedimental antibiotic resistomes around the Bohai Bay region, a river-connected coastal water ecosystem, are still poorly understood. The present study conducted a comprehensive investigation of ARGs among urban rivers (UR), estuaries (ES) and Bohai Bay (BHB) by metagenomic sequencing. Overall, a total of 169 unique ARGs conferring resistance to 15 antimicrobial classes were detected across all sediment samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the UR were all significantly higher than those in the ES and BHB (p < 0.05 andp < 0.01), revealing the distance dilution of the sedimental resistomes from the river to the ocean. Multidrug resistance genes contained most of the ARG subtypes, whereas rifamycin resistance genes were the most abundant ARGs in this region. Our study demonstrated that most antimicrobial resistomes were highly accumulated in urban river sediments, whereas beta-lactamase resistance genes (mainly PNGM-1) dramatically increased away from the estuary to the open ocean. The relative abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) also gradually decreased from rivers to the coastal ocean, whereas the difference in pathogenic bacteria was not significant in the three classifications. Among MGEs, plasmids were recognized as the most important carriers to support the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs within and between species. According to co-occurrence networks, pathogenic Proteo-bacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were recognized as potential and important hosts of ARGs. Heavy metals, pH and moisture content were all recognized as the vital environmental factors influencing the distri-bution of ARGs in sediment samples. Overall, the present study may help to understand the distribution patterns of ARGs at a watershed scale, and help to make effective policies to control the emergence, spread and evolution of different ARG subtypes in different habitats.

AB Successful river water quality modelling requires the specification of an appropriate model structure and process formulation. Both must be related to the compartment structure of running water ecosystems including their longitudinal, vertical, and lateral zonation patterns. Furthermore, the temporal variability of abiotic boundary conditions may be important and must be incorporated by an appropriate choice of model parameters. A six-step decision procedure is proposed to achieve these objectives. The steps address the determination of the following model features: (1) temporal representation (dynamic or steady-state); (2) model dimensionality; (3) mixing; (4) advection; (5) reaction terms; and (6) boundary conditions. Numerical criteria based on process time constants and length scales provide a basis for these decisions.

AB In the water ecosystem conversion of organic matter can occur due to various biochemical processes of oxidation, hydroxylation and methylation. Also these may be co-factors which influence on mechanisms of migration and accumulation certain elements in contact zones of water ecosystems (water - suspension particle, water - bottom, water - ice). Researches of ice of the Amur River spent within 2002-2012. It has been installed, that in ices various organic substances and toxic elements accumulate. Thus they are exposed to microbiological transformation. After technogenic accident in Jilin province (China) in November 2005 about 100 tonnes of toxic substances including nitrobenzene, benzene, aniline, chorine-containing substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other volatile compounds came into the Songhua River. The presence of methylated derivatives of benzene in ice may be the result of: firstly, the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in sewage and waste waters which pollute the river during the ice formation; secondly, biogeochemical processes, which occur in bottom sediments and in the ice mass in winter time. The highest concentrations of methylene chloride and mercury were found in freeze up 2010-2011 in the same ice sample collected from Amur River near to the Khabarovsk city. We carried out the correlation analysis to identify the connecting between methylene chloride and mercury contents. Methylated mercury accumulated in the ice can come into the water of Amur estuary during the ice break-up. Therefore the pollution of the rivers in freeze-up (an ice cover formation) it is possible to observe consequences later 5-6 months (prolonged ecological risk). The layer-by-layer chemical and microbiological analysis of ice, contaminated with organic compounds, may be use to predict secondary pollution of river water with toxic substances during ice melting, as well as to assess ecological risks for hydrobionts of various trophic level.

TI Perspectives on the antibiotic contamination, resistance, metabolomics,

SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Antibiotics have been regarded as the emerging contaminants because of their massive use in humans and veterinary medicines and their persistence in the environment. The global concern of antibiotic contamination to different environmental matrices and the emergence of antibiotic resistance has posed a severe impact on the environment. Different mass-spectrometry-based techniques confirm their presence in the environment. Antibiotics are released into the environment through the wastewater steams and runoff from land application of manure. The microorganisms get exposed to the antibiotics resulting in the development of antimicrobial resistance. Consistent release of the antibiotics, even in trace amount into the soil and water ecosystem, is the major concern because the antibiotics can lead to multi-resistance in bacteria which can cause hazardous effects on agriculture, aquaculture, human, and livestock. A better understanding of the correlation between the antibiotic use and occurrence of antibiotic resistance can help in the development of policies to promote the judicious use of antibiotics. The present review puts a light on the remediation, transportation, uptake, and antibiotic resistance in the environment along with a novel approach of creating a database for systemic remediation, and metabolomics for the cleaner and safer environment.

TI The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) in shallow-marine
   successions of the Adriatic carbonate platform (SW Slovenia)
SO GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
AB The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum represents one of the most rapid and extreme warming events in the Cenozoic. Shallow-water stratigraphic sections from the Adriatic carbonate platform offer a rare opportunity to learn about the nature of Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum and the effects on shallow-water ecosystems. We use carbon and oxygen isotope stratigraphy, in conjunction with detailed larger benthic foraminiferal biostratigraphy, to establish a high-resolution paleoclimatic record for the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. A prominent negative excursion in delta C-13 curves of bulk-rock (similar to 1 parts per thousand-3 parts per thousand), matrix (similar to 4 parts per thousand), and foraminifera (similar to 6 parts per thousand) is interpreted as the carbon isotope excursion during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The strongly C-13-depleted delta(1)d(3)C record of our shallow-marine carbonates compared to open-marine records could result from organic matter oxidation, suggesting intensified weathering, runoff, and organic matter flux.
   The Ilerdian larger benthie foraminiferal turnover is documented in detail based on high-resolution correlation with the carbon isotopic excursion. The turnover is described as a two-step process, with the first step (early Ilerdian) marked by a rapid diversification of small alveolinids and nummulitids with weak adult dimorphism, possibly as adaptations to fluctuating Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum nutrient levels, and a second step (middle Ilerdian) characterized by a further specific diversification, increase of shell size, and well-developed adult dimorphism. Within an evolutionary scheme controlled by long-term biological processes, we argue that high seawater temperatures could have stimulated the early Ilerdian rapid specific diversification. Together, these data help elucidate the effects of global warming and associated feedbacks in shallow-water ecosystems, and by inference, could serve as an assessment analog for future changes.

TI Short time dissolved oxygen dynamics in shallow water ecosystems
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Dissolved oxygen evolution over time holds information about the recent and past history of the physics, the chemistry and the biology of aquatic systems. On the daily time scale various phenomena seem to repeat with a sort of regularity, leaving a trace in the further trend of oxygen dynamics. These are the wind calm of nocturnal and early morning hours, the advent of the afternoon breezes, the micro- and macro-algae diurnal production, the chemical and biochemical processes. On the larger seasonal scale, dissolved oxygen shows an almost periodical trend. In this case, a greater dependency on the climatic events leads to the colder and windy season, while the warm and hot period is closely related to the vegetable production, which frees remarkable amounts of oxygen in the water through photosynthesis. Result of experimental measurements of dissolved oxygen, acquired with an automatic equipment on a very short time scale (30 s), are shown and discussed. The experiments were run to detect oscillating phenomena characterized by a period which is shorter than the daily occurrence, as well as stochastic phenomena, led by almost periodical drifts, which contribute substantially to the oxygen dynamics on the longer time scale. To determine these pseudo-periodicities, or time variation for the oscillation period, the analysis of the temporal distances between local maxima of oxygen concentrations has been performed. This kind of analysis is based on the hypothesis that we are dealing with a dissipative dynamical system whose evolution is similar to the behavior of some non linear oscillating systems with a control, where the control can be represented by a simple function of the temporal interval between two consecutive peaks. The result of the analysis suggests the existence of dynamics on a 6-8 h time scale. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Building and Restoring a Healthy Aquatic Ecosystem
SO LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS
AB Cities are suffering from more floods than ever, causing huge loss of life and property. The reason is that modern cities often lack resilience to the uncertainty of natural disasters. Aquatic ecosystems on the whole are unhealthy. As global climate change intensifies, aquatic ecosystems are facing more severe challenges. The author explains the necessity to cope with water-related issues holistically, and contends that aquatic ecosystems should be evaluated, protected, and restored based on the understanding of ecosystem services they provide. The water security patterns at macro, medium, and micro levels help improve the resilience of aquatic ecosystems, restore the aquatic and hydrophytic habitats, reconstruct the harmony and symbiosis between water systems and humans, and nourish the health and prosperity of ecological civilization.

TI Distribution, Prevalence, and Antibiotic Susceptibility Profiles of
   Infectious Noncholera Vibrio Species in Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB Background. The noncholera Vibrio spp. which cause vibriosis are abundantly found in our water ecosystem. These bacteria could negatively affect both humans and animals. To date, there is a paucity of information available on the existence and pathogenicity of this particular noncholera Vibrio spp. in Malaysia in comparison to their counterpart, Vibrio cholera. Methods. In this study, we extracted retrospective data from Malaysian surveillance database. Analysis was carried out using WHONET software focusing noncholera Vibrio spp. including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio hollisae (Grimontia hollisae), Vibrio mimicus, Vibrio metschnikovii, and Vibrio furnissii. Results. Here, we report the first distribution and prevalence of these species isolated in Malaysia together with the antibiotic sensitivity profile based on the species. We found that V. parahaemolyticus is the predominant species isolated in Malaysia. Noticeably, across the study period, V. fluvialis is becoming more prevalent, as compared to V. parahaemolyticus. In addition, this study also reports the first isolation of pathogenic V. furnissii from stool in Malaysia. Conclusion. These data represent an important step toward understanding the potential emergence of noncholera Vibrio spp. outbreaks.

TI Assessment of ecological quality of coastal lagoons with a combination
   of phytobenthic and water quality indices
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Coastal lagoons are ecotones between continents and the sea. Coastal lagoons of Western Greece, subjected to different human pressures, were classified into four different types based on their hydromorphological characteristics and monitored over a three year period for their biotic and abiotic features. Six ecological indices based on water quality parameters (TSI-Chl-a, TSI-TP, TRIX), benthic macrophytes (E-MaQI, EEI-c) and an integrated index TWQI were applied to assess the ecological status of studied lagoons under real conditions. The trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to hypertrophic according to the index applied. The ecological quality of transitional water ecosystems can be better assessed by using indices based on benthic macrophytes as changes in abundance and diversity of sensitive and tolerant species are the first evidence of incoming eutrophication. The multi-parametric index TWQI can be considered appropriate for the ecological assessment of these ecosystems due to its robustness and the simple application procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Grazing on autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton by ciliates
   isolated from Lake Kinneret, Israel
SO JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
AB The rates of ingestion of three ciliates (Colpoda steinii, Cyclidium sp. and Stylonichia sp.) on fluorescently labeled heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus P, CN) and a picoeukaryote isolated from Lake Kinneret were measured. Uptake values were 930, 35 and 1210 bacteria ciliate (cil)(-1) h(-1) for Colpoda, Cyclidium and Stylonichia, respectively, depending on prey concentrations. An increase in prey concentration resulted in a decrease in clearance rates from 405 to 32 nl cil(-1) h(-1). Clearance rates of Colpoda fed on Synechococcus (P, CN) and on picoeukaryotes ranged from 27 to 62 and from 3 to 7 nl cil(-1) h(-1), respectively. Cyclidium, which is classified as a picoplankton feeder, showed lower clearance rates when fed on Synechococcus P and bacteria. Specific clearance (body volume cell(-1) h(-1)) for the three ciliates studied decreased when prey supply increased, for all three food sources. Relating to body volume, Colpoda could manage successfully on bacteria as its sole food source. It appears from our measurements that bacteria in Lake Kinneret are abundant enough to sustain the carbon requirements of Colpoda.

Following exposure to a glyphosate-based herbicide, our results showed that Evans Blue did not adequately measure cell viability in either species, while MTT and Neutral Red were able to detect decreased cellular viability for both algae in response to herbicide exposure. Overall, however, Neutral Red proved to be more sensitive than MTT for these algae.

TI Eutrophication causes invertebrate biodiversity loss and decreases
   cross-taxon congruence across anthropogenically-disturbed lakes
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Eutrophication is a major problem currently impacting many surface water ecosystems. Impacts of increased nutrient concentrations on biodiversity may differ between different scales, different organism groups, and different trophic states. Surveys at different spatial scales have suggested that biodiversity of different taxa may exhibit significant cross-taxon congruence. In our study, we examined the diversity of zooplankton and zoobenthos across 261 lakes in the Lake Taihu watershed, an area that is undergoing a severe eutrophication process. We tested the cross-taxon congruence in species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity between zooplankton and zoobenthos along a nutrient gradient across the lakes. Our findings were consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, considering nutrient input as the disturbance. Also, we found significant cross-taxon congruence between zooplankton and zoobenthos diversities. Our results confirmed that excess nutrient levels resulted in diversity loss and community simplification. Zoobenthos were more sensitive to nutrient increases compared with zooplankton, which decreased cross-taxon congruence because these organism groups did not respond similarly to the anthropogenic disturbance.

TI Metals in the sediment and liver of four fish species from different
   trophic levels in Tisza River, Serbia
SO CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
AB In aquatic environments metals originate from various natural and anthropogenic sources. The degree of contamination in fish tissues depends on the pollutant, fish species, their mode of feeding, sampling site and trophic level. This study presents concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr and Zn in sediment and liver of four ecologically different fish species: piscivorous northern pike (Esox lucius L.), benthivorous sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus L.) and silver bream (Brama brama L.), and omnivorous common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Fish were caught at four sites along the stretch of the River Tisza in Serbia during October 2010. The concentrations of metals have been assessed using the inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry. Results revealed that metals with the highest values in sediment and fish samples were Al and Fe, respectively and sometimes concentrations of Zn are in the same order of magnitude as Fe concentrations. The highest concentration of metals was recorded in omnivorous common carp.

TI Comparative Study of Water Resource Management and Policies for
   Ecosystems in China and Denmark
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
AB This paper compares water resource policies and management practices in China and Denmark. It takes two vulnerable water ecosystems as case studies: Baiyangdian wetland in China and Manager fjord in Denmark. Based on the theories of the commons, this article explores the similarities and differences between the two ecosystems in terms of ecosystem characteristics, historical and cultural backgrounds of these societies, the technologies affecting the ecosystems and also how the ecosystems have been seen at different times as well as the existence of property rights through time. Both water bodies have experienced drastic and devastating impacts from human activities. The analysis shows both in Denmark and China, it can be expected that goals, once they are decided, will be implemented. But, in reality, it seems that this will be much easier to accomplish in Denmark than in China, probably due to the complicated administrative structure in China and clearer goals and better resources in Denmark. Denmark has also accomplished a large degree of environmental policy integration (EPI), which is not the case in China. But China has recently put environmental concerns high on the agenda, giving priority to environmental concerns, even highlighting sustainability as a future developmental goal. Denmark has also established a much more effective regulation of the different sectors contributing to the pollution of the ecosystems than China has.

The Baltic Sea Area was designated as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) at IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee's 53rd session in July 2005. Contemporary hierarchical maritime navigation safety management system from global to local level is considered as a basis for implementation of the System Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) approach to architecting the maritime navigation safety control system. This paper introduces the STAMP-Mar research concept and application positions under development aimed at dynamic safety management of eco-socio-technical maritime navigation system that will network existing systems, systems already under development, and systems to be developed to meet the system safety requirements and to enable high levels of joint connectivity, situational awareness and understanding. Issue is exemplified by outlining the systems theoretic STAMP-Mar framework applied to safety management of maritime navigation in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea).

On December 13, 2018, the Yangtze Ecology and Environment Co., Ltd. was established in Wuhan City, Hubei Province as the key implementer under the China Three Gorges Corporation to promote the Comprehensive Conservation of the Yangtze River in a market-oriented way. In the exploration of environmental protection path, "from pilot programs to experience summary, refinement, and promotion" method is adopted. Besides, two strategies are proposed: to integrate the sewage plants and the pipeline network to ensure the operation of the sewerage system safe and efficient; to integrate sewage plants, pipeline networks, river for lake), and banks to reduce water pollution and restore the water ecosystem systematically. Furthermore, targeted strategies are put forward in different cities. After the environment is recovered and residents' living quality is improved, the city can attract more investments and industries and a sustainable value chain of enterprises would be formed. Finally, all administrative bodies should serve the roles of resource suppliers and coordinators, acquiring expertise knowledge, learning the requirements of the service objects, and facilitating coordination and communication positively.

The problem of the Azov Sea preservation and recovery of its commercial fishing value can be primarily achieved through restoring its natural characteristics such as volume and duration. The ecological state of this water ecosystem is characterized as unsatisfactory since it is subjected to a considerable level of anthropogenic load. Thus, there is an urgent need for immediate management decisions that will help stabilize the state of the ecosystem and neutralize the consequences of the anthropogenic load exerted on the ecosystem.

TI Joint Spatial Modeling of Nutrients and Their Ratio in the Sediments of
   Lake Balaton (Hungary): A Multivariate Geostatistical Approach
SO WATER
AB Eutrophication, water quality, and environmental status of lakes is a global issue that depends not only on external loadings from industrial, agricultural, and municipal sources but often also on internal loadings from lake sediments. In the latter case, in addition to the quality and quantity of nutrients stored in sediments, their relative content may be an important factor. In the example of Lake Balaton, we jointly modeled the spatial distribution of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their ratio (i.e., N:P) in the sediments of the lake and then provided spatial predictions at different scales (i.e., point, basin, and entire lake) with the associated uncertainty. Our aim was to illustrate the merits of applying multivariate geostatistics when spatial modeling of more than one variable is targeted at various scales in water ecosystems. Variography confirmed that there is a spatial interdependence between the nutrients. The results revealed that multivariate geostatistics allows this interdependence to be taken into account and exploited to provide coherent and accurate spatial models. Additionally, stochastic realizations, reproducing the joint spatial variability, can be generated that allow providing spatially aggregated predictions with the associated uncertainty at various scales. Our study highlighted that it is worthy of applying multivariate geostatistics in case spatial modeling of two or more variables, which jointly vary in space, is targeted in water ecosystems.

TI Land use changes and hydrological impacts related to up-scaling of
   rainwater harvesting and management in upper Ewaso Ng'iro river basin,
   Kenya
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Some land use changes are driven by the need to improve agricultural production and livelihoods. Rainwater harvesting and management is one such change. It aims to retain additional runoff on agricultural lands for productive uses. This may reduce river flows for downstream users and lead to negative hydrological, socio-economic and environmental impacts in a river basin. On the other hand, rainwater storage systems may lead to positive impacts by reducing water abstractions for irrigation during dry periods. This paper presents a conceptual framework for assessing the impacts of land use changes in the upper Ewaso Ng'iro river basin in Kenya. It is based on a people-water-ecosystem nexus and presents the key issues, their interactions and how they can be addressed. The paper presents hydrological assessment of up-scaling rainwater harvesting (HASR) conceptual framework, which assesses the impacts of land use changes on hydrological regime in a river basin. The results will enhance formulation of sustainable land and water resources management policies and strategies for water-scarce river basins. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Providing online access to hydrological model simulations through
   interactive geospatial animations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB Hydrological transport models are a vital tool in understanding and improving the health of water ecosystems. However, there are significant barriers that prevent the sharing and re-use of the modelling software and the outputs from modelling various scenarios. Technical barriers to providing models on the Web include: the volume of data involved, the complexity of the software that executes the models, and the computational demands of model execution. In this paper, we describe a Web-based repository developed to provide high-speed, interactive access to online simulations of hydrological models. The models are executed in advance and the results cached to expedite delivery. The adoption of an open-source geospatial platform minimises latency and allows streaming of animated model results. Interactive access to such visualisations enables users to rapidly understand the impact of alternative management actions on water quality. We demonstrate our system in terms of the Receiving Water Quality Model applied to the Moreton Bay system of South-East Queensland by local water authorities. By adopting a Web-based platform and open standards, we enable previously inaccessible models and datasets to be made available for exploration and re-use by a wider set of stakeholders and decision makers.

TI SELECTION OF NATURAL SORBENTS FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT
SO NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF
   KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With the development of heavy and light industry we have passed the technical revolution that lifted us to another level of global human evolution, but nothing is going so smoothly without any reason of consequences.
   For example, nowadays, 80% of industrial companies merge their waste in natural waters (rivers, lakes, and even the soil), thereby forming the wastewater. Wastewater pollution problem is not less important than air pollution, because the water ecosystem is deteriorating, which will entail a large-scale ecological catastrophe, from exhaustion and losing of aquatic fauna and flora to fatal human diseases due to drinking water. In this connection, a question about effective ways of wastewater treatment appeared. This review article describes the wastewater pollution problems and examines the effectiveness of the using the natural sorbents for cleaning. Also the role of the porous structure in adsorption processes has been considered. There were results of identified using peat, bentonite, marl as sorbents for purification of wastewaters on an example of electroplating industry with different contents of copper ions. The mechanisms of interaction of copper ions with bentonite for more efficient use was identified by experiments.

TI The Tax Burden on Wastewater and the Protection of Water Ecosystems in
   EU Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB 80% of all wastewater is discharged into the environment without first eliminating contaminants, and the consequences are cause for concern. The ecotaxes levied on effluents in many developed countries are aimed at preventing and minimizing water pollution and also, in part, helping to finance proper water reclamation facilities. The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the current tax burden in a set of European Union countries on wastewater discharges and to assess its relationship with the quality of fresh water and other economic and political variables. The paper draws on different theoretical arguments and estimates a panel data model to verify the effectiveness of taxes in protecting aquatic ecosystems. These taxes are directly dependent on the environmental health status of water and inversely linked to the volume of discharged wastewater. In addition, a direct relationship is found between the tax burden on wastewater discharges and the variables representing the Human Development Index, the per capita expenditure on protecting water resources, the relative weight of ecotaxes in a country's total tax revenues, and public support for green political movements.

TI Development of a fluorescent multiwell assay for evaluating the capacity
   of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena for bacterivory in water samples
SO WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA
AB Bacterivory by ciliates in various water ecosystems, both natural and artificial, plays a significant role on the microbial population composition and consequently affects water quality. A convenient, rapid and inexpensive methodology to evaluate the capacity of the ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila for bacterivory was developed utilizing fluorescent protein expressing bacteria (FPEB) in a microtitre plate fluorimeter. Bacterivory was correlated with a loss in fluorescence measured in the fluorimeter and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy showing that the FPEB were engulfed during the assay and subsequently lost their fluorescence, whereas Cytochalasin B, a known inhibitor of phagocytosis, prevented a decrease in relative fluorescence units (RFUs). The ciliate bacterivory (CB) assay has a great dynamic range allowing the assay to be performed with a variety of predator:prey concentrations. A model toxicant, CuCl2, known to have a toxicological impact on protozoa and often present in different types of wastewater, resulted in measurable decreases in bacterivory. As well, starvation of Tetrahymena for 24 h resulted in reduced bacterivory. In the future, the CB assay could be developed for water monitoring purposes to rapidly assess water samples for the capacity to support bacterivory as an indicator of ecosystem health.

TI Zooplankton community structure along a pollution gradient at fine
   geographical scales in river ecosystems: The importance of species
   sorting over dispersal
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB The release of anthropogenic pollution into freshwater ecosystems has largely transformed biodiversity and its geographical distribution patterns globally. However, for many communities including ecologically crucial ones such as zooplankton, it is largely unknown how different communities respond to environmental pollution. Collectively, dispersal and species sorting are two competing processes in determining the structure and geographical distribution of zooplankton communities in running water ecosystems such as rivers. At fine geographical scales, dispersal is usually considered as the dominant factor; however, the relative role of species sorting has not been evaluated well, mainly because significant environmental gradients rarely exist along continuously flowing rivers. The Chaobai River in northern China represents a rare system, where a significant environmental gradient exists at fine scales. Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing to characterize complex zooplankton communities collected from the Chaobai River, and tested the relative roles of dispersal and species sorting in determining zooplankton community structure along the pollution gradient. Our results showed distinct patterns of zooplankton communities along the environmental gradient, and chemical pollutant-related factors such as total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were identified as the major drivers for the observed patterns. Further partial redundancy analyses showed that species sorting overrode the effect of dispersal to shape local zooplankton community structure. Thus, our results reject the dispersal hypothesis and support the concept that species sorting caused by local pollution can largely determine the zooplankton community structure when significant environmental gradients exist at fine geographical scales in highly polluted running water ecosystems.

TI Long-term joint effect of nutrients and temperature increase on algal
   growth in Lake Taihu, China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB To study how global warming and eutrophication affect water ecosystems, a multiplicative growth Monod model, modified by incorporating the Arrhenius equation, was applied to Lake Taihu to quantitatively study the relationships between algal biomass and both nutrients and temperature using long-term data. To qualitatively assess which factor was a limitation of the improved model, temperature variables were calculated using annual mean air temperature (AT), water temperature (WT), and their average temperature (ST), while substrate variables were calculated using annual mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and their weighted aggregate (R), respectively. The nine fitted curves showed that TN and AT were two important factors influencing algal growth; AT limited growth as algal photosynthesis is mainly carried out near the water surface; N leakage of phytoplankton and internal phosphorus load from sediment explains why TN was the best predictor of peak biomass using the Monod model. The fitted results suggest that annual mean algal biomass increased by 0.145 times when annual mean AT increased by 1.0 degrees C. Results also showed that the more eutrophic the lake, the greater the effect AT had on algal growth. Subsequently, the long-term joint effect of annual temperature increase and eutrophication to water ecosystems can be quantitatively assessed and predicted.

High costs and deficient available capacity associated with incineration technology motivates investigation of bioremediation as a treatment alternative. Biodegradation of benzo [a] pyrene found in oil refinery and petrochemical plant sludges has been studied using a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. Evaluation of microbial growth showed that the Monod growth model was most appropriate with kinetic coefficients indicating microbial populations are capable of performing similar to that found in conventional suspended growth waste treatment systems.

TI Research on Cyanobacterial-Bloom Detection Based on Multispectral
   Imaging and Deep-Learning Method
SO SENSORS
AB Frequent outbreaks of cyanobacterial blooms have become one of the most challenging water ecosystem issues and a critical concern in environmental protection. To overcome the poor stability of traditional detection algorithms, this paper proposes a method for detecting cyanobacterial blooms based on a deep-learning algorithm. An improved vegetation-index method based on a multispectral image taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was adopted to extract inconspicuous spectral features of cyanobacterial blooms. To enhance the recognition accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms in complex scenes with noise such as reflections and shadows, an improved transformer model based on a feature-enhancement module and pixel-correction fusion was employed. The algorithm proposed in this paper was implemented in several rivers in China, achieving a detection accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms of more than 85%. The estimate of the proportion of the algae bloom contamination area and the severity of pollution were basically accurate. This paper can lay a foundation for ecological and environmental departments for the effective prevention and control of cyanobacterial blooms.

TI Assessing distribution shifts and ecophysiological characteristics of
   the only Antarctic winged midge under climate change scenarios
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Parts of Antarctica were amongst the most rapidly changing regions of the planet during the second half of the Twentieth Century. Even so, today, most of Antarctica remains in the grip of continental ice sheets, with only about 0.2% of its overall area being ice-free. The continent's terrestrial fauna consists only of invertebrates, with just two native species of insects, the chironomid midges Parochlus steinenii and Belgica antarctica. We integrate ecophysiological information with the development of new high-resolution climatic layers for Antarctica, to better understand how the distribution of P. steinenii may respond to change over the next century under different IPCC climate change scenarios. We conclude that the species has the potential to expand its distribution to include parts of the west and east coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula and even coastal ice-free areas in parts of continental Antarctica. We propose P. steinenii as an effective native sentinel and indicator species of climate change in the Antarctic.

SO SPRINGERPLUS
AB The aims of this study were to determine the microbial community in five rivers in the proximity of a city in the Czech Republic using 454-pyrosequencing, as well as to assess seasonal variability over the course of 1 year and to identify the factors influencing the structure of bacterial communities. Samples from five rivers around the city of Brno were obtained during four seasons and analysed using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core composition of bacterial communities consisted of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, TM7 and others. Our approach enabled us to more closely study the correlation between the abundance of different families and environmental factors. Overall, Actinobacteria negatively correlated with phosphorus, sulphate, dissolved particle and chloride levels. In contrast, Proteobacteria positively correlated with sulphate, dissolved particle, chloride, dissolved oxygen and nitrite levels. Future work should focus on the dynamics of bacterial communities present in river water and their relation to the overall stability of the water ecosystem.

To find ultimate solutions to the water problems and the way of sustainable water utilization, artificial water cycling system with the whole urban water ecosystem is analyzed. After a comparative analysis of urban water ecosystem and steady natural ecosystem, unsmooth flowing and unbalanced in-out of matter is put forward as the inducement of water problems. It is quite necessary to strengthen wastewater-disposal making it accord with exploitation and using, and to strengthen water renewal forming efficient circulation. In all, water utilizing model should be completed. Reduce, reuse, recycle principle can be applied to promote water cycling efficiency. For further study wastewater can be utilized as resources with technical innovation.

SO PERSOONIA
AB During an oomycete survey in December 2015, 10 previously unknown Halophytophthora taxa were isolated from marine and brackish water of tidal ponds and channels in saltmarshes, lagoon ecosystems and river estuaries at seven sites along the Algarve coast in the South of Portugal. Phylogenetic analyses of LSU and ITS datasets, comprising all described Halophytophthora species, the 10 new Halophytophthora taxa and all relevant and distinctive sequences available from GenBank, provided an updated phylogeny of the genus Halophytophthora s.str. showing for the first time a structure of 10 clades designated as Clades 1-10. Nine of the 10 new Halophytophthora taxa resided in Clade 6 together with H. polymorphica and H. vesicula. Based on differences in morphology and temperature-growth relations and a multigene (LSU, ITS, Btub, hsp90, rpl10, tigA, cox1, nadh1, rps10) phylo-geny, eight new Halophytophthora taxa from Portugal are described here as H. brevisporangia, H. cele-ris, H. frigida, H. lateralis, H. lusitanica, H. macrosporangia, H. sinuata and H. thermoambigua. Three species, H. frigida, H. macrosporangia and H. sinuata, have a homothallic breeding system while the remaining five species are sterile. Pathogenicity and litter decomposition tests are underway to clarify their pathological and ecological role in the marine and brackish-water ecosystems. More oomycete surveys in yet undersurveyed regions of the world and population genetic or phylogenomic analyses of global populations are needed to clarify the origin of the new Halophytophthora species.

Moreover, once they have entered the environment, antibiotics can affect natural microbial communities. The latter play a key role in fundamental ecological processes, most importantly the maintenance of soil and water quality. In fact, they are involved in biogeochemical cycling and organic contaminant degradation thanks to their large reservoir of genetic diversity and metabolic capability. When antibiotics occur in the environment, they can hamper microbial community structure and functioning in different ways and have both direct (short-term) and indirect (long-term) effects on microbial communities. The short-term ones are bactericide and bacteriostatic actions with a consequent disappearance of some microbial populations and their ecological functioning. The indirect impact includes the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and in some cases bacterial strains able to degrade them by metabolic or co-metabolic processes. Biodegradation makes it possible to completely remove a toxic compound from the environment if it is mineralized.
   Several factors can influence the significance of such direct and indirect effects, including the antibiotic's concentration, the exposure time, the receiving ecosystem (e.g. soil or water) and the co-occurrence of other antibiotics and/or other contaminants.
   This review describes the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of antibiotics on natural microbial communities in soil and water ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Entropy Index: New Opportunities in Assessing the Ecological State of
   Aquatic Ecosystems
SO RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
AB The paper proposes a new method for the integrated assessment of aquatic ecosystems based on dissolved oxygen concentration and water body temperature. The study proves the validity of assessing the state of aquatic ecosystems in terms of entropy change and the possibility of assessing the ecological state of water bodies based on the point values of the entropy index. The algorithm for the calculation of the entropy index based on water temperature and oxygen concentration according to point measurements is described, and the theoretically reasoned scale for the estimation of the state of water ecosystems is proposed. Based on long-term data on dissolved oxygen and water temperature obtained at the stations of the state observation network and Roshydromet automatic water quality control stations, as well as on experimental data, the entropy index is calculated for some water bodies in the Russian Federation. The advantages and prospects of practical application of the method for the surface water monitoring are discussed.

AB The quality of sediment was assessed at 33 sites in the Kuibishev water reservoir with the sediment quality TRIAD method. The TRIAD approach was used to assess relationships between effects on the benthos community structure, sediment toxicity and sediment contamination. The results of chemical analyses were evaluated using regional criteria for sediment quality. At most of 33 sites studied, the macrofauna community was poorly developed and indicated low abundances of benthic species and a high dominance of tolerant taxa. Acute toxicity test were conducted using the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacea Thamnocephalus platyurus, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, the protozoa Tetrachymena thermophila, and chronic contact tests were conducted with Daphnia magna. The results of bioassays indicated that sediment samples for 17 sites were acute toxic, while chronic toxicity was observed at 28 sites. Using the sediment quality TRIAD approach, accordance between sediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, and degraded benthic communities was observed. Chemical contamination was considered to be the participial factor causing the effects that were observed in the field.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The black-odor water in urban water bodies is increasingly found, resulting in serious atrophy of water bodies and degradation of water ecosystems. At present, the pollution status of the sediments as an internal source still remains much unknown. In order to assess the pollution status of black-odor water sediments, the content of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, organic matter and heavy metals in the sediments were determined by taking the black-odor water sediments in urban areas of Hunan Province as the research object. Geoaccumulation and potential ecological risks index methods were used to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments, and comprehensive pollution index method was used to evaluate nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient pollution in the sediments so as to provide pertinent information for urban black-odor water treatment. Finally, resource recovery potentials of sediments in black-odor water were revealed. The results could be beneficial for evaluation of sediments in black-odor water bodies.

TI Development of 30 SNP markers for the Daphnia magna based on
   restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq)
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES
AB Daphnia magna belongs to the Cladocera and plays an important role in the water ecosystem. With the intensification of water pollution, the wild population of D. magna has declined rapidly in recent years, and insufficient molecular markers have limited effective research and conservation of this species. In this research, 30 novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed in a cultivar of D. magna and 12 wild D. magna using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). The minor allele frequency, observed heterozygosity, and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.115 to 0.483, 0.073 to 0.800, and 0.077 to 0.520, respectively. The PIC ranged from 0.071 to 0.403. Six loci showed significant deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05).These newly developed polymorphic SNP markers for D. magna are of great significance in terms of the genetic breeding of D. magna, identification of wild and artificially domesticated species and conservation genetics research.

SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES
AB Determining trophic condition of a wetland is an important step in scientific assessment of the aquatic ecosystem. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, is mainly the result of human activities in agriculture, industry, etc. Increasing levels of nutrients result in eutrophication of water ecosystems. Regarding the importance of Anzali international wetland, the present study conducted several models of Carlsons on trophic status of the wetland through 1985, 2007, 2014 and 2017. The evaluated stations include, Bandar Anzali under bridge, Sorkhankal, PirBazar, Siadarvishan, Nokhaleh, east of wetlands, Hendkhaleh, and west of wetland. The results of Analysis of Variance indicated significant difference (p<0.05) among values of the indicators listed in stations and different seasons. Assessment of trophy index (TSI) on total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in order to reveal wetland condition determined oligotrophic and mesotrophic conditions in 1985 to acute hypertrophy in recent years. The results showed increase in the amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen during 1985 to 2017.

TI Nanosilver and Nano Zero-Valent Iron Exposure Affects Nutrient Exchange
   Across the Sediment-Water Interface
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB To examine how nanoparticles influence biogeochemical cycles in streams, we studied the acute impact of nanosilver (nAg) and nanoparticulate zero-valent iron (nZVI) exposure on nutrient and oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface of two streams (agricultural canal and wetland) that differed in their water quality and sediment characteristics. At the agricultural site, nAg increased oxygen consumption and decreased N-2 flux rates from that observed in control incubations. nZVI caused sediment-water systems from both streams to go hypoxic within 1.5 h of exposure. N-2 flux rates were at least an order of magnitude higher in nZVI treatments as compared to control. Water column nitrate and nitrite concentrations were not impacted by nZVI exposure but total dissolved phosphorus concentrations were higher in cores treated with nZVI. nAg and nZVI exposure to surface water ecosystems can disrupt ecological function across the sediment-water interface.

AB Phytoplankton is a quality element for determining the ecological status of transitional water ecosystems. In routine analysis, bio-volume and surface area of phytoplankton are the most studied morphometric descriptors. Bio-volume can be estimated by comparing the algae with similar three-dimensional geometric forms and determining their volume, by measuring the linear dimensions required for its calculation with images acquired by an inverse microscope. Software such as LUCIA-G (Laboratory Imaging) determines, in an automatic way, only the linear dimensions of simple forms such as circle or ellipse, approximated at a given algae, whereas complex forms require the intervention of an operator by selecting the start and end points of linear dimensions with obvious introduction of human error. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for detecting phytoplankton algae and by measuring linear dimensions of 42 geometrical forms to automatically compute their area and bio-volume, that has been implemented in a novel software, named LUISA, for image analysis.

TI Comprehensive Analysis of Prokaryotes in Environmental Water Using DNA
   Microarray Analysis and Whole Genome Amplification
SO PATHOGENS
AB The microflora in environmental water consists of a high density and diversity of bacterial species that form the foundation of the water ecosystem. Because the majority of these species cannot be cultured in vitro, a different approach is needed to identify prokaryotes in environmental water. A novel DNA microarray was developed as a simplified detection protocol. Multiple DNA probes were designed against each of the 97,927 sequences in the DNA Data Bank of Japan and mounted on a glass chip in duplicate. Evaluation of the microarray was performed using the DNA extracted from one liter of environmental water samples collected from seven sites in Japan. The extracted DNA was uniformly amplified using whole genome amplification (WGA), labeled with Cy3-conjugated 16S rRNA specific primers and hybridized to the microarray. The microarray successfully identified soil bacteria and environment-specific bacteria clusters. The DNA microarray described herein can be a useful tool in evaluating the diversity of prokaryotes and assessing environmental changes such as global warming.

TI BIOACCUMULATION OF ZINC AND COPPER BY Phragmites australis (CAV.) TRIN
   EX STEUDEL AND Typha angustifolia (L.) GROWING IN NATURAL WATER
   ECOSYSTEMS
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Zinc and copper play an important role in plant physiology. Nevertheless, when present in the environment at high concentrations they exhibit synergistic effects of toxicity to plants. Zinc and copper concentrations in sediments and water, as well as their accumulation in littoral plant species, were examined in this study. Five natural water ecosystems were chosen in the Poznan city area with Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia developed zones. Plants were divided into aerial and underground organs, i.e. leaves, stems and rhizomes (P. australis), and leaves and rhizomes (T. angustifolia). The measurements were conducted at the beginning and at the end of the summer season. Our investigation revealed the possibility of Zn and Cu removal from natural water ecosystems by two littoral plant species, even at low concentrations in sediments and water. There were differences in Zn and Cu sediment and water load in the city water reservoirs studied. Higher Zn concentration in the environment restricted the Cu uptake by plants. Transportation of Zn in P. australis to above-ground plant parts makes possible the use of this plant in phytoremediation, while in T angustifolia Zn was mostly immobilized in rhizomes. Cu was mainly accumulated in rhizomes in both littoral plant species, which suggested relatively low Cu concentrations in the environment and reduced translocation to above-ground plant organs.

TI MICROBIAL LEAF DECOMPOSITION IN ADIRONDACK STREAMS EXHIBITING PH
   GRADIENTS
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB The effects of water pH and related water chemistry parameters on microbial decomposition processes were studied in three small, low-order woodland streams located in the Adirondack region of New York State. These streams exhibited spatial and seasonal gradients in water pH ranging from pH values of 4.5 to 7.0. Measurements of microbial biomass (ATP), bacterial numbers, and bacterial production (thymidine incorporation) on leaves of Acer saccharum were made over a 9-mo period (fall to spring). Decomposition of A. saccharum leaves was significantly decreased at lower pH. The developing epiphytic microbial community was affected in a very specific way. Bacterial numbers were not related to water pH values, nor were ATP measurements significantly correlated with pH or any pH-related water chemistry variable. However, thymidine incorporation by bacteria on leaf material (used as a measure of bacterial productivity) was significantly decreased at lower pH. This was the only consistent indicator of reduced microbial activity in response to acidification of these streams.

TI BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CADMIUM AND LEAD UPTAKE BY PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS
   (CAV. TRIN EX STEUDEL) IN NATURAL WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY
AB In natural environment plants are exposed to many different stress factors, including heavy metals, whose elevated concentration causes oxidative stress, connected with formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, plants have developed defence Systems, including enzymatic antioxidant system, able to remove ROS.
   The work concerns the accumulation of two heavy metals, cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), as well as the phenomenon of oxidative stress caused by increased concentration of these metals in common reed (Phragmites australis), a dominant species in the littoral zone of many water reservoirs. The plants were obtained from four water bodies situated in Poznan: Kierskie Lake, Rusalka Lake, Strzeszynskie Lake and Solacki Pond.
   The aim of the study was to examined the accumulation of heavy metals and the relation between activity of antioxidant enzymes in rhizome, stem and reed leaves during the vegetative period. Three antioxidant enzymes were analyzed: ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
   The statistical analysis was done to determine the influence of the heavy metals on the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, involved in limiting and removing results of oxidative stress.
   Heavy metals were accumulated in common reed in all the four water reservoirs, but the activity of enzymes was variable during the observation period. Statistical analyses suggest that there are some correlations among concentration of metals and the activity of antioxidative enzymes. However, the results do not provide an unambiguous determination of the effect of heavy metals on enzymatic activity. Summing up, the contamination of the water ecosystems caused by heavy metals was so low that it did not influence the activity of the analysed enzymes.

TI Converting UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to Decision-Making
   Objectives and Implementation Options at the River Basin Scale
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations cover all living things on Earth. However, downscaling the SDGs to regional scales for implementation is challenging. In the paper, we convert the general SDGs into tangible and actionable goals, targets and indicators for use in integrated river basin management (IRBM). Further, we propose a decision support framework that can be used to support IRBM implementation based on the SDGs. The framework offers a context for open thinking in which IRBM decision makers envision socioeconomic and ecosystem goals and the development tracks of a river basin and explore the various paths that can be followed to reach the goals. In particular, indicators are proposed for use in IRBM, which consider five aspects of river basins, specifically water, ecosystems, socioeconomic development, ability and data. To enable decision-making that promotes progress toward the goals, five scenarios, 17 sub-scenarios and 29 key parameters are provided that form a diverse set of scenarios corresponding to specific decision schemes. Moreover, these scenarios, sub-scenarios and parameters consider future uncertainties and both engineering and non-engineering measures that can be taken to achieve the co-development of human and natural factors in a basin.

TI The Assessment of the Danube River Water Pollution in Serbia
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Actual problems of water ecosystem pollution require the ecological classification and the identification of the most influential parameters on the variability of water quality, stressing the importance of both in the realization of the sustainable water management principles according to the Water Framework Directive European Union (WFD EU), and the preservation of the quality of the environment. The aim of this paper was the assessment of the ecological status of water quality and calculating water pollution index (WPI) of the Danube River in Serbia. For all surface waters, the WFD requires "good ecological status," i.e., low level changes of the natural state that occur as a result of human activities by 2015. The assessment was based on the data obtained from ten hydrological measuring stations on the Danube River in Serbia for 2014. It was ascertained that the ecological status of the Danube River water quality was class III, corresponding to "moderate ecological status" and deviating from the required "good ecological status." According to the calculated WPI = 1.352, the water pollution of the Danube River in Serbia was characterized as moderately polluted and corresponded to class III of surface water. The ecosystem approach clearly indicated that the concentration of physico-chemical parameters of the watercourse deviated from the target values. Therefore, there is an urgent need to take some measures to prevent pollution and improve the water quality of the Danube River as an integral part of the environment in Serbia.

TI Integrating simulation models and statistical models using causal
   modelling principles to predict aquatic macroinvertebrate responses to
   climate change
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Climate change is projected to threaten ecological communities through changes in temperature, rainfall, runoff patterns, and mediated changes in other environmental variables. Their combined effects are difficult to comprehend without the mathematical machinery of causal modelling. Using piecewise structural equation modelling, we aim to predict the responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate total abundance and richness to disturbances generated by climate change. Our approach involves integrating an existing hydroclimate-salinity model for the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, into our recently developed statistical models for macroinvertebrates using long-term monitoring data on macroinvertebrates, water quality, climate, and hydrology, spanning 2,300 km of the Murray River. Our exercise demonstrates the potential of causal modelling for integrating data and models from different sources. As such, optimal use of valuable existing data and merits of previously developed models in the field can be made for exploring the effects of future climate change and management interventions.

TI METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WATER-HYACINTH-INFESTED FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Methane emission from waterhyacinth was studied under natural, laboratory and greenhouse conditions. The emission rate varied between 6 and 326 mg m-2 h-1; methane dissolved in surface water (11-61 mug l-1) was taken up by the plant and eliminated through the plant's ventilating system largely through the leaves. Although methane emission increased with increase in the content of dissolved methane, wind velocity, plant surface area and light intensity, there was no proportionality between methane emission and these factors. Methane emission was reduced about 70% in darkness. The optimum pH and soil temperature for methane production by methanogens was 33-degrees-C. Leaf tissues were most efficiently utilized by soil microorganisms for methane production. It has been estimated that in India alone 1.2 Tg of methane are emitted per year.

TI Phosphates from detergents and eutrophication of surface water ecosystem
   in India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Eutrophication, regarded as the most immediate environmental consequence of extensive phosphorus usage in contemporary societies, has received wide attention. If the current level of human-induced global environmental impacts continues, there is a chance of occurrence of nearly 2.4-2.7-fold increase in nitrogen and phosphorus driven eutrophication of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in the near future. The main sources of phosphate in aquatic environment, is through household sewage water containing detergents and cleaning preparations, agricultural run-off containing fertilizers, as well as, industrial effluents from fertilizer, detergent and soap industries. The consumption of synthetic detergents is increasing year-by-year due to increasing urbanization and most of them contain phosphate as a 'builder', which increases phosphate loading rates in water bodies. The estimated annual consumption of phosphate-containing laundry detergents for the current population in India is about 2.88 million tonnes and the total outflow of P is estimated to be 146 thousand tonnes per year. Therefore, a major point of concern for checking eutrophication of water bodies, particularly in sensitive areas, is how to reduce P inputs to surface waters.

TI Habitat-specific population trajectories in boreal waterbirds: alarming
   trends and bioindicators for wetlands
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB Identification of conservation priorities is a fundamental issue for successful nature conservation. This can be done by looking at population trends of species in different habitats. Boreal zone is the key breeding area for many Eurasian waterbirds. Wetlands of the boreal zone can be roughly classified into two different groups: nutrient-poor oligotrophic and nutrient-rich eutrophic water ecosystems. Earlier work has shown that eutrophic lake-specialist species have declined compared with generalists and species preferring oligotrophic lakes. However, it is not known if species that live in both habitats show habitat-specific population trends. We used monitoring data of breeding waterbirds in Finland from 1986 to 2013 to evaluate habitat-specific population trends in five generalist duck species, which mostly overwinter in the coastal waters of West Europe. Population trend of tufted duck was highly significantly more positive in oligotrophic wetlands compared with populations in eutrophic wetlands, and two other species had similar but weaker effects. In addition, we established bird population state indicators for oligotrophic and eutrophic water ecosystems in Finland. The indicators revealed that the populations in eutrophic wetlands have on average halved since early 1990s. The populations in oligotrophic wetlands have remained stable, except a moderate decline since the late 2000s. Our findings support the idea that the waterbird populations of the eutrophic wetlands are in serious trouble. This is likely due to over-eutrophication of these ecosystems. Conservation and management actions should be urgently taken to halt the loss of biodiversity in these globally threatened freshwater ecosystems.

TI RESEARCH PROGRESS ON THE WATER ENVIRONMENT, ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION ZONING
   AND SPATIAL MANAGEMENT OF WATERSHEDS IN CHINA
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB With the rapid development of the economy and society in developed areas, the discharge of water pollutants increases sharply, resulting in the continuous development of the regional water environment. It has become an important factor restricting the development of the regional economy and society. To coordinate the relationship between the water environment and economic development and provide a scientific basis for watershed management and regulation, many countries have carried out water environmental functional zoning research. At present, water environment zoning methods in China mainly include water environmental function zoning and water ecological environment function zoning and water environment pressure zoning, water environment sensitivity zoning and water environment system zoning derived from the above two methods. Water environmental functional zoning is based on the national economic development planning combined with the current situation of regional water resource development and utilization and social needs, scientific and reasonable delimitation in the conesponding waters with specific functions, meeting the requirements of rational development and protection of water resources, and playing the best benefits. Water ecological function zoning is a zoning method based on the regional differences in water ecosystems in a watershed. It clarifies the spatial differentiation characteristics of aquatic environmental systems at different scales, such as region and zone, and reveals the spatial distribution law of water ecosystems. This paper systematically reviews the process and characteristics of water environmental functional zoning and watershed water environment management and control in China, systematically expounds the types, indicators, methods and systems of water environment and water ecological zoning in China and analyses the role and experience of various water environmental zoning methods in watershed water environmental management. Based on the analysis of the current situation of water environment regionalization in China, combined with water environmental management requirements, this paper points out the defects of the water environment and water ecological regionalization and prospects its development trend.

TI Ecosystem science: toward a new paradigm for managing Australia's inland
   aquatic ecosystems
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Freshwater ecosystems are a foundation of our social, cultural, spiritual and economic well being. The degraded condition of many of Australia's river ecosystems is testament to our failure to manage these resources wisely. Ecosystem science involves the holistic study of complex biophysical systems to understand the drivers that influence ecological pattern and process. Ecosystem science should underpin both water management and policy. Our understanding of aquatic ecosystems lags behind the increasing problems caused by past land and water management. Current post-graduate training programmes will not provide the aquatic ecosystem scientists needed by government and management agencies to prevent further degradation. We advocate new initiatives to capture the skills, knowledge and innovation of our research community by engaging scientists and managers in large-scale, long-term ecosystem science programmes across Australia and to integrate these programmes with community aspirations, policy, planning and management. We call on management agencies to increase their support for and uptake and use of ecosystem science. We also advocate establishment of national archives for long-term ecologically-relevant data and samples, and clear custodial arrangements to protect, update and facilitate knowledge-transfer. These initiatives need to be supported by more extensive, better-funded post-graduate and post-doctoral programmes in ecosystem science and management.

TI Adaptive management, monitoring, and the ecological sustainability of a
   thermal-polluted water ecosystem: A case in SW Spain
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The construction of the Almaraz nuclear power plant in Spain in the 1970s posed interesting environmental problems concerning the construction of a cooling reservoir (Arrocampo reservoir) to cool the steam condensers and the consequent heating of the reservoir's water. The socio-political context forced decision makers to set up a project for the monitoring and management of the environmental impacts derived from the construction and operation of the power plant. Numerous scientific and technical specialists collaborated with the representatives of social groups towards two goals: the improvement of the biodiversity and of the efficiency of the cooling system. These goals involved the monitoring and managing of the system with respect to different biological aspects, mainly limnology, ichthyology, avian fauna and vegetation. The management plan yielded numerous results. The control of the water eutrophy is one of the most important due to its repercussion on the rest of the ecosystem, especially the fish fauna. The development of the shore vegetation slowly increased the patchwork nature of the reservoir, leading to a greater diversity of the avian species. This paper describes the monitoring and management of the Arrocampo ecosystem, the condition before and after the construction of the reservoir and the results obtained concerning some biological communities.

TI Application of a multidisciplinary and integrative weight-of-evidence
   approach to a 1-year monitoring survey of the Seine River
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Quality assessment of environments under high anthropogenic pressures such as the Seine Basin, subjected to complex and chronic inputs, can only be based on combined chemical and biological analyses. The present study integrates and summarizes a multidisciplinary dataset acquired throughout a 1-year monitoring survey conducted at three workshop sites along the Seine River (PIREN-Seine program), upstream and downstream of the Paris conurbation, during four seasonal campaigns using a weight-of-evidence approach. Sediment and water column chemical analyses, bioaccumulation levels and biomarker responses in caged gammarids, and laboratory (eco)toxicity bioassays were integrated into four lines of evidence (LOEs). Results from each LOE clearly reflected an anthropogenic gradient, with contamination levels and biological effects increasing from upstream to downstream of Paris, in good agreement with the variations in the structure and composition of bacterial communities from the water column. Based on annual average data, the global hazard was summarized as "moderate" at the upstream station and as "major" at the two downstream ones. Seasonal variability was also highlighted; the winter campaign was least impacted. The model was notably improved using previously established reference and threshold values from national-scale studies. It undoubtedly represents a powerful practical tool to facilitate the decision-making processes of environment managers within the framework of an environmental risk assessment strategy.

TI Internal armed conflict and environment in Colombia: analysis from
   ecological conflicts, 1960-2016
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
AB Based on an exploratory literature review and records in the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (https://ejatlas.org), this article analyzes 82 cases of environmental conflicts involving actors linked to the Internal Armed Conflict (CAI by its Spanish acronym) in Colombia. Using descriptive statistics, we analyzed the war and extractive actions, and the socio-environmental implications of the CAI in the cases studied. We distinguish the actors linked to the armed conflict, the modalities of violence, the impacts on ecosystems, and the most affected population groups between 1960 and 2016. We found that the intensive use of violence associated with CAI is a particularity that differentiates extractivism in Colombia from other Latin American countries. The CAI generated forced displacement, which in turn facilitated territorial control, appropriation of land and its resources, and advancement of extractivism. That these economic activities have the most intensive impacts on the environment, human rights, and vulnerable communities confirms this relationship. These activities correspond to biomass and land exploitation, mining, and fossil fuels extraction. In terms of environmental assets, we identified that forests and water ecosystems were the most affected. Moreover, three out of four cases analyzed show that the ethnic population was intensively harmed, evidence of a critical dimension of environmental racism in the armed conflict in Colombia.

TI Lithium extractivism and water injustices in the Salar de Atacama,
   Chile: The colonial shadow of green electromobility
SO POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB This paper analyzes the linkages and feedback between green electromobility, lithium extractivism, and water injustices affecting the Atacamen similar to o's indigenous communities in the Salar de Atacama basin (Atacama Salt Flats). Currently, lithium is in high demand in the international markets as a strategic resource for the green electromobility industry, which represents part of the Global North policies established by the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change's effects. Using both documentary and ethnographic methods based mainly on semistructured interviews conducted with Atacamen similar to o people, public officials, and lithium companies' representatives and workers, we propose a decolonial interpretation of lithium extractivism in brine mining through the lens of Latin American political ecology combined with a decolonial and water justice approach. The results demonstrate how the linkages and feedback between global and local dynamics of lithium mining in the Salar de Atacama constitute a form of green extractivism that further replicates the historical inequalities between the Northern and Southern hemispheres and especially affects the indigenous Andean territories and the water ecosystems in the Global South. We call this phenomenon the colonial shadow of green electromobility. We conclude by exposing the need to rethink global proposals addressing climate change by reducing the commodity demand and aiming for water justice at global and local levels.

TI SEASONAL VARIATION OF PLANKTONIC FUNGAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE
   XIJIANG RIVER, CHINA
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB To investigate the composition variation of planktonic fungal communities, and their relationship with water physical and chemical parameters in the Xijiang River in China, the compositions of planktonic fungal communities in the high-water and low-water period of the Xijiang River were studied in this paper by high-throughput sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicons. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Rozellomycota, and Zygomycota were detected from the planktonic fungal communities. However, most high-quality sequences (59.58 +/- 0.03%) could not accurately identify fungal phyla. Alpha-diversity indexes of the fungal communities and the relative abundances of Phoma brasiliensis, Pseudozyma sp., Psathyrella sp., Haematonectria haematococca, Podoscypha sp. in the high-water period were significantly higher than those in the low-water period, while the relative abundances of Basidiobolus sp., Rhizophydium littoreum, Teratosphaeria jonkershoekensis, Malassezia globosa, Malassezia resfricta, Malassezia sp., Alternaria eichhorniae, Knufia epidermidis, and Scedosporium prolificans were significantly lower. No significant correlation has been found between the fungal community distance and geographical distance along the river. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen significantly influenced the fungal community structure in the high-water period. These results provide information for us to understand the composition and influencing factors of the planktonic fungal community in rivers.

TI Ecosystem structure and function in two branches of an eastern
   Minnesota, USA, trout stream
SO JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY
AB Among freshwater systems, coldwater habitats are among the most threatened by climate change. Examining the impacts of increasing water temperature requires the use of both traditional biomonitoring efforts and measures of ecosystem function and structure. We examined fish and macroinvertebrate communities, leaf decomposition rates, periphyton production, and ecosystem metabolism to compare two branches of a trout stream in Minnesota with differing thermal regimes. The cooler South Branch had more coldwater fish, a higher index of biological integrity for fish but a lower index for macroinvertebrates. There were no differences in leaf decomposition rates between branches, although non-native buckthorn leaves decomposed faster than native black cherry leaves. Periphyton production was higher in the North Branch than the South Branch. Both branches had high nitrogen but low phosphorus levels. Nutrient enrichment with phosphorus enhanced periphyton production in both branches. Measures of stream metabolism, based on diurnal variation in oxygen levels, showed that both branches were heterotrophic. Despite higher periphyton production in the North Branch, gross primary production was higher in the South Branch. The bioassessment measures used in our study yielded inconsistent results, pointing to the need for multiple methods to examine and better describe potential responses to warming from climate change.

TI Effects of cyanobacterial blooms on submerged macrophytes alleviated by
   the native Chinese bivalve Hyriopsis cumingii: A mesocosm experiment
   study
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB In eutrophic shallow lakes such as Lake Taihu, China, cyanobacterial blooms often inhibit the growth of submerged macrophytes. The activity of filter-feeding bivalves may potentially support submerged macrophyte growth by reducing cyanobacterial density, but bivalve communities in, for example Taihu, are in decline as a result of overharvesting. In a factorial outdoor mesocosm experiment with and without bivalves at three concentrations of cyanobacteria, we studied the impact of filter-feeding bivalves on the growth of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans. The growth rate of V. natans was negatively related to the initial density of cyanobacteria but was always higher when bivalves were present than when absent, likely due to improved light availability. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding bivalves can alleviate the negative effect of cyanobacterial blooms on submerged macrophyte growths. In addition to external nutrient loading, macrophyte regeneration is of key importance in the restoration of eutrophic lakes from turbid to clear water conditions. Our results suggest that conservation or restocking of native bivalves may be a valuable measure in lake restoration, facilitating the development of macrophyte beds and help combat the symptoms of eutrophication in Lake Taihu and other systems facing similar problems.

In order to facilitate remediation techniques, it is important to understand the oxidation of sulfidic minerals, and the hydrolysis of the oxidation products that result in production of acid mine drainage (AMD), toxic metals, low pH, SO42- and Fe. This review has summarized the impacts of climate change on geochemical reactions, AMD generation, and water quality in semi-arid/arid mining environments. Besides this, the study included the effects of hydrological, seasonal and climate change on composition of AMD, contaminant transport in watersheds and restoration of mining sites. Different models have different types of limitations and benefits that control their adaptability and suitability of application in various mining environments. This review has made a comparative discussion of a few most potential and widely used reactive transport models that can be applied to simulate the effect of climate change on sulfide oxidation and AMD production from mining waste, and contaminant transport in surface and groundwater systems.

AB We review the patterns of recent range expansions and the biology of the invasive Ponto-Caspian predatory onychopod cladocerans: Cercopagis pengoi, Evadne anonyx, Podonevadne trigona, Cornigerius maeoticus and Cornigerius bicornis. Recent invasions of C. pengoi, E. anonyx and C. maeoticus into the Baltic Sea can be attributed to the climate change, facilitating invasibility of the eastern Baltic Sea coastal ecosystems by the warm water Ponto-Caspian species and intensive shipping activities via the Volga-Baltic waterway (European "northern invasion corridor"). All three species can be considered to be established in pelagic communities of the eastern Gulf of Finland. Only one onychopod species, C. pengoi has invaded the North American Great Lakes via an existing invasion corridor between the eastern Baltic and the Great Lakes. Invasive onychopods may possess adaptive life cycles, switching to early gamogenetic reproduction which enables their establishment in recipient ecosystems and further dispersal. Analysis of temperature and salinity ranges of the Ponto-Caspian onychopod species in native and invaded habitats, indicates that they are potentially able to form populations in a wide range of inland and coastal water ecosystems in temperate zones. Ponto-Caspian onychopods can be considered as "high risk" invasive species, in terms of their potential for range expansion and impact on recipient ecosystems.

TI Ecotoxicological and chemical characterization of selected treatment

SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB The triolein-containing semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed for 4 weeks in a sewage treatment plant in Beijing, China, to sample and concentrate priority hydrophobic organic pollutants in a sewage treatment process. The chemical analyses and ecotoxicities of the residuals of SPMDs dialysate were examined. The data from the chemical analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry selected ion monitoring mode indicated the lower removal for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) coincided with the persistence of them in the environment. The acute toxicity examined by bioluminescence test with Vibrio fischeri revealed approximately only 20% decrease in the overall toxicity of the influent after the activate sludge treatment process. The ethoxy resorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction with a micro-EROD assay in vitro using H4-IIE rat hepatoma cell cultures demonstrated the presence of persistent organics in influent and sequency effluents. Results obtained suggested that integration of the SPMD technique and chemical analyses and bioassay might be a valuable approach for the risk assessment of hydrophobic organic pollutants in water ecosystem. It revealed the necessity for organic pollutants monitoring and ecotoxicities examining of sewage treatment plants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using selected examples of recent research, this paper illustrates the role of abiotic components within running-water ecosystems. The important role of temperature is acknowledged but the paper focuses on another key driver: physical stability, defined in relation to hydrological (frequency, duration and timing of inundation) and substratum parameters (channel dynamics, bedform and sediment size). The importance of this driver is illustrated by reference to four spatial scales. At the scale of the bedform, surface-water and groundwater interactions play an important role not least in driving energy exchanges and determining the temperature dynamics within the ecologically important surface layer of the bed sediments. At the reach scale, bedform development, channel form dynamics, and associated changing hydraulic conditions determine both benthic and riparian community patterns. At the catchment scale, new research has shown that the processes responsible for the formation of islands and divided channels play important roles in the functioning of fluvial hydrosystems. Finally, at the regional scale, the flow regime modified by the geomorphological history of the river over at least the past 16 000 years explains ecological patterns. The integration of hydro-geomorphological knowledge from all four scales of analysis is shown to be fundamental for understanding the ecological characteristics of running waters and for managing ecological integrity.

TI Environmental risks for the fish fauna in the main rivers of central
   Macedonia (Greece)
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB Most of the inland water ecosystems are characterised nowadays as protected biotopes in Europe and they are subject to national and EU legislation. River ecosystems of Northern Greece and especially in Central Macedonia lately show a significant environmental degradation mostly due to the excessive exploitation of their natural resources, the pollution they receive and their improper management. Thus, their biological resources are disturbed and exhausted, especially their sensitive fish fauna, with a negative impact in the local socio-economic structure. This paper aims to determine the main environmental problems of the major river ecosystems affecting important risks for the fish fauna and the fish populations in Central Macedonia's region as the rivers Aliakmon, Loudias, Axios, and Strymon. Data about their fish fauna and the ecological status were collected from scientific references, studies, research programs and from the relative 'Fisheries Public Authorities' of each ecosystem. An important number of the species of the fish fauna of these river ecosystems is protected by particular national and international laws and conventions. The findings of the study can support the planning of sustainable and rational environmental friendly management and enhance the relations between biological resources and their habitats. The final results can contribute in the design of a total management plan for the protection of fish fauna in inland waters of Greece.

AB Water is a vital element on earth, no activity is possible without the presence of water both for human civilization and for industry and agriculture.
   In time, the development of society, through population growth and development of agriculture and various industries have increased water uses, but used and returned water has not the same quality as that taken prior to use, the water quality and quantity has become a real problem worldwide.
   Wastewater also evolved, enriching itself every day with different substances (detergents) and those not treated or inadequately treated once in emissary causes major imbalances in the ecosystems. Although water has the ability to self-purificate, in some cases contamination is done quickly and to a much higher degree that exceeds the capacity of water to recover.
   Self-purification is the process in which balance restoration of the aquatic environment takes place through simultaneous participation or in some sequence of the physical and chemical factors, biological, hydraulic and morphological characteristics of the river.
   An integrated analysis of these factors gives us complex information about water quality and in developing measures to help remedy its quality or to prevent degradation. [3]

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Use of various high molecular weight synthetic compounds as flocculants allows considerably increase the efficiency of physical-chemical methods for industrial wastewater treatment. Doing this, potential severe effects of residual amounts of these compounds on water organisms are not taken into consideration. Ecological-toxicological assessment of six flocculants: Magnafloc E1O, Zetag 64 (Germany); Sanfloc N520P, Sanfloc CH009P (Japan); Catfloc (U.S.A.); Polyacrylamide-PAA (Russia) was done in the course of our study. Flocculant toxic effects on water organisms of various systematic groups were found using international biotesting parameters. The flocculants affected all water ecosystem components and, especially, protococcal algae, invertebrates and adult fish. Acute and long-term experimental results showed the necessity of establishing maximum vital concentrations of flocculants. Comparative biological activity studies for different types of flocculants (cationic, anionic and nonionic) showed that cationic ones had the most expressed acute and long-term toxicity. According to the whole complex of pathological effects flocculants seem to possess the membranotropic mode of action. The results indicate flocculants as a new micropollutant class with high toxicity for water organisms. The control of their residual amounts in effluents discharged into receiving waterbodies is needed.

TI Spatial scale and benthic community organisation in the littoral zones
   of large oligotrophic lakes: potential for cross-scale interactions
SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB 1. We studied the spatial organisation of littoral, benthic invertebrate communities in two large oligotrophic lakes with very extensive heterogeneous littoral zones, and report that littoral communities show significant variation in their structure at multiple spatial scales.
   2. At coarser scales, littoral zone topography, riparian inputs and exposure may be important drivers of community spatial structure. At finer scales, the composition of substrates, particularly macrophytes and inorganic sediments, may be drivers of community spatial structure.
   3. The effects of substrates on community spatial patterns were non-additive across scales; community-habitat correspondence became very noisy when we attempted to extrapolate results throughout the littoral. We present some evidence to suggest that this non-additivity is because of the interaction among structuring processes that operate at different scales.

TI PICOPLANKTON IN 6 NEW-ZEALAND LAKES - ABUNDANCE IN RELATION TO SEASON
   AND TROPHIC STATE
SO INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE
AB The abundance of picoplankton (0.2-2-mu-m) was measured seasonally in the surface waters of six New Zealand lakes that represent a range of trophic states.  The lakes were:  Wakatipu, Te Anau, Manapouri, Hayes, Mahinerangi and Ross Creek Reservoir.  Among the lakes, picoplankton abundance was associated positively with temperature; picoplankton were most abundant in summer and autumn when they attained densities of 108,000-270,000 cells/ml in the oligotrophic lakes.  In these lakes, prokaryotic picoplankton was generally an order of magnitude more abundant than eukaryotic picoplankton.  Consistent with the hypothesis that picoplankton are more important in oligotrophic than eutrophic ecosystems, there was a weak negative correlation between the density of prokaryotic picoplankton in the lakes and the level of chlorophyll a.  The presence of large numbers of chroococcoid cyanobacteria in the guts of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Bosmina meridionalis implies that prokaryotic picoplankton are collected, but not digested, by these species.

TI Exploring the role of fish in a lake ecosystem (Lake Kinneret, Israel)
   by coupling an individual-based fish population model to a dynamic
   ecosystem model
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB To explore the role that fish play in aquatic ecosystems, a hydrodynamic ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was coupled to a novel fish population model. The coupled model (DYCD-FISH) combined two modelling approaches: a complex dynamic model and an individual-based model. The coupled model simulates fish growth population dynamics and predicts fish impacts on various ecosystem components, including nutrients and lower trophic levels. The model was employed to explore the role of the dominant fish in Lake Kinneret (Israel), Acanthobrama terraesanctae (Kinneret bleak, or in Hebrew, lavnun ha'kinneret; hereafter lavnun). Model results suggested that the lavnun has a significant impact (p < 0.05) on the magnitude of output variables including its prey food (the predatory and microzooplankton), major nutrients such as ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4), and on several phytoplankton species, but not on the seasonality of any of the output variables. Since the model incorporates trophic levels from nutrients to fish, it revealed the nonlinear dynamic impacts of fish on different ecosystem components and in particular has led to quantitative insights into the relative influence of top-down control on water quality attributes. Besides being an ecosystem research tool, DYCD-FISH can also be employed as a fishery management tool, and in particular facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management.

SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB This study uses published and unpublished data to create a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of available information on a little-known group of invertebrates, namely, non-marine giant ostracods (cypridids >= 3 mm long). Approximately 8% of the similar to 1000 living cypridid species are identified as 'giant'. They occur in a range of subfamilies, in all zoogeographic regions, except Antarctica, and mainly in small standing-water ecosystems. Only those in the subfamily Mytilocypridinae are reasonably well studied. This subfamily is endemic to Australia and comprises a diverse range of giant species (similar to 29 species in 6 genera), mainly in temporary habitats, mostly salt lakes, including in extreme conditions. We evaluate the current taxonomy of the Mytilocypridinae, analyse patterns in the field distributions and abiotic tolerances of species, and review the general biology of these ostracods. We also identify those species most in need of consideration in conservation planning, highlight critical gaps in knowledge and show how these ostracods could serve as useful models for testing ecological and evolutionary theories. The results of this study can be used to inform conservation planning for giant ostracods and direct further study of these unique invertebrates, which are an important component of the biodiversity of small standing-water ecosystems.

SO WATER SUPPLY
AB Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. From December 2012, five experiments were carried out along the main streams of the HRB. The monitoring indices contained physicochemical variables, habitat environmental indicators and the community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos. The correlations between species diversity and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis, correlation analysis method and redundancy analysis method. Results indicated that the species diversities of the Shaying River's upstream and Huai River's mainstream were better than the Shaying River's midstream and downstream. All the sections were divided into five clusters, and different clusters were affected by different physicochemical factors. Dissolved oxygen (DO), habitat quality index (HQI) and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) were the main factors affecting the species diversity of the Shaying River's upstream; total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), CODCr and permanganate index (CODMn) had a great influence on the Shaying River's midstream and downstream; DO, water temperature (WT), HQI and COD(Cr)were the main factors affecting the Huai River's mainstream. These results provide valuable information for policy decision makers and stakeholders on water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable watershed management in the HRB.

TI Environmental regulations and green innovation of enterprises:
   quasi-experimental evidence from China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Whether environmental regulations are conducive to improving green innovation in water pollution-intensive enterprises (WPIEs) is of guiding significance for China's protection of the water ecosystem environment and sustainable economic development. This study regards the implementation of the " Ten-point Water Plan" (TWP) policy in 2015 as a purely exogenous event for enterprises and employs a quasi-experimental method to fill this gap based on the panel data of Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2019. The results reveal that TWP policy has significant negative effects on the green innovation of WPIEs, the main mechanism of which is increased compliance costs. In addition, a heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative effect is stronger for green innovation activities with higher costs and for WPIEs subject to stricter environmental regulations. This paper provides new evidence against the weak Porter hypothesis and implies that WPIEs are likely to purchase technologies and equipment to reduce wastewater emissions rather than green innovation, which means incentive-based measures should be taken to foster green innovation in the environmental policymaking process.

TI Combined use of stable nitrogen and oxygen isotopes to constrain the
   nitrate sources in a karst lake
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Nitrate is a highly concerned pollutant in global aquatic ecosystem, resulting in eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As a result of the dissolved inorganic carbon fertilization effect, lake ecosystem is expected to respond more sensitively to nitrogen (N) addition in karst region than in non-karst region. Identifying accurately the sources of nitrate in lake system is an important prerequisite for formulating effective strategies on reducing nitrate and restoring water ecosystem. Quantitative identification of nitrate sources to lakes in karst region is limited until now. In this study, delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- were jointly used to identify the nitrate sources in Caohai Lake, a typical karst lake. The delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- of lake water displayed significant seasonal variations. The average delta N-15-NO3- values during normal, dry and wet seasons were 6.6 parts per thousand, 12.7 parts per thousand and 0.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Accordingly, the average delta O-18-NO3(-) values were 11 parts per thousand, 13 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively. The average contribution percentages of nitrate from agricultural activities, precipitation and sewage were 42 %, 41 % and 17 %, respectively. Strict measures should be taken to prohibit unreasonable agricultural activities and to improve nutrient use efficiency through optimized fertilization and irrigation management. In view of the sensitivity of karst lake ecosystem to N/P addition, higher discharge standard requirement is necessary for restoring water ecosystem and maintaining good water quality. This study proved that the combined use of delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3- is a promising method for identifying quantitatively the nitrate sources in karst lake system.

TI Thalassia testudinum as a potential vector for incorporating
   microplastics into benthic marine food webs
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Seagrasses are among the most productive shallow water ecosystems, serving a diverse assemblage of fish and invertebrates. Tropical seagrass communities are dominated by the turtle grass Thalassia testudinum, whose wide, flattened blades host diverse epibiont communities. Amidst its epibionts, T. testudinum may also be accumulating microplastics, which are a ubiquitous marine pollutant even in remote locales. To assess the extent of micro plastic accumulation, seagrass samples were collected from Turneffe Atoll, which lies offshore but parallel with a major urban center. Seventy-five percent of Thalassia blades had encrusted microplastics, with microfibers occurring more than microbeads and chips by a ratio of 59:14. Grazers consumed seagrasses with higher densities of epibionts. Potential mechanisms for microplastic accumulation include entrapment by epibionts, or attachment via biofilms. This study is the first to document microplastics on marine vascular plants, suggesting that macroherbivory is a viable pathway for microplastic pollution to enter marine food webs.

TI Assessment of the Metal Bioaccumulation in Three Species of Freshwater
   Bivalves
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB The metal concentration and body burden of three species of fresh water bivalves, Parreysia cylindrica, Parreysia corrugata and Corbicula striatella were estimated in laboratory experiment after exposure to chronic concentration of arsenic (0.1719 ppm), cadmium (0.23 ppm), copper (0.13 ppm), mercury (0.06 ppm), lead (2.4 ppm) and zinc (5.1 ppm) separately up to 30 days. Dry weight of each animal was used to calculate metal concentrations (mu g/g) and the metal body burden (mu g/individual). It was observed that zinc, lead and copper concentration and metal body burden was highest in the Corbicula striatella, mercury and arsenic was highest in Parreysia corrugata and cadmium was highest in Parreysia cylindrica. Therefore, Corbicula striatella is being proposed as sentinel organism for monitoring of zinc, lead and copper, Parreysia corrugata for mercury and arsenic, and Parreysia cylindrica for cadmium in fresh water ecosystem.

TI PRELIMINARY ASPECTS CONCERNING PHYTOPLANKTON STRUCTURE IN THE BALTA MARE
   - CARJA 1 FISH FARM
SO ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSITY DUNAREA DE JOS OF GALATI, FASCICLE VI-FOOD
   TECHNOLOGY
AB The present paper presents information on the structure and the dynamics of the water ecosystem's phytoplankton of the Carja 1 fish farm - Vaslui County, carps and Asian cyprinids are grown as common fish.
   To establish the structure and the dynamics of the phytoplankton, two samples from 6 stations were taken in the spring and in the autumn, using of a Garmin GPS 7-type navigation system. When analysing the number of individuals and the algae species present in the phytoplankton's structure, one can notice the low development level of the vegetable plankton.
   From the quantity point of view, one can notice the numerical abundance of the clorophyceae in all the analysed samples. The dominant species were: Scenedesmus acuminatus, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Tetrastrum staurogenieforme. The small number of species and algae specimens determined in the phytoplankton's structure emphasizes the reduced level of trophicity and biodiversity of the analysed ecosystem.

SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
CT 1st International Conference on Mathematical Modelling in Limnology
CY NOV 04-07, 1992
CL INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA
AB The use of regression, ordination and dynamic ecosystem modelling in limnology is discussed by evaluating some of the vices and virtues of these techniques. Both general characteristics of the approaches and a few examples are used to stress the importance of analysis of the residuals for evaluation of the models. Not completely unexpected, a simple ordination model did not perform worse than a complicated ecosystem model, both applied to the same lake system. Both models are shown to fail for prediction purposes, mainly because the error variance in the data used for parameter estimation is large compared to the variance that can be explained.
   Integration of regression, multivariate analysis and dynamic ecosystem modelling, all followed by analysis of the residuals, is advised. Nested models are proposed as a solution for the problem of changing parameters and for the problem of parameters being different among lakes.

TI A Location Selection Method for Wastewater Treatment Plants Integrating
   Dynamic Change of Water Ecosystem and Socio-Cultural Indicators: A Case
   Study of Phnom Penh
SO WATER
AB The selection of reasonable locations for urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is significant in controlling water pollution. However, most current WWTP location selection models focus only on population density, industrial zone scale and geographic elements, while ignoring water pollution and local socio-cultural indicators. We propose a novel indicator system from RS/GIS data to select reasonable locations for WWTPs in Phnom Penh to avoid water environmental deterioration and harm to human health. The frequency of occurrence of water eutrophication is derived from time series RS data and reveals the degree of pollution of local water ecosystems, and is included as a demand indicator for the first time. In order to respect local socio-cultural customs, buffer zones for religious sites are included in the indicator system for the first time to fully determine the zones where construction of WWTPs is forbidden. Subsequently, WWTP locations are selected with the fusion of the minimized facilities number and maximum coverage models. The results demonstrate that the selected locations are all highly suitable and outside zones where construction is forbidden. The method proposed in the article provides a more comprehensive and scientific perspective for WWTP location selection.

TI Rare inventory of trematode diversity in a protected natural reserve
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the face of ongoing habitat degradation and the biodiversity crisis, natural reserves are important refuges for wildlife. Since most free-living organisms serve as hosts to parasites, the diverse communities in protected areas can be expected to provide suitable habitats for a species-rich parasite fauna. However, to date, assessments of parasite diversity in protected nature reserves are rare. To expand our knowledge of parasite communities in natural habitats, we examined 1994 molluscs belonging to 15 species for trematode infections in a central European natural reserve. The parasitological examination revealed an overall prevalence of 17.3% and a total species richness of 40 trematode species. However, the parasite diversity and prevalence did not differ markedly from trematode communities in non-protected environments, which might be partly explained by a dilution effect caused by a high number of non-host organisms in our study system. The proportion of complex and long life cycles of parasites in the present study is high, indicating complex biotic interactions. We conclude that life cycle complexity, in addition to parasite diversity and trematode species richness, can provide valuable information on ecosystem health and should therefore be considered in future studies.

TI DOC photo-oxidation in clear water Amazonian aquatic ecosystems
SO AMAZONIANA-LIMNOLOGIA ET OECOLOGIA REGIONALIS SYSTEMAE FLUMINIS AMAZONAS
AB This investigation evaluated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) photo-production and its correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in several Amazonian clear-water ecosystems. and determined the changes in bulk DOC affected by solar radiation. The study was performed with samples from eight Amazonian clear-water aquatic ecosystems in the State of ParA, Brazil. We filtered four replicate samples through a 0.2-mum membrane and exposed them to sunlight in quartz tubes, with an equal number of dark controls, for six hours (from 9:00 to 15:00). After incubation, we measured DIC photo-production and changes in water colour (430 nm) and the absorbance ratio (250/365 nm). There was a weak significant (p <0.05) correlation between DIC photo-production and DOC concentrations considering all data set. However, we observed a strong correlation between DIC photo-production and DOC concentrations, considering separately ecosystems with similar conditions of sunlight exposure, e.g., separating large rivers and lakes from small streams (igarapes). We concluded that, besides the concentration and quality, the origin and the history of DOC in clear-water Amazonian ecosystems determine the rate of DOC photo-oxidation.

TI Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Associated with Groundwater
   Over-Exploitation Vulnerability: Geographic Information System-Based
   Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
SO NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Groundwater over-exploitation is related to various environmental, economic, and social aspects, which should be addressed comprehensively to support a sustainable water supply globally. This is the first study to delineate the sustainable development goals (SDGs) associated with groundwater management practices to minimize over-exploitation episodes. Ten thematic maps of hydrologic, geologic, and topographic layers for the Wadi El-Natrun basin, Egypt, were investigated using geographic information system-based multi-criteria decision analysis. The layers were integrated to obtain an overall vulnerability map, which showed that similar to 45%, similar to 35%, similar to 15%, and similar to 5% of the total basin area have 'high', 'medium', 'very high', and 'low' vulnerability index (VI) values, respectively. Field measurements of piezometric water levels fit well to the estimated VI values, depicting high validation accuracy (R-2 = 0.87). Based on sensitivity analysis, the vulnerability to groundwater over-exploitation was influenced highly by distance from feeding fault (DFF), followed by the aquifers hydraulic conductivity (HC) and land surface elevation. The western and southern zones of the basin were highly vulnerable to groundwater overexploitation because of long DFF, low HC, and dominance of upland plains, steep slopes, and elevated surface with increased groundwater depth. The interactions among all thematic criteria and vulnerability indices showed strong correlations with SDGs and associated targets regarding ending poverty and hunger, providing safe and affordable water utilization, supporting economic growth, and protecting land and water ecosystems. Defining SDG linkages would assist in sustainable water resource utilization, planning, and management worldwide, particularly in water-stressed areas.

TI Dynamic Markets for Dynamic Environments: The Case for Water Marketing
SO DAEDALUS
AB Static models used in economics and ecology ignore dynamic processes at work in both human and natural systems. In the case of water management, whether for quantity or quality, static models fail to connect changing human demands on water systems with changing supplies due to short-run climate variations and long-run climate change. Water markets provide a way of connecting human demands to nature's supplies through prices, which signal values and scarcity. For water markets to make this connection, water rights must be well-defined, enforced, and tradeable. When they are, entrepreneurs are able to meet old and new demands on water ecosystems in novel ways, as examples in this essay illustrate.

TI Water Conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Freshwater is a strategic natural resource in any region of the world, and this is especially true for the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Sub-Saharan Africa states, where water ecosystems are strategic resources, are oriented towards regional conflict rather than cooperation. However, its fossil fuels-principally, oil and natural gas-have constantly been exposed to scientific scrutiny. To compensate for the scarcity of scientific literature on the issue, the article analyses the role of the unequal distribution of freshwater that has been generating conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa from the time of decolonization. Next, these conflicts are examined. Recommendations on the non-conflictual use of water are provided.

TI Levy noise influences basin stability in a delayed vegetation-water
   dynamical system
SO CHAOS
AB The stochastic stability for the irregular attraction basin in a time-delayed vegetation-water ecosystem disturbed by Levy noise is explored. We first discuss that average delay time does not change the attractors of the deterministic model but affects the corresponding attraction basins, and we present the generation of Levy noise. Then, we investigate the influence of stochastic parameters and delay time on the ecosystem by two statistical indicators, the first escape probability (FEP) and the mean first exit time (MFET). The numerical algorithm for calculating the FEP and the MFET in the irregular attraction basin is implemented, which is effectively verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the metastable basin is defined by the FEP and the MFET and confirms the consistency of the two indicators reflecting results. The result shows that the stochastic stability parameter, especially the noise intensity, decreases the basin stability of the vegetation biomass. In this environment, the time delay effect can validly alleviate its instability.

TI Carbendazim: Ecological risks, toxicities, degradation pathways and

SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Carbendazim is a highly effective benzimidazole fungicide and is widely used throughout the world. The effects of carbendazim contamination on the biology and environment should be paid more attention. We reviewed the published papers to evaluate the biological and environmental risks of carbendazim residues. The carbendazim has been frequently detected in the soil, water, air, and food samples and disrupted the soil and water ecosystem balances and functions. The carbendazim could induce embryonic, reproductive, developmental and hematological toxicities to different model animals. The carbendazim contamination can be remediated by photodegradation and chemical and microbial degradation. The carbendazim could enter into human body through food, drinking water and skin contact. Most of the existing studies were completed in the laboratory, and further studies should be conducted to reveal the effects of successive carbendazim applications in the field.

AB Ammonium nitrogen (NH4 + -N), is one of the most common chemicals found in water ecosystems. Removal of ammonium, which is toxic to living things is a requirement and also important in terms of evaluating the regaining as a renewable energy source. In this study, membrane films were prepared from a natural biopolymer chitosan by solution casting method to remove ammonium from water. It was crosslinked by epichlorohydrine for stability and usage of that films as an adsorbent was investigated. The suitability of data obtained to adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetic models were investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity was reached as 15.6 mg NH4+N/g adsorbent for 100 mg solution concentration at 25 degrees C by using 0.25 g adsorbent dosage. The experimental equilibrium data were matched with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Adsorption process succeeded the pseudo-second- order kinetic model.

TI Global Water Governance in the Context of Global and Multilevel
   Governance: Its Need, Form, and Challenges
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB To complement this Special Feature on global water governance, we focused on a generic challenge at the global level, namely, the degree to which water issues need to be dealt with in a centralized, concentrated, and hierarchical manner. We examined water ecosystem services and their impact on human well-being, the role of policies, indirect and direct drivers in influencing these services, and the administrative level(s) at which the provision of services and potential trade-offs can be dealt with. We applied a politics of scale perspective to understand motivations for defining a problem at the global or local level and show that the multilevel approach to water governance is evolving and inevitable. We argue that a centralized overarching governance system for water is unlikely and possibly undesirable; however, there is a need for a high-level think tank and leadership to develop a cosmopolitan perspective to promote sustainable water development.

   The results show the association of the measured variables in 3 factors: water mineralization, biological (photosynthetically) related variables, and the nutritional factor, including P and N concentrations. Water mineralization variables were the most descriptive for each type of system. Calcium concentration can discriminate groups of water qualities in this system. Mineralization variables increased through the crop. On the other hand the biological factor showed a very close relationship with photon flux density variation along the crop; dissolved O-2 and pH decreased, but CO2 increased. The nutritional factor indicated elevated mean values for nutrients (N and P), but did not show an unique pattern of variation, indicating the strong influence of agricultural fertilization on the physicochemical features.

TI Enhanced primary production in summer and winter-spring seasons in a
   populated NW Mediterranean coastal ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
AB Populated coastal ecosystems in the NW Mediterranean present three main characteristics that distinguish them from the open water ecosystem: a sea-land interaction, with freshwater influence from river mouths; a shallow seabed, which facilitates the interaction between the euphotic water column and the sediments; and high anthropogenic pressure, due to submarine sewage discharges. As a result, relatively high nutrient concentrations are measured in these ecosystems, with ammonia being an important fraction. These characteristics entail a different scenario from the open water ecosystem.
   Here, we present the distribution of phytoplankton primary production in the Barcelona coastal waters during summer and winter-spring seasons, by means of photosynthesis-irradiance ekperiments using the C-14 technique. In winter-spring, stratification of the water column may begin earlier than in open water due to freshwater inputs. Therefore, with the water-column slightly stratified, chlorophyll-a and primary production become localised in the surface layers, due to the lower daily irradiance during this season. In these conditions, Total Primary Production (TPP) values measured ranged between 0.27 and 14.52 mgC m(-3) h(-1). As spring progresses and the stratification develops, surface waters tend to become nutrient depleted and nutrients are mainly localised in bottom waters between the thermocline and the seafloor. Under these conditions, high chlorophyll layers develop near the bottom. With the exception of their nutrient enrichment, these structures, referred to as coastal deep chlorophyll maxima, are comparable to the oceanic deep chlorophyll Maxima in temperate oligotrophic seas. The nutrient enrichment is the result of the sediment resuspension from the seabed and the presence of sewage water discharged from the submarine outfall. These structures are highly productive (ca. 60% of water column primary production), comparable to the winter-spring bloom, and are sustained throughout the stratified season. In this period, TPP values measured ranged between 0.25 and 9.02 mgC m(-3) h(-1).
   The primary productivity structures studied play a leading role in processing nutrients from terrestrial sources, thus providing an important ecosystem service. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The open water was characterized by picocyanobacteria and meroplanktonic diatoms, the artificial canal by epiphytic diatoms, cryptophytes and chlorophytes. The inner ponds, based on the phytoplankton composition, were positioned between these water bodies. High picoplankton abundance (> 10(6) cells.mL(-1)) and predominance (up to 80% contribution to the total phytoplankton biomass) were detected in the open water and the inner ponds, which was hypothesized to be the result of the turbid environment by the suppression of the top down control and by light-limitation. Information on the diversity of the picoplankton in the open water of the lake has been presented first time in this study. Based on molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene and cpcBA-IGS region) the dominant group of picocyanobacteria belonged to the Cyanobium gracile cluster (group A) of the picophytoplankton clade in April. Members of two other picocyanobacterial groups (group B and C) were also detected.

TI A review of the limnology of the Okavango Delta, Botswana
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
AB Water quantity and quality are important aspects in the management of aquatic ecosystems, including wetlands. This paper has integrated available knowledge from literature on the limnology of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The current near-natural solute concentrations in the inflow waters can be attributed to low chemical weathering of the quartz basin substrate and nearly absent anthropogenic nutrient sources within the Okavango Delta. The concentration of solutes in endorheic ecosystems is a natural phenomenon. In the Okavango Delta, this concentration is offset by the accumulation of solutes in groundwater beneath numerous treed-islands, due to evapotranspiration by evergreen trees. The freshwater environment has fostered high abundance and diversity of flora and fauna in a semi-arid environment. However, there are several aspects of the Okavango Delta that need more rigorous researched for management purposes. Some of the important knowledge gaps include the role of atmospheric deposition and animal excretion as sources of nutrients and trace elements into the system, and the influence of hydro-period on the distribution of trace elements especially in floodplain sediments, flora and fauna across the Okavango Delta. The issue of bioaccumulation of trace elements is also an important knowledge gap for the Okavango Delta particularly for wildlife and human health.

TI Faecal pollution affects abundance and diversity of aquatic microbial
   community in anthropo-zoogenically influenced lotic ecosystems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The aquatic microbiota is known to be an important factor in the sustainability of the natural water ecosystems. However, the microbial community also might include pathogens, which result in very serious waterborne diseases in humans and animals. Faecal pollution is the major cause of these diseases. Therefore, it is of immense importance to assess the potential impact of faecal pollution, originating from both anthropogenic and zoogenic sources, on the profile of microbial communities in natural water environments. To this end, the microbial taxonomic diversity of lotic ecosystems in different regions of Norway, representing urban and rural areas, exposed to various levels of faecal pollution, was investigated over the course of a 1-year period. The highest microbial diversity was found in rural water that was the least faecally polluted, while the lowest was found in urban water with the highest faecal contamination. The overall diversity of the aquatic microbial community was significantly reduced in severely polluted water. In addition, the community compositions diverged between waters where the dominant pollution sources were of anthropogenic or zoogenic origin. The results provide new insight into the understanding of how faecal water contamination, specifically that of different origins, influences the microbial diversity of natural waters.

TI Evaluation on real-time self-organization algorithm of forest
   cultivation, tea planting and tea processing for sustainable ecosystem
   management of agricultural water resources
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB Agricultural water resources are water resources that can be used for agricultural production, including surface water, groundwater and soil water. The sustainable use of water resources is of great significance to agriculture and rural economy. In the context of climate change and the increasing crisis of water resources, how to effectively use forest resources and other natural resources to achieve sustainable management of agricultural water ecosystems has become an increasingly urgent issue. Therefore, this paper proposed a real-time self-organization algorithm for forest cultivation, tea planting and tea processing for sustainable ecosystem management of agricultural water resources. This paper first described the sustainable ecosystem of agricultural water resources, carried out optimization analysis on tea planting and processing technology, using the genetic optimization algorithm based on decision tree and then carried out an experimental analysis on a tea garden. It can be seen from the data that the average monthly temperature of the tea garden cultivated by the algorithm in this paper was between 13.4 and 20.5 degrees C and the average annual temperature was 16.16 degrees C. However, the average monthly temperature of the traditional cultivation method was between 11.5 and 16.8 degrees C and the average annual temperature was 13.64 degrees C.

TI Elasmobranch egg capsules associated with modern and ancient cold seeps:
   a nursery for marine deep-water predators
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB At 2 modern deep-water cold-seep sites, the North Alex Mud Volcano (eastern Mediterranean Sea, water depth similar to 500 m) and the Concepcion Methane Seep Area (south-east Pacific Ocean, water depth similar to 700 m), we found abundant catshark (Chondrichthyes: Scyliorhinidae) and skate (Chondrichthyes: Rajidae) egg capsules, respectively, associated with carbonates and tubeworms. Fossilized catshark egg capsules were found at the 35 million year old Bear River Cold-Seep Deposit (Washington State, USA) closely associated with remains of tubeworms and sponges. We suggest that cold-seep ecosystems have served as nurseries for predatory elasmobranch fishes since at least late Eocene time and therewith possibly play an important role for the functioning of deep-water ecosystems.

TI Heavy metals in Lake Pamvotis (NW. Greece) ecosystem
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Metals enter the water-based trophic chains affecting the physiology and biodiversity of the water fauna. Lake ecosystems are more vulnerable to metal pollution compared to other inland water ecosystems due to their physicochemical characteristics. The evaluation of Cu, Zn and Pb impact on Lake Pamvotis of Ioannina district (NW. Greece) ecosystem is the aim of the present study.
   Water, surface and near-bottom samples as well as sediments were collected once per month over a year, from 2 different lake sites, one near the city and the other near the island of the lake. Fish tissues (muscle and liver) from various fish species (Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Parasilurus aristotelis, Tinca tinca and Rutilus rubilio) were also sampled. Our results show that metals (Zn, Pb and Cu) are significantly accumulated in the lake sediments indicating ecosystems' chronic insult by metals.

TI Risk assessment of water quality in the vicinity of a large-scale farm
   specializing in laying hens
SO AGROCHIMICA
AB The aim of this paper was to analyse the direct impact of a large-scale farm on water ecosystems in the surrounding zone and to assess the extent of surface water degradation caused by the farm. The research was carried out in areas adjacent to a laying hen farm (Europe's largest producer of consumer eggs) which is located in the Polish village of Zylice (Wielkopolska province, Rawicz municipality). The study concerned some physical and chemical parameters of the farm's surrounding waters at selected monitoring points in several water bodies (rivers, ponds and reservoir). The research indicates that the large-scale poultry farm in Zylice negatively affected the quality of surface waters in its surroundings. The highest degree of physical and chemical degradation of waters was recorded in the watercourse closest to the farm.

SO FISH MIGRATION AND FISH BYPASSES
CT Symposium on Fish Migration and Fish Bypasses
CY SEP 24-27, 1996
CL VIENNA, AUSTRIA
SP Univ Agr Sci, Dept Hydrobiol Fisheries & Aquaculture
AB One of the central ecological problems of running water systems, which are subject to multiple uses and therefore suffer disproportionate damage worldwide in comparison to other ecosystems, is the fragmentation of the longitudinal corridor by weirs of hydroelectric power plants and other water engineering measures. Restoring previously interrupted migratory pathways of fishes using bypass systems is one potential approach, but simply passing fish generally tends to overestimate the 'feasibility' and ultimate success of amelioration strategies in the framework of river revitalisation projects. This chapter attempts to show that running waters are far more than mere longitudinal river corridors. Modern concepts of ecology describe running waters as complex, four-dimensional systems. While longitudinal river corridors represent an important dimension, they are merely one of numerous factors whose interactions define ecological integrity. The long-term preservation and sustainable utilisation of running water ecosystems can therefore only be achieved by fully considering all four dimensions that contribute to overall ecological integrity.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Emerging contaminants and, among them, pharmaceutical compounds, have a significant impact on water ecosystems. Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH), being easy to synthesize and cheap materials, have recently gained attention as adsorbents in aqueous solutions. This work describes the latest research performed in the adsorption capacity of LDH towards both antibiotics and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) describing and analyzing the synthesis conditions (Me2+:Me3+ molar ratio, calcination temperature, choice of metals for the memory effect), kinetics and isotherm models used, use of support (more practical in a 3D over a 2D form), temperature effect and several techniques for the recovery of the adsorbents. LDH exhibited great performance and potential as clean adsorbents for these emerging contaminants.

TI Impact of Overpopulation on Land Use Pattern
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SURROUNDING HUMAN OVERPOPULATION
SE Advances in Environmental Engineering and Green Technologies
AB Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population, but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population. Overpopulation is one of the hazards and serious problem, which creates a great obstacle in the way of national development. It is estimated that growth in human population affect the global land use pattern available for agriculture, forest land cover, nearby area of different type of water bodies. The rapid increase of human population is putting extraordinary pressure on our natural resources available e.g. land, water, ecosystem services etc. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the various environmental implications of overpopulation and rural-urban migration which in turns affect the land use pattern of world. Deforestation and loss of ecosystems that sustain global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance is also another implication.

AB The BTC Pipeline crosses several sensitive areas in Georgia, including surface and groundwater bodies. The territory that is crossed by the pipeline is seismically active and there is risk of oil spillage. Any oil spilled from a damaged pipe will quickly mix with the river water. It is planned to construct permanent facilities equipped with five permanent tanks and six block valves on six tributaries of the rivers. Nevertheless, the risk of oil spillage remains dangerous for water ecosystems in these sensitive areas. A specific methodology of bio-indication and remediation of water ecosystems which would be used for emergency response in case of oil spills was tested in these sensitive areas. Laboratory experiments on raw oil show differences in sensitivity for a range of phytoplankton species. It is recommended to use indigenous Cyanobacteria Compounds for sensitive areas in the Borjomi region for remediation of oil spills.

TI Water, Ecosystem Services, and Food Security: Avoiding the Costs of
   Ignoring the Linkage
SO LOW CARBON PATHWAYS FOR GROWTH IN INDIA
SE India Studies in Business and Economics
AB This paper talks of the emerging paradigm of water management that acknowledges critical ecosystem services, and challenges the linear and positive relation between water availability and food security. The ways water used to be managed, globally, are changing rapidly. The existing engineering modes of water management entail constructing large structures intervening into the natural hydrological flows, and exploiting the water for human use. A large component of demand for water emerged from the need of the agricultural sector in various parts of the developing and developed world to ensure food security. Over time, the developed nations began realizing that such traditional engineering ways of water management entailing large constructions are not sustainable in the long run, and can have serious impacts on ecosystems. Since large parts of livelihoods are dependent on the ecosystem services, negative impacts on ecosystems affect livelihoods negatively, too. Hence, a new paradigm of water management recognizing the ecosystems livelihoods linkages is emerging. This new paradigm is known as Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and, when applied at the level of a river basin, is referred to as Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM). This new paradigm delinks economic growth and food security from increasing water use, and provides for an ecosystemic definition of food security. However, this changing paradigm is yet to be recognized in policy documents of the developing world, especially India. For India to embark upon a low-carbon growth trajectory, it must embrace the new paradigm of water management.

AB We present a modeling approach for generating robust predictions about how changes in institutional, economic, and political considerations will influence the outcome of political negotiations over complex water-ecosystem policy debates. Evaluating the political viability of proposed policies is challenging for researchers in these complex natural and political environments; there is limited information with which to map policies to outcomes to utilities or to represent the political process adequately. Our analysis evaluates the viability of policy options using a probabilistic political viability criterion that explicitly recognizes the existence of modeling uncertainty. The approach is used to conduct a detailed case study of the future of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Several other possible applications of the approach are briefly discussed.

TI Food-Web and Ecosystem Structure of the Open-Ocean and Deep-Sea
   Environments of the Azores, NE Atlantic
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The Marine Strategy Framework Directive intends to adopt ecosystem-based management for resources, biodiversity and habitats that puts emphasis on maintaining the health of the ecosystem alongside appropriate human use of the marine environment, for the benefit of current and future generations. Within the overall framework of ecosystem-based management, ecosystem models are tools to evaluate and gain insights in ecosystem properties. The low data availability and complexity of modeling deep-water ecosystems has limited the application of ecosystem models to few deep-water ecosystems. Here, we aim to develop an ecosystem model for the deep-sea and open ocean in the Azores exclusive economic zone with the overarching objective of characterizing the food-web and structure of the ecosystem. An ecosystem model with 45 functional groups, including a detritus group, two primary producer groups, eight invertebrate groups, 29 fish groups, three marine mammal groups, a turtle and a seabird group was built. Overall data quality measured by the pedigree index was estimated to be higher than the mean value of all published models. Therefore, the model was built with source data of an overall reasonable quality, especially considering the normally low data availability for deep-sea ecosystems. The total biomass (excluding detritus) of the modeled ecosystem for the whole area was calculated as 24.7 t km(-2). The mean trophic level for the total marine catch of the Azores was estimated to be 3.95, similar to the trophic level of the bathypelagic and medium-size pelagic fish. Trophic levels for the different functional groups were estimated to be similar to those obtained with stable isotopes and stomach contents analyses, with some exceptions on both ends of the trophic spectra. Omnivory indices were in general low, indicating prey speciation for the majority of the groups. Cephalopods, pelagic sharks and toothed whales were identified as groups with key ecological roles in the ecosystem. Due to concerns on the use of ecosystem models with low confidence in exploring management decisions and ecological theories, the current version of this model should only be use with caution until biomass estimates are validated with survey data or the model is fitted to time series.

TI Assessing Potential Effects of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) on Water
   Ecosystem Service in the Interurban Micro-Watershed Rio Torres, Costa
   Rica
SO FORESTS
AB The implementation of green infrastructure (GI) as Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) generates positive effects on the water ecosystem service in an urban context. Practices such as bioretention cells, green roofs, rain gardens, permeable pavements, and infiltration trenches contribute to treating large volumes of runoff and providing safe spaces for populations living in highly urbanized areas. With the aim to simulate these effects, a hydrological modeling was carried out using the i-Tree Hydro Plus model, which quantified the runoff generated from precipitation events and effective transformations (NBS) to cope with runoff. Eight scenarios were developed: a baseline scenario, five future scenarios with green infrastructure, a scenario with increased tree coverage, and a scenario with increased urbanization. Our hypothesis is that NBS would reduce runoff and increase permeable flow. The analysis of the feasibility of implementing the modeled green infrastructures was carried out through consultation with local stakeholders in the micro-watershed. We found that bioretention cells decrease runoff by 5%, green roofs by 4%, rain gardens by 4%, permeable pavements by 4.5%, and infiltration trenches by 7.5% compared to the baseline scenario where runoff accounts for 32% of water balance flows. The scenario of increased tree coverage had a similar behavior to the baseline scenario, indicating that efforts in this alternative would generate a limited impact on the reduction of runoff. With increased urbanization, impermeable flow increases up to 78%, which would generate floods. Implementing NBS would be feasible since this type of initiative is included in the agenda of many regulatory instruments of urban planning in Costa Rica.

TI Co-inducible Catabolism of 2-Naphthol Initiated by Hydroxylase CehC1C2
   in Rhizobium sp. X9 Removed Its Ecotoxicity
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB 2-Naphthol, which originates from various industrial activities, is widely disseminated through the discharge of industrial wastewater and is, thus, harmful to the water ecosystem, agricultural production, and human health. In this study, the carbaryl degrading strain Rhizobium sp. X9 was proven to be able to degrade 2-naphthol and reduce its toxicity to rice (Oryza sativa) and Chlorella ellipsoidea. Two-component hydroxylase CehC1C2 is responsible for the initial step of degradation and generates 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, which is further degraded by the ceh cluster. The transcription of gene cluster cehC1C2 could be induced when both 2-naphthol and glucose were added. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that two transcriptional regulators, the inhibitor CehR2 and the activator CehR3, could be involved in this process. Our study elucidated the molecular mechanism of microbial degradation of 2-naphthol and provided an effective strategy for the in situ remediation of 2-naphthol contamination in the environment.

TI Increases of opportunistic species in response to ecosystem change: the
   case of the Baltic Sea three-spined stickleback
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Under rapid environmental change, opportunistic species may exhibit dramatic increases in response to the altered conditions, and can in turn have large impacts on the ecosystem. One such species is the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), which has shown substantial increases in several aquatic systems in recent decades. Here, we review the population development of the stickleback in the Baltic Sea, a large brackish water ecosystem subject to rapid environmental change. Current evidence points to predatory release being the central driver of the population increases observed in some areas, while both eutrophication and climate change have likely contributed to creating more favourable conditions for the stickleback. The increasing stickleback densities have had profound effects on coastal ecosystem function by impairing the recruitment of piscivorous fish and enhancing the effects of eutrophication through promoting the production of filamentous algae. The increase poses a challenge for both environmental management and fisheries, where a substantial interest from the pelagic fisheries fleet in exploiting the species calls for urgent attention. While significant knowledge gaps remain, we suggest that the case of the Baltic Sea stickleback increase provides generalisable lessons of value for understanding and managing other coastal ecosystems under rapid change.

AB Cement is an essential raw material for concrete a raw material in various fields such as construction, infrastructure, and contributes 5% of the total CO2 emissions. The purpose of present study is to investigate about the potential use of fly ash which is an industrial waste along with other industrial waste cooking oil, contamination of water and destroying the water ecosystem, for the production of roof tiles. Fibre filled polymeric roofing tiles are lighter and can be easier to handle They require less maintenance and have long lasting. An excellent use of this is the use of waste materials from agro-lands for the preparation of particle-boards to be used as walls, ceilings, furniture panels and in doors. It can prove that how the value of a waste material can be significantly improved. The cement industry is among the major greenhouse gas-producing industries. Greenhouse gases are produced in two separate divisions in this industry; the first includes the cement production process and the second is power consumption. Hence, essential steps can be highly effective to reduce the amount of CO2 production in the cement production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper covers the development and research of a mathematical model for description hydrobiological processes using the modern information technologies and computational methods to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling the ecological situation in shallow waters. The model takes into account the following factors: movement of water flows; microturbulent diffusion; gravitational settling of pollutants; nonlinear interaction of phyto- and zooplankton populations; nutrient, temperature and oxygen regimes; and influence of salinity. A space splitting scheme taking into account the partial filling of cells was proposed for model discretization. This scheme significantly reduces both error and calculation time. The practical significance of the paper is determined by software implementation of the model and the determination of limits and prospects of its practical use. Experimental software is designed on the basis of a supercomputer for mathematical modeling of possible development scenarios of shallow water ecosystems taking into account the influence of environment. For this, we consider as an example the Azov Sea in summer. The parallel implementation involves decomposition methods for computationally laborious diffusion-convection problems taking into account the architecture and parameters of a multiprocessor computer system.

TI Assessing the effectiveness of surrogates for species over time:
   Evidence from decadal monitoring of a Mediterranean transitional water
   ecosystem
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The use of higher taxa or alternative approach to species surrogacy, such as the BestAgg procedure, could represent cost-effective solutions to avoid expensive species-level identifications in monitoring activities, especially on the long term. However, whether a set of surrogates would be effective in subsequent reiteration of the same assessment remains largely unsolved. We used a long-term dataset on macro-benthic assemblages to test the hypothesis that family-level and BestAgg surrogates which are effective for a limited period of monitoring could be successfully applied to quantify community patterns also in subsequent monitoring programmes. The effectiveness of surrogates in detecting temporal variations in assemblage structure as at species level remained basically unaffected over a decade. Recognizing once and for all if species surrogacy may have a practical value for monitoring will strongly depend on future assessments of the potential of surrogates to reflect community changes and to retain this prerogative over time.

TI Long-term effects of di-octyl phthalate on the expression of
   immune-related genes in Tegillarca granosa
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
AB Di-octyl phthalate (DOP) is widely used as a plasticizer in the plastics industry. As a result, DOP is often found in marine water ecosystems where many species are exposed to it. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term (14 d) DOP exposure (2.6, 7.8, or 31.2 mg/L) on the expression of immunerelated genes in Tegillarca granosa. The expression of small heat shock protein (sHSPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) were highest in clams exposed to 31.2 mg/L DOP on days 7 and 14. The relative expression of Tg-ferritin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and metallothionein (MT) increased initially then decreased as the concentration of DOP increased. The hemoglobin of T. granosa (Tg-HbI) exhibited two distinct expression patterns at two time points. Our results suggest that the immune response of T. granosa against DOP pollution varies depending on the dose. Additionally, we identified some immune-related genes that are promising candidates for biomarkers of DOP.

TI An experimental investigation of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in
   two contrasting low arctic lakes
SO POLAR BIOLOGY
AB We investigated whether phytoplankton communities in two lakes in SW Greenland were phosphorus or nitrogen limited. The study lakes have contrasting water chemistry (mean conductivities differ ten fold) and are located near Kangerlussuaq, SW Greenland (similar to 67 degrees N, 51 degrees W). A microcosm nutrient enrichment experiment was performed in June 2003 to determine whether nitrate or phosphate addition stimulated phytoplankton growth. Samples were analysed for species composition, biomass, and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). Initially, both lakes had extremely low total phosphorus but high total nitrogen concentrations and high APA, suggesting that the phytoplankton were phosphorus limited prior to the start of the experiment. The phytoplankton composition and biomass (mainly Ochromonas spp.) responded to phosphate but not to nitrate addition. In both lakes, chlorophyll a increased significantly when phosphate was added. Furthermore, APA was significantly lower in the two lakes when phosphate was added compared to the control and the nitrogen addition treatment. The dominance of mixotrophic pbytoplankton and high DOC values suggest that these lakes may be regulated by microbial loop processes.

TI Organic carbon spiraling in an Idaho river
SO AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB In running water ecosystems, the use of community attributes to infer biological integrity is widespread. In contrast, functional variables like energy flow and elemental cycling have received considerably less attention. In this study, we quantify organic carbon spiraling in four reaches of the Middle Snake River (MSR). We calculated organic carbon (OC) turnover rates (K-OC), mean velocities (V-OC), and turnover lengths (S-OC) by quantifying suspended and benthic pools of organic carbon and measuring metabolic rates using both open-system and chamber approaches. Ultra-fine particulate organic carbon (UPOC) dominated both transported and benthic OC in all study reaches. K-OC was lowest where benthic standing stocks were greatest and K-OC was elevated in summer relative to spring and fall. V-OC was negatively correlated with benthic OC standing stock and greatest in spring and early summer when river discharge was highest. Turnover lengths (S-OC) ranged from 11-108 km and were strongly related to temporal patterns in V-OC. Comparison of the Snake River with other river systems suggests that MSR is more retentive and homogeneous than rivers of similar size in North America.

This study aims to explore ways to increase the stability of the rural ecological space and promote the construction and development of green and livable villages from the perspective of spatial resilience. (2) Method: The framework for the assessment of spatial resilience for villages was constructed, the spatial resilience characteristics in Qing Yanggang were analyzed through a field investigation and qualitative analysis, and a spatial resilience planning path for the village in river and lake areas was established. (3) Results: By integrating the natural and artificial elements in rural space, the rural spatial resilience planning can reduce the sensitivity, vulnerability and potential risks of rural areas, which is an important strategy to improve rural sustainable development. (4) Conclusions: For rural areas in plain and lake areas, it is important to optimize rural land use structures, divide rural ecological resilience zones, establish ecological zoning control systems, implement water system connectivity, improve water system patterns to achieve ecological restoration, and implement the adaptive cycle of rural water ecosystem to form a rural spatial resilience planning model. In this way, the Goals n.6 of "Provide Water and Sanitation" of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be achieved at the rural scale.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
AB Urban wastewater and agriculture activities are the main sources of urban water pollution and of eutrophying nutrients in many water ecosystems. Several EU directives have been adopted and affect the control of urban water pollution. The EU legislation requires the achievement of good ecological and chemical status in all water. This paper focuses on the use of economic instruments as a priority in the context of implementation. Our analysis only considers public wastewater utilities facing demand and capacity shocks. The proposed mechanism constitutes efficient means of moving towards sustainability by promoting full-cost pricing and considering external costs from wastewater services. Environmental damage associated with urban water pollution are internalized. The model also explicitly considers the investment needed to set-up wastewater system facilities. Our results indicate that savings in capacity could be achieved by adopting the proposed incentive-based mechanism that characterizes the optimal capacity selection rule.

AB Basic knowledge of population status is effective for the conservation of many species, especially threatened and endangered species. In this study, we used the Mark-recapture technique (Lincoln-Petersen method) as an established method for estimating population in wildlife surveys. Population surveys of critically endangered newts conducted for Neurergus derjugini in the streams of Kurdistan and Kermanshah Provinces, western Iran, at Sarvabad, Marivan, Baneh, Saghez, and Nosoud. The study consists of estimating population size by sampling annually for two consecutive years with each annual sampling consisting of several surveys between May-August. The species has a restricted distribution, occurring at high mountain streams. Our results also reject the occurrence of this species in Sarvabad and Awraman stream habitats and water ecosystems as was stated by former researchers. Distribution information of this species was updated in the region, and all known records are mapped. The results showed that Miri Sour (Marivan) with 1591-1568 and Asnabad (Marivan) with 14-18 specimens as estimated populations were found as most and less populated and suitable habitats respectively.

SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The present study evaluated very small microplastic particle (MPs) transfer to zebrafish and marine medaka larvae via prey experimentally exposed to MPs from the onset of feeding. Larvae were fed Paramecium or Anemia nauplii loaded with fluorescent 1-5 or 10-20 mu m MP. Pollutant accumulation was analyzed by optically tracking of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and recording cyp1a transcription. Paramecium transferred 1-5 mu m particles only, whereas Artemia efficiently transferred both MPs. Although zebrafish and medaka larvae fed from the onset of active food intake (2-3 dph, respectively) on Paramecium and from days 6-7 post-hatch on Artemia nauplii, neither MP accumulation nor translocation to tissues was detected. MP egestion started within few hours after ingestion. Cyp1a induction and fluorescent analyses proved BaP bioavailability after transfer via Paramecium and Artemia. Unicellular or plankton organisms ingest contaminants via MPS and transfer effectively these to sensitive early life-stages of vertebrates, giving rise to whole-life exposure.

TI Toxicity, degradation and analysis of the herbicide atrazine
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Excessive use of pesticides and herbicides is a major environmental and health concern worldwide. Atrazine, a synthetic triazine herbicide commonly used to control grassy and broadleaf weeds in crops, is a major pollutant of soil and water ecosystems. Atrazine modifies the growth, enzymatic processes and photosynthesis in plants. Atrazine exerts mutagenicity, genotoxicity, defective cell division, erroneous lipid synthesis and hormonal imbalance in aquatic fauna and nontarget animals. It has threatened the sustainability of agricultural soils due to detrimental effects on resident soil microbial communities. The detection of atrazine in soil and reservoir sites is usually made by IR spectroscopy, ELISA, HPLC, UPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS techniques. HPLC/LC-MS and GC-MS techniques are considered the most effective tools, having detection limits up to ppb levels in different matrices. Biodegradation of atrazine by microbial species is increasingly being recognized as an eco-friendly, economically feasible and sustainable bioremediation strategy. This review presents the toxicity, analytical techniques, abiotic degradation and microbial metabolism of atrazine.

In this paper, a preliminary assessment of ecosystem health in Zhejiang coastal water zone was made, mainly based on remote sensing data and GIS technique. Its spatial and quantitative evaluation was facilitated by the progress of remote sensing and GIS technique development. Firstly, human activities, hydrology and ecosystem problems in the study area were discussed and analyzed. Secondly, from 4 aspects of human stress, physical, chemical and biological responses to anthropogenic activities and natural stress, several indicators such as water transparency (Secchi Disk Depth, SDD), suspended substance concentration, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, active phosphate, chlorophyll, harmful algae bloom, as well as distribution of sewage, sea lanes and port were employed. Thirdly, the Analytic Hierarchical Process was used for indicator weight calculation, and the ecosystem health criteria were established according to the integrative analysis of national water quality criteria, similar coastal ecosystem health research in other places or data inherent properties. The results indicated that from 2005 to 2007 the coastal water ecosystem health value in Zhejiang Province was unhealthy and needs ecological restoration by human intervention.

TI Bioaccumulation, detection and analyses of heavy metal pollution in
   Sultan Marsh and its environment
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Sultan Marsh is one of the largest and most important wetlands in Turkey, Middle East and Europe, embodying saline and fresh water ecosystems, which provide a shelter for 426 bird species. The area has begun to contribute much to the tourism of Kayseri state and its environs. However, the sites in the vicinity of the sewerage - sludge and fertilizer plants are highly damaged due to pollution. As such, studies on the heavy metal status of water, sediment and plants were investigated. Phragmites australis, Ranunculus sphaerosphermus plants and samples of sediments were taken from 13 different stations of this Marsh. All sampling sites in the study area basin were generally more or less polluted when compared with the control sites. Cr concentrations in the roots of the plants were higher than in the sediment. The tissues of Phragmites australis accumulated heavy metals more than those of Ranunculus sphaerosphermus. The heavy metal accumulation in different parts of plants followed the sequence: root > stem > leaf. Both plants can be used as biological indicators while determining environmental pressures; however, Phragmites australis proved more appropriate for such studies.

AB Hydro-chemical data were obtained from a shallow and deep water station in the Turkish shelf zone of the NE Mediterranean with approximately monthly intervals from January to December 2002. The shallow station (0.5 miles off the coast) is influenced directly by the small Lamas River having high nitrate (63-121 muM) and silicate (52-118 muM) values, but very low phosphate concentrations (30-760 nM). Thus, nitrate and silicate concentrations of the shallow station are extremely variable and much higher than those in the upper layer (0-50 m) of the deep station. Similarly, the phosphate concentrations, measured using the high-sensitivity magnesium-induced coprecipitation (MAGIC) method, fluctuate markedly between 20 and 180 nM in the shallow water, but vary little (15-30 nM) in the deep water samples. Particulate organic matter (POM) abundance increases markedly from the shallow to the deep station. However, chemical composition (C/N ratio) of bulk POM in the shelf waters ranges between 7 and 13, displaying small temporal fluctuations at the nutrient-depleted deep station.

SP Int Water Assoc
AB Many studies have identified the first flush phenomenon and runoff characteristics. The purpose of this study is to elucidate which parameters influence the runoff pollutant loads. Eight runoff events during the period from May 1999 to September 2000 were investigated. From the dimensionless cumulative analysis, it was suggested that particulate substances such as suspended solids (SS), iron and total phosphorus (T-P) were inclined to be washed off in heavier rainfall condition. The cumulative curves of particulate constituents were appreciably variable in slope, while those of dissolved were approximately constant. Accordingly it was indicated that dissolved load was discharged regardless of rainfall conditions. Event mean runoff intensity and cumulative runoff height showed significant correlation with the cumulative runoff load of the constituents except for total nitrogen (T-N). On the other hand, antecedent dry weather period (ADWP) and traffic flow volume during ADWP did not show correlation with the cumulative runoff loads. Only T-N load showed correlation with those factors, consequently it was suggested that vehicular exhausts affected nitrogen load on the surface of urban highway.

TI A georeferenced rRNA amplicon database of aquatic microbiomes from South

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB The biogeography of bacterial communities is a key topic in Microbial Ecology. Regarding continental water, most studies are carried out in the northern hemisphere, leaving a gap on microorganism's diversity patterns on a global scale. South America harbours approximately one third of the world's total freshwater resources, and is one of these understudied regions. To fill this gap, we compiled 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data of microbial communities across South America continental water ecosystems, presenting the first database mu SudAqua[db]. The database contains over 866 georeferenced samples from 9 different ecoregions with contextual environmental information. For its integration and validation we constructed a curated database (mu SudAqua[db.sp]) using samples sequenced by Illumina MiSeq platform with commonly used prokaryote universal primers. This comprised similar to 60% of the total georeferenced samples of the mu SudAqua[db]. This compilation was carried out in the scope of the mu SudAqua collaborative network and represents one of the most complete databases of continental water microbial communities from South America.

TI MULTISCALE MODEL FOR URBAN FLOOD CONTROL PLANNING BASED ON
   MICROCIRCULATION.
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB Flood season in our country is characterized by frequent heavy rains, and flood problems are becoming increasingly serious. The uneven distribution of water resources causes conflicts in the occurrence of floods and droughts. Implementing effective flood control planning and solving drought and flood disasters are the research highlights of relevant institutions both domestic and abroad. This study develops a multiscale method of urban flood control planning based on microcirculation. A microcirculation water ecosystem, which consists of six elements, namely, collecting, interacting, precipitating, reserving, storing, and purifying, is introduced. This study investigates precipitation; peak shaving; recycle mode of filtration at the macro level in different regions; "hierarchy" in rainwater ecosystems in rain parks, heavy rain garden parks, and wetland parks at the rneso level; and the concept of zero-emission rain in residential areas and roads at the micro level. Finally, this study analyzes a rain garden and its domestic application. A conclusion is drawn that the flood control planning model based on microcirculation can effectively reduce rain runoff. Empirical measurement proves that the proposed multiscale model for city flood control planning based on microcirculation promotes flood control and effectively reduces the occurrence of droughts and floods.

SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB Nanopartides (NPs) are being used in many industries ranging from medical, textile, automobile, consumer products, etc. This may increase the probability of their (NPs) release into the environment and fresh water ecosystems. The present study focuses on testing the potential effect of iron oxide, nanocomposite of cadmium sulfide and silver sulfide, cadmium sulfide and silver sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) on a fresh water alga Mougeotia sp. as the model organism. The alga was treated with different concentrations of NPs (0.1-25 mg/L). The NPs exposure caused lipid peroxidation and ROS production, and suppressed the antioxidant defense system such as catalase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase. Adsorption of NPs on algal surface and membrane damage were confirmed through microscopic evaluation and increase in protein content in extracellular medium. The present investigation pointed out the ecological implications of NPs. The study warrants the need for regulatory agencies to monitor and regulate the use of NPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SO ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
AB Despite the worldwide distribution and ecological importance of Chironomus larvae in both freshwater and brackish water ecosystems, patterns of their spatial distribution have been rarely studied. This study was conducted in summer, spring and autumn (2010-2011) in the deep-water zone of the polymictic, strongly eutrophic Vistula Lagoon. Its objective was to test whether temporal changes in density of the larvae affect their horizontal microdistribution and burrowing depth. Horizontal distribution, as inferred from indices of dispersion and patchiness, was density-dependent. The larvae spread more regularly with increasing density. The decreased density was associated with an increase in clustered distribution. The larvae burrowed into sediments up to a depth of 25 cm. The maximum burrowing depth positively correlated with total density, but also depended on the size of the larvae. The smallest individuals (<10 mm) did not occur deeper than 5 cm. Larger larvae were encountered throughout the sediment profile. The largest larvae did not always burrow the deepest. In spring before pupation, the larvae gathered below the sediment surface.

SO ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI
AB The seasonal dynamics of the biomass, elongation growth and primary production rate of the green alga Chara tomentosa were measured in Rame Bay (NE Baltic Sea) during the vegetation period of 2002. The measurements showed extremely high plant height (up to 142 cm) and biomass values (5.2 kg(w.w.) m(-2)), indicating the importance of C. tomentosa for the whole coastal water ecosystem. The apical part of the thallus grew more intensively from early spring to midsummer. The growth rate of the subapical section was very low during the entire observation period. The plant's diurnal net primary production rate peaked in July (43.4 mgO g(d.w.)(-1) 24h(-1)); remarkably lower rates were measured in May and September. The elongation growth and primary production were not correlated with water nutrient concentrations and water temperature. As the active growth of C. tomentosa takes place during a relatively short period at the beginning of summer, the amount of available solar radiation and the temperature levels during this sensitive time can have a significant effect on the community in the same year.

SO VETERINARNI MEDICINA
AB Contents of total mercury and mercury species (methylmercury - MeHg, inorganic mercury - Hg2+) were determined in four Moravian rivers - Jihlava, Becva, Loucka and Dyje (Czech Republic). Five tissues (muscle, gills, liver, kidney and skin) of chub (Leuciscus cephalus), zoobenthos, sediments and water samples were analyzed. Time stability of samples was also tested. The highest levels of total mercury were determined in muscle tissues of all tested fish. Relative contents of MeHg in muscle tissues of fish ranged from 83.6% to 92.0% of the total mercury contents. The relative contents of MeHg in sediments and in zoobenthos samples correlate very closely (correlation coefficient -0.83). A considerably lower content of MeHg (1.3-11.4%) was found in river sediments compared with lakes. A comparison of observed sampling sites (Vladislav, Hrubsice) proved the adverse effect of industrial contamination on the water ecosystem of Jihlava River and incomplete removal of mercury species in a sewage station.

SO DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
AB Bacterial disease outbreaks in filter feeder bivalve Hyriopsis cumingii as water contamination become more frequent in the water ecosystem, especially in intensive aquaculture habitats. To characterize host-pathogen interactions between H. cumingii and bacterial infection, we investigated the effects of Stenotrophomonas mal-tophilia HOP3 and Aeromonas veronii GL1 on the antioxidant response, tissue invasion and transcriptome expression of H. cumingii by infectivity trials. We showed that bacterial infections resulted in tubular necrosis of the hepatopancreas and induced the acute immune response in H. cumingii. The transcriptomic study identified a total of 5957 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after A. veronii challenge. These DEGs were implicated in 302 KEGG pathways, notably in Apoptosis, Phagosome and Lysosome. The results showed that the relative expres-sions of all six immune-related DEGs were effectively stimulated with A. veronii, accompanied by tissue differ-ences. Overall, these findings will contribute to an analysis of the immune response of H. cumingii to bacterial infection at the transcriptomic level and its genomic resource for research.

TI Environmental Fate of Neonicotinoids and Classification of Their
   Potential Risks to Hypogean, Epygean, and Surface Water Ecosystems in
   Brazil
SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Due to their reported high toxicity to honey bees, ecotoxicological studies into the side-effects of neonicotinoid insecticides have focused almost exclusively on these organisms. The fate of neonicotinoids and potential toxic side-effects on other (especially non-standard) organisms have received considerably less attention. In the present study, the environmental distribution and leaching potential of neonicotinoids registered for agricultural use in Brazil (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were studied by applying several environmental fate models and indices. Potential risks to various environmental compartments were evaluated by applying ranking indices to the maximum application rates recommended in Brazil. Although bees were indeed found to be the most sensitive organism, the neonicotinoids also indicated potential environmental risks to other organism groups. Due to the greater maximum application rates recommended in Brazil as compared to other parts of the world, environmental risk and resistance potential for at least imidacloprid appears especially high in Brazil. Attention should thus also be allocated to organisms other than bees and to resistance potential when performing an environmental risk assessment of neonicotinoids if they are used at relatively high application rates.

SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Organic microfossils of a well-dated sediment core from Gotland Basin were analysed and used for the ecological interpretation of the Holocene history of this area. To avoid confusion with corrected and uncorrected C-14 ages, only calendar years BP are used. In the lowermost part organic microfossils are rare, but few marine dinoflagellate cysts between 11300 and 11000 years BP indicate the marine Yoldia Phase. At 9800 years BP a significant environmental change is indicated by the rapid increase of freshwater dinoflagellates and pine pollen. At the end of the freshwater stage an enormous abundance increase of cladoceran remains indicates an eutrophication event between 7600 and 7400 years BP. First permanent brackish water conditions of the surface water were established at 7400 years BP and the increasing salinity reached its maximum between 6700 and 6400 years BP. Further changes in the brackish surface water ecosystem of the Gotland Basin can be found at 5500, 4400, 3000, 1000, and 800 years BP, which are thought to be mainly climatically induced.

TI New approaches to the ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB So as to assess how emerging science and new tools can be applied to study multiple stressors at a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines, a workshop was organised on 10-12 September 2014 at the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Sydney, Australia. The present paper discusses the limitations of the current risk-assessment approaches and how multiple stressors at large scales can be better evaluated in ecological risk assessments to inform the development of more efficient and preventive management policies based on adaptive management in the future. A future risk-assessment paradigm that overcomes these limitations is presented. This paradigm includes cultural and ecological protection goals, the development of ecological scenarios, the establishment of the relevant interactions among species, potential sources of stressors, their interactions and the development of cause-effect models. It is envisaged that this will be achievable through a greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines and through the application of new and emerging tools such as 'big data', ecological modelling and the incorporation of ecosystem service endpoints.

TI Heavy metal ion removal of wastewater by zeolite-imidazolate frameworks
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB With the rapid development of industrialization, removing heavy metal ions of wastewater from the discharge of industrial sewage is a very important topic, because it will severely affect our environment and water ecosystem. In this work, we synthesize two porous adsorbents of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 and further investigate their performance of removing Pb2+ and Cu2+ from wastewater. Results indicate that saturated adsorption capacities of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 for Pb2+ reach 1119.80 and 1348.42 mg/g, while they are 454.72 and 617.51 mg/g for Cu2+, respectively, which are greatly higher than almost all other porous materials. If we use the excessive adsorbents to treat wastewater, more than 99.4% Pb2+ and 97.4% Cu2+ can be removed by ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 adsorbents. Moreover, the two adsorbents also show fast adsorption kinetics, and only need several decade minutes to reach adsorption equilibrium. These features indicate that ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 are excellent candidates for removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater.

TI Evaluation of Plecoptera (Insecta) community composition using
   multivariate technics in a biodiversity hotspot
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is a sub-ecoregion of the Caucasus Ecoregion, and its Plecoptera fauna is similar to fauna of Caucasus with unique endemic species of the region. The Caucasus Ecoregion is one of the "WWF Global 200 Ecoregions," and it is also included in the list of top 25 hotspots in the World. Running water ecosystems of Eastern Black Sea sub-ecoregion are the most sensitive to land use change and global climate change. High-altitude aquatic ecosystems are more strongly threatened by global climate change in the region. Plecoptera constitute the most important part of the biodiversity of running waters in the region. Among the benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, Plecoptera is the best indicator of ecological conditions of running waters. The influence of environmental variables on the distribution of twenty Plecoptera species in running water ecosystems (headwaters, crenon, epirhithron, metarhithron) was assessed using canonical correspondence analysis. Sampling was carried out in 2009 and 2011. Eleven end groups were generated from the TWINSPAN analysis. Isoperla rhododendri, Isoperla grammatica, Protonemura bifida, Protonemura eumontana and Perla caucasica were closely related to pH, dissolved oxygen and riparian vegetation. Brachyptera transcaucasica transcaucasica, Nemoura martynovia, Nemoura taurica and Protonemura eumontana were related to Mg and Cu. The results show that the Plecoptera assemblage composition was affected by DO, pH, EC, temperature, nitrite, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Al, riparian vegetation, altitude and stream width.

AB The world is moving towards a dangerous situation of societal instability due to our failing ability to manage the life support, system on the human-dominated planet. Contributing to this problem are inherited and biased ways of thinking, originating from the 17th century and based on fragmentation and sectorization. A fundamental shift in thinking is therefore needed urgently, to better bridge, the partial realities addressed tip until now. Awareness has to be built up around the need for societal adaptation to hydroclimatic constraints, and strong enough institutions must be developed, capable of supporting unpopular decisions. A proper conceptualization is badly needed of the life support system in a science of 'environmentology', in which water is acknowledged as the bloodstream of the biosphere. Both land/water linkages and water/ecosystem linkages will have to be properly entered into an integrated and catchment-based land/water/ecosystem approach. The goal has to meet both societal needs and environmental sustainabhity conditions. Attention will have to be paid to all water, both liquid blue water, supporting humanity and aquatic ecosystems, and vapour-form green water, supporting terrestrial ecosystems, agriculture and forestry. The economic resource will have to be seen as the precipitation over the basin. Both water-dependent and water-impacting activities and ecosystems in the basin have to be analysed. Joint attention will have to be paid to environmental security, water security and food security. Methods for compromise building between incompatible water-related interests and ecosystems will have to be developed. Societal acceptance will depend on awareness campaigns-make water everybody's business-and has to be secured by participation. A new ethics of hydrosolidarity will have to be developed between those living upstream and those living downstream in a river basin.

TI Extreme drought events can promote homogenization of benthic
   macroinvertebrate assemblages in a floodplain pond in Brazil
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Extreme weathers tend to become frequent following global warming and may promote important changes in species composition. We used benthic macroinvertebrates to test the hypothesis that extreme drought events could lead to local biotic homogenization in a floodplain pond. We took sediment samples in three sampling areas of a floodplain pond during a period of the usual hydrological cycle and during an extreme weather event that caused an atypical hydrological cycle with prolonged drought period. We found that community composition significantly differs between usual hydrological cycle and extreme drought periods, in which only species adapted to unfavorable environmental conditions remained. The spatial beta diversity decreased during the extreme drought periods, presenting lower variability compared to the usual hydrological cycle. However, species density, richness, and diversity increased during the droughts. We expect that, in scenarios of climate change with frequent extreme weathers, droughts may cause permanent negative impacts on aquatic communities, leading to biotic homogenization. Moreover, our findings indicate that prolonged droughts could increase the time needed to community recovery, suggesting lower community resilience to environmental stressors. Therefore, increasing frequency of extreme drought events may result in an alternative community structure.

AB Toxic chemicals introduced into the environment can penetrate ecosystems and can be found in the whole biosphere. Chemical contamination may affect ecosystems, causing changes in the functions of particular organisms. Adverse effects of xenobiotics and their metabolites on living organisms can be observed. In the last few years investigations have focused on searching for bioindicators (both plant and animal organisms) that accumulate toxic substances. The aim of the present study was to discuss selected methods of environmental quality assessment based on living organisms used as bioindicators, paying special attention to water ecosystems.

AB Chongming Island is the world's largest alluvial island, in which river ecosystem is a major component of the terrestrial surface water ecosystem. Using the methods of environmental economics, such as market valuation method, shadow engineering method and protection costs method, the values of river ecosystem services in Chongming Island were assessed. We find that the total services values are 136.415 billion $/yr. The values of various services are ordered as: water storage> water supply> aquatic product>gas regulation>water purification>transporting sediment>flood control > travelling and recreation > research and education > shipping > habitat > soil formation. The results indicate that water storage is the main service but water supply is the core service; habitat and travelling & recreation have lower values, which should be improved. We conclude that river management should consider the characteristic of overall usefulness of ecosystem to optimize all the services in the future, ascending river ecosystem management.

TI A methodology for ranking potential pollution caused by abandoned mining
   wastes: application to sulfide mine tailings in Mazarron (Southeast
   Spain)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Mining wastes often contain high concentrations of toxic elements, whose mobility and dispersion may pose an environmental hazard for soils, water, ecosystems and people. This article describes the partial application of a methodology designed to evaluate the pollution potential of abandoned mining wastes, using two indices for potential pollution evaluation: an index of contamination (IC) and a hazard average quotient (CPP). Composite samples, consisting of at least 30 subsamples, were taken at three sulfidic tailings impoundments in the mining area of Mazarron (SE Spain). Mineralogical, physical, and chemical characteristics were analyzed: color, particle size, powder XRD analysis, pH, total content of toxic elements, and concentrations in leachates by the standard procedure EN-12457-2. Tailings were extremely acid (pH 2.30-2.52). Some ranges of total content (in mg/kg) were: As (381-565), Pb (2602-4487), Sb (139-170), and Zn (3254-5652). The concentration measured in the EN-12457 leachates (mu g/L) was as high as 367,000 for Zn, 2030 for Cu, and 974 for Cd. The IC and CPP values were among the most high of the tailings inventoried in Spain. The combination of the indices provided a good estimation of the potential toxicity of these wastes, and it can be useful to rank abandoned mining waste facilities.

TI Partitioning characteristics of heavy metals in a non-tidal freshwater
   ecosystem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Trace metals in the aquatic environment have to date come essentially from naturally occurring geochemical resources. However, this has been enhanced by anthropogenic activities resulting in pollution. Consequently, correlations and partitioning of trace metals in the dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments were investigated in five selected sites along the Taylor Creek, southern Nigeria. The degree of correlations between the various metals was different in each of the investigated matrices. In the matrices studied, not many significant correlations (P<0.05) were recognized. Only Ni-Cd (r=0.95), Mn-Cd (r=0.63), Mn-Ni (r=0.64) are correlated in the sediments and in SPM, Fe-Cr (r=0.54) and Zn-Ni (r=0.72), which suggests that the sources are not common for both matrices. In the dissolved phase, no strong correlations (P<0.05) between the trace metals are obvious. The best correlations are observed for Ni-Zn (r=0.72) and Cd-Pb (r=0.65). Partitioning coefficients (K(d)) of trace metals between dissolved phase and SPM are generally low, which is typical for fresh water ecosystems and fairly stable over the creek all through the seasons. Thus, the state of the aquatic ecosystem indicates that the trace metals, which are bio-accumulatable, could contribute to inferior biodiversity and shifts in community composition from sensitive to tolerant taxa.

TI Sorption of 71 Pharmaceuticals to Powder Activated Carbon for Improved
   Wastewater Treatment
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, sorption distribution coefficients were determined for 71 pharmaceuticals, aiming to describe their sorption behavior to powder activated carbon (PAC). The data are expected to be applied when designing and upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for improved removal of pharmaceuticals by applying sorption to PAC as an additional removal technique. Sorption isotherms were determined for the pharmaceuticals over a concentration interval covering a wide range from 0.08 to 10 mu g/L using PAC at a concentration of 10 mg/L. The best fitted sorption isotherms were used to calculate the distribution coefficients (K-d) and these were applied to estimate that the PAC doses needed to achieve a target concentration of 10 ng/L in the effluent. A target concentration was used since neither discharge limit values nor environmental quality standards in general have been defined for these compounds. Using a %-removal approach does not guarantee achievement of concentrations low enough to protect the water ecosystems. Some of the pharmaceuticals will be reduced by the addition of small amounts of PAC. Examples are atenolol, carbamazepine, citalopram, codeine, fluoxetine and ibuprofen. For others, e.g., oxazepam, an alternative treatment has to be considered since the requested dose is too high to be realistic for a target concentration of 10 ng/L.

   in a wetland area (La Bassee, France)
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Understanding water exchange between groundwater and streams, or groundwater/surface-water relationships, is of primary importance for solving conflicts related to water use and for restoring water ecosystems. To this end, a combination of classic geochemical tools and isotopic tools were tested on the Bassee study site, located in the alluvial plain of the River Seine, to see whether they are relevant for tracing multiple and complex groundwater/surface-water relationships. The Ca/Sr ratio associated with Sr isotopes shows contrasted values and suggests that infiltration of surface water to groundwater increases when approaching the Seine. Furthermore, stable isotopes of the water molecule indicate that water from gravel-pit lakes may infiltrate into groundwater. Tritium and CFC tools confirmed surface-water influence on the Alluvial and Chalk aquifers. This geochemical approach, tested on the Bassee site, clearly demonstrates the need of using various geochemical tools for describing groundwater/surface-water relationships, and can be conclusively addressed to other case studies for helping decision makers in their management of natural water resources.

TI Invasive quagga mussels can be attenuated by redear sunfish (Lepomis

SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB The degree to which invasive quagga mussels have spread across the Southwestern United States is unprecedented, and until now, none of the controls currently available is risk-free to the environment or human health. Here we demonstrate that stocking high-density (0.42 fish/m(3) or 1.90 fish/m(2)) redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) in an infested lake enclosure removed adult quagga mussels efficiently and appeared to suppress their growth and recruitment. However, mussels were not eradicated during the short term experimental course. Long-term study needs to be conducted to determine whether mussels can be completely eliminated by redear sunfish and what optimum density would be required for balancing high efficacy mussel control with cost-effectiveness. Redear sunfish is a species native to the Southeastern United States that has become a popular, stocked sportfish in the Southwest. Targeted stocking of redear sunfish may be an efficient and environmentally friendly approach to mitigate the colonization of invasive quagga mussels in suitable open water ecosystems, especially those with new dreissenid infestations or those threatened by invasion.

TI A combined microbial and biogeochemical dataset from high-latitude

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB High latitudes are experiencing intense ecosystem changes with climate warming. The underlying methane (CH4) cycling dynamics remain unresolved, despite its crucial climatic feedback. Atmospheric CH4 emissions are heterogeneous, resulting from local geochemical drivers, global climatic factors, and microbial production/consumption balance. Holistic studies are mandatory to capture CH4 cycling complexity. Here, we report a large set of integrated microbial and biogeochemical data from 387 samples, using a concerted sampling strategy and experimental protocols. The study followed international standards to ensure inter-comparisons of data amongst three high-latitude regions: Alaska, Siberia, and Patagonia. The dataset encompasses different representative environmental features (e.g. lake, wetland, tundra, forest soil) of these high-latitude sites and their respective heterogeneity (e.g. characteristic microtopographic patterns). The data included physicochemical parameters, greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions, organic matter characterization, trace elements and nutrients, isotopes, microbial quantification and composition. This dataset addresses the need for a robust physicochemical framework to conduct and contextualize future research on the interactions between climate change, biogeochemical cycles and microbial communities at high-latitudes.

SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY
AB The state of waters in Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan, and Nha Trang Bay, South China Sea, has been assessed according to the following microbiological parameters at the sites that differ in their degrees of anthropogenic impact: spectra of substrate consumption determined by the method of multi-substrate testing (MST) and the abundance of some indicator bacteria. The results of mathematical processing of the spectra of substrate consumption by microorganisms in the studied waters showed the main characteristics of secure well-functioning water ecosystems and systems under the influence of external factors. The cleanest water sites were characterized by the maximum values of the ecosystem health index and the minimum values of the number of conditionally pathogenic bacteria. Consequently, the data obtained through determination of the spectra of substrate consumption by marine microflora reflect the actual ecological and epidemiological situation in the water area and can be used in monitoring of marine waters.

AB Mixotrophy is a common phenomenon among planktonic algae and protozoa. Mixotrophic protists that combine phagotrophy and phototrophy are often abundant in the euphotic zone in fresh, estuarine and oceanic waters. Mixotrophy can be important in waters ranging from eutrophic to oligotrophic and from polar to tropical. Mixotrophic protists differ both qualitatively and quantitatively in their dependence on feeding, light and uptake of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Conceptual models for six physiological types of mixotrophs are presented. Functional relationships of phototrophy and phagotrophy to the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients, light and particulate food are predicted for each model. The hypothetical costs of phototrophy and phagotrophy in mixotrophic protists as well as the possible ecological and evolutionary implications of these costs are described. The probable effects of mixotrophy on gross growth efficiency, productivity of the microbial food web and coupling of the microbial food web to metazoan zooplankton are discussed.

TI Next-Generation Smart Response Web (NG-SRW): An Operational Spatial
   Decision Support System for Maritime Oil Spill Emergency Response in the
   Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea)
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Baltic Sea is a unique and sensitive brackish-water ecosystem vulnerable to damage from shipping activities. Despite high levels of maritime safety in the area, there is a continued risk of oil spills and associated harmful environmental impacts. Achieving common situational awareness between oil spill response decision makers and other actors, such as merchant vessel and Vessel Traffic Service center operators, is an important step to minimizing detrimental effects. This paper presents the Next-Generation Smart Response Web (NG-SRW), a web-based application to aid decision making concerning oil spill response. This tool aims to provide, dynamically and interactively, relevant information on oil spills. By integrating the analysis and visualization of dynamic spill features with the sensitivity of environmental elements and value of human uses, the benefits of potential response actions can be compared, helping to develop an appropriate response strategy. The oil spill process simulation enables the response authorities to judge better the complexity and dynamic behavior of the systems and processes behind the potential environmental impact assessment and thereby better control the oil combat action.

TI Heat and hypoxia give a global invader, Gambusia holbrooki, the edge
   over a threatened endemic fish on Australian floodplains
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Deciphering the mechanisms by which climate change interacts with invasive species to affect biodiversity is a major challenge of global change biology. We conducted experiments to determine whether the global invader, Gambusia holbrooki, was more resistant to high water temperature (heat) and low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) than a threatened native fish, Nannoperca australis. Metabolic experiments conducted at 25 and 29 degrees C showed that G. holbrooki had at least four times the capacity for metabolic depression during hypoxia than N. australis. An increase in environmental temperature from 25 to 29 degrees C had no significant impact on the critical oxygen tension, P-crit, of G. holbrooki, but significantly and strongly increased P-crit of N. australis. Gambusia holbrooki also had a lower Q(10) of standard metabolic rate than N. australis. Our results indicate that G. holbrooki have physiological traits conferring greater resistance to hypoxia than N. australis, and as temperature increases, the resistance of N. australis to hypoxia was more eroded than that of G. holbrooki. Intensive monitoring of the temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics of wetlands showed that contemporary heat waves are already causing conditions that might give G. holbrooki the edge over N. australis on Australian floodplains. Our study adds weight to recent anecdotal reports of drought and heat waves causing localised extinction of N. australis, but the proliferation of G. holbrooki.

TI Tropical red alga Compsopogon caeruleus: an indicator of thermally
   polluted waters of Europe in the context of temperature and oxygen
   requirements
SO ALGAE
AB The red alga Compsopogon caeruleus can generally be found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. In addition to its natural habitats, this species may be found in waters that receive abnormally hot water, e.g., from powerhouses. To date, the presence of C. caeruleus has not been observed in thermally polluted lacustrine ecosystems in Poland, which has a moderate climate. The thalli of this red alga were found growing on Vallisneria spiralis in Lichenskie Lake. Impor-tantly, this paper presents a previously unknown relationship between the temperature (20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C) and oxygen requirements of C. caeruleus (based on ex situ measurements of O2 consumption by thalli). Surprisingly, 35 degrees C can be the optimum temperature for C. caeruleus, and this temperature is higher than the values reported by some previous thermal analyses by approximately 10 degrees C. Additionally, we reviewed and mapped the distribution of this nonnative and mesophilic red alga in natural / seminatural water ecosystems in Europe. Finally, we propose that the occurrence of C. caeruleus mature thalli can be a novel, simple and easy-to-recognize bioindicator of artificially and permanently heated waters in moderate climate zones by a regular discharge of postindustrial water.

TI The presence of fine sand in the muddy sediments affects habitat
   selection and accelerates the growth rate of Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri
   and Limnodrilus claparedianus (Oligochaeta)
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Assessment of food conditions for animals is usually based on the quality and quantity of available food, whereas less attention is paid to other factors affecting the processing of ingested food. One of the commonly used mechanisms involving non-digestible objects from the environment is lithophagy (using swallowed stones or sand grains as gastroliths). Therefore, the aim of this laboratory study was to investigate the impact of sand present in muddy bottom sediments on ubiquitous freshwater oligochaetes: Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Limnodrilus claparedianus. They belong to the most common tubificid species and, as detritivores, play crucial role in the functioning of water ecosystems. We showed that the presence of sand in the environment has positive effects on oligochaete habitat preferences and growth. They selected the mixture of mud and 60-160 mu m sand over pure mud and mud with larger sand fractions. Their growth rate was highest in the sediments with an admixture of this sand fraction, and simultaneously the largest number of sand grains of this size was found in their digestive tracts. In our opinion, the oligochaetes used the sand grains to grind the ingested food, which should accelerate digestion and nutrient assimilation, and stimulate their growth rate.

TI STUDY OF THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY AS AN INDICATOR OF THE TROPHIC STATUS
   OF RESERVOIRS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
AB Over the past thirty years human activity has become increasingly uncontrolled. As a result, the whole water ecosystem is transforming. Unlike natural water bodies, artificial water bodies are characterized by higher rates of eutrophication. The current paper defines the chorological structure and biomass of zooplankton communities in the reservoirs of the Chelyabinsk region. It reveals the influence of the ecological continuum on the formation of the chorological structure of zooplankton in artificial reservoirs. The given research shows that the total biomass of the representatives of the studied groups of zooplankton in eutrophic reservoirs is two times less than in mesotrophic. These are the signs that indicate biocenoses degradation. An increasing anthropogenic load has changed the chorological structure of zooplankton communities in water bodies. The obtained results show that the proportion of Cladocera in mesotrophic reservoirs is higher than in eutrophic. The Rotifera group is more common in eutrophic reservoirs than in mesotrophic ones. Copepods are common to all water bodies. Six taxons out of the predominant are registered as belonging to the dominant complex (D. cucullata, D. pulex, D. longispinae, Eudiaptomus graciloides, Thermocyclops oithonoides, Cyclops vicinus). D. cucullata is the only that is registered as a part of the dominant complex in the vast majority of study periods and spreads as a dominant in five reservoirs.

TI Effectiveness Assessment of a New System of Sediment Trap in the
   Investigation of Matter Sedimentation in a Reservoir-A Case Study
SO HYDROLOGY
AB This paper presents results of the research on the effectiveness of entrapping sediment matter in newly designed sediment traps. Four traps, characterized by different geometrical and construction parameters, were analyzed. The assessment of the operation of the traps was made on the basis of research work conducted in situ in a small retention reservoir located in Blizne, south-east Poland during summer 2017 and 2018. Under environmental conditions present during the research, trap number 2 emerged as the most effective. It was characterized by a height to diameter ratio equal to 6.06, as well as innovative design thanks to the presence of a dual-chamber cylindrical vessel with a sedimentation funnel ending in a deflector. The proposed construction solution ensured optimal, stable operation of the trap. This trap is more effective in entrapping sediment matter than the simple tools described in the literature so far. In addition, it can be used not only in reservoirs, but also in seas and oceans. Such traps can be used to study the sedimentation rate in various water ecosystems, and also the entrapped sediment can be analysed in a qualitative manner to determine its role in the distribution of pollutants deposited in the sediments of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Since the end of 1980s complex interdisciplinary research has been conducted in Russia concerning the work out and usage of cryotechnologies alongside with biological development and population genetics methods for preserving biodiversity, genetic funds of natural and artificial plants and animals populations, their reproduction's stabilization. Such an approach was initially introduced by russian scientists B.N. Veprintsev and N.N. Rott and was realized in a scientific -technical program "Low temperature genetic bank of industrial, rare and endangered species of fish and water invertebrates" ("Fish cryobank", 1990-1996). It was used as a basis for the conception "Preservation of hydrobionts' biodiversity using cryoconservation methods" (1997), which other reseachers apply and today in the new works. Taking into account the ongoing growth of man-made pressure on water ecosystems, the increasing tempo of hydrobionts' natural populations degradation, the great importance of water bioresources for supplying the increasing Earth's population with food and raw materials, it's necessary to have new complex state and international programs for the fastest solutions to these problems and creation of low temperature genetic bank nets. Russia has proposed before to the Comission C1 of International Cold Institution (IIR, Paris) to include preservation of plants and animals genetic resources using cryotechnologies into strategic planning of its activity.

TI Microbial abundance patterns along a transparency gradient suggest a
   weak coupling between heterotrophic bacteria and flagellates in
   eutrophic shallow Pampean lakes
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB The aim of this work was to study the components of the microbial food web and the degree of coupling between heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and heterotrophic flagellates (HF) in different shallow lakes of the Pampa Plain over a wide range of water transparency and nutrient levels. We hypothesized that not all microorganisms (i.e., HB, HF) equally increase with nutrient levels, thus, resulting in a weaker degree of coupling between HB and HF in more eutrophic waters. During the spring-summer 2009-2011, we sampled 40 Pampean lakes situated in different watershed of Buenos Aires Province. Abundances of most microbial components were very high, even higher than those reported in the literature. HB as well as picocyanobacteria (Pcy) increases with trophic state, while no clear relationship was found between protist (HF or ciliates) and Chl-a concentrations or nutrient levels. Photosynthetic picoplankton was generally dominated by phycocyanin-rich Pcy. Lakes with high HB and low HF were abundant, which suggest these components were weakly coupled. Based on the abundance of microorganisms, we do not accumulate enough evidence to segregate Pampean lakes into two discrete groups (clear vs turbid).

TI Resistance, resilience, and community dynamics in mediterranean-climate
   streams
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers) are subjected to sequential, yet contrasting hydrologic disturbances of drying and flooding. Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.

TI Photosynthetic picoplankton dynamics in Lake Tahoe: temporal and spatial
   niche partitioning among prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
SO JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
AB Dynamics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton were investigated over a 2-year time period using flow cytometry and combined with an in situ experiment in Lake Tahoe, USA to better characterize to which extent environmental factors control these communities. Pronounced seasonal patterns and clear temporal and spatial partitioning were observed between picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes. Picocyanobacteria dominated in the nutrient deficient upper water column during the stratified season, while picoeukaryotes reached maximum abundance during isothermal conditions and maintained high numbers in deep-water layers during the stratified season. Picocyanobacteria were more sensitive to high solar and UV radiation compared with picoeukaryotes, which were not affected by high solar radiation and nutrient enrichment stimulated their growth. The opposing response of these two populations is consistent with their vertical distribution: picocyanobacteria dominate below the 30% isolume and above the nitrocline depth, whereas picoeukaryotes increase in the vicinity of the nitrocline and thus increased nutrient concentration. This spatial separation of picophytoplankton groups along environmental gradients in Lake Tahoe is consistent with other deep-oligotrophic lakes and the marine environment, suggesting that these marine and freshwater organisms have similar ecophysiological requirements. These results highlight that the smallest photosynthetic communities show taxon-specific responses to mixing and resource availability, which affect the structure and dynamics of picophytoplankton.

AB We investigated the effects of 4% seawater (sw), 8% sw, 12% sw and 16% sw (1.4 g NaCl L-1, 2.8 g NaCl L-1, 4.2 g NaCl L-1 and 5.6 g NaCl L-1, respectively) on survival, mass and development of larvae of the brown tree frog, Litoria ewingii. Salinity of 16% sw significantly decreased survival of tadpoles such that 39% of tadpoles in 16% sw treatment survived to metamorphosis compared with 92% in the control group (freshwater). Growth (mass) of 16% sw tadpoles (0.048 g +/- 0.005 g) slowed significantly during early development compared with control tadpoles (0.105 g +/- 0.004 g); however, there was no significant difference in final metamorphosis mass between 16% sw (0.192 g +/- 0.008 g) and control tadpoles (0.226 +/- 0.006 g). Time taken to reach metamorphosis was greater for 16% sw tadpoles (84 +/- 1.8 days) than for control tadpoles (55 +/- 0.84 days). Tadpoles at salinity concentrations of 4% sw, 8% sw and 12% sw were significantly heavier than control tadpoles at metamorphosis. Our results show that moderate levels of salinity (16% sw) are sufficient to significantly reduce survival and retard development of tadpoles of L. ewingii.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Transitional water ecosystems have low water exchanges and can trap chemicals and microplastics (MPs). In this study, MPs, trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-PHAs levels and the oxidative stress response were assessed in Mytilus galloprovincialis from two Italian lagoon ecosystems (Orbetello and Varano). In addition, the ecotoxicological effects induced by the exposure of M. galloprovincialis to high-density polyethylene-HDPE MPs were also determined. Levels of trace elements were almost always comparable among the sites, whereas MPs were found only in mussels from Orbetello. PAHs were always under the limit of quantification. Glutathione peroxidase and malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in mussels from Varano. As regard the exposure test, it was found a significant effect of treatment, site and their interaction on mortality and biochemical bio-markers in both fed and unfed mussels. However, principal component analysis suggests similar effects of both color and nourishment condition on biochemical biomarkers. These findings warrant further investigation.

AB Contaminants bound to suspended solids transported by stormwater pose quantity and quality problems to the water ecosystem. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an ecological risk assessment. Currently, Polish legal regulations do not require that stormwater sediments should be tested for hazardous substances prior to their removal. Ecological evaluation was performed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals in the sediments from three selected stormwater sedimentation tanks located in urban catchment areas of Kielce city. The purpose this study was to analyze sediments for chemical contaminants and to demonstrate the relationship between contaminant levels and physical attributes of the catchment, including land use, drainage area, age of catchment and impervious surface in the watershed. Levels of PAHs and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn) in stormwater sediments were then compared with Polish regulations and ecological screening values to determine their potential risk to environment were established. The results of the current study suggest that stormwater sediments are moderately contaminated with PAHs and heavy metals according to domestic regulations. They are, however, highly contaminated according to ecological benchmarks, which are exceeded several times.

TI Comparison of the biogeochemistry of lakes and estuaries: ecosystem
   processes, functional groups, hysteresis effects and interactions
   between macro- and microbiology
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB This paper reviews the biogeochemistry of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and their associated minor elements (iron and sulfur) in rivers, lakes and estuaries. The biogeochemistry of these elements can be explained by the physiology and stoichiometry of the major functional groups of micro- and macrobiota in these ecosystems. Furthermore, the global patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in freshwater and marine systems are explicable in terms of evolutionary differences between the major functional groups in freshwater and marine ecosystems, and their physiology and stoichiometry, as well as the interactions of carbon, iron, water residence times and ionic strength as the water flows from catchments to the sea. The highly non-linear responses of aquatic ecosystems to changing catchment loads of major and minor elements are explained by the interactions of the major functional groups and by competition between the pelagic and the benthos for nutrients and light.

TI The Role of Biotic and Abiotic Component of the Aquatic Ecosystems in
   the Formation of Ecological Trouble in Tsimlyansky and Manychsky
   Reservoirs
SO WATER RESOURCES
AB The relative importance of indicators of biotic and abiotic components of water ecosystems of the Tsimlyansky and the Manychsky (Proletarian and Veselovsky) reservoirs in the process of formation of states of ecological trouble: "ecological stress," "extraordinary ecological situation" and "ecological disaster," provided by a number of existing normative and methodical documents is investigated. For this purpose, the shares of indicators as a percentage of their total number in the dynamics of negative changes in aquatic ecosystems were compared on the basis of long-term monitoring information of Roshydromet and data of own expeditionary investigation in reservoirs on hydrobiological, toxicological and physico-chemical indicators. The role of the biotic component increases as the state of the aquatic ecosystem deteriorates of the Tsimlyansky reservoir, on the contrary, decreases in the Manychsky it is established. The role of the abiotic component is great and similar in all reservoirs; it increases already in a state extraordinary ecological situation but in ecological disaster is somewhat reduced. It is concluded that the proposed new approach to the analysis of the role of biotic and abiotic components in the development of negative changes in the ecosystem opens up new opportunities in the study of the formation of water quality and the state of water bodies.

TI Impact of the Development of Hydrocarbon Deposits on Water Ecosystems of
   the Yamal Peninsula
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Data of monitoring studies (2014-2016) on the state of hydrobionts in watercourses during the development of a hydrocarbon deposit on the Yamal Peninsula have been analyzed. The increased content of suspended solids has the greatest effect on hydrobionts. While the background values of concentration of suspended solids is 4-6 mg/L, in the area of the entrance of the pit effluents to the watercourses, their concentration increases up to 440 mg/L and higher. The effect of increased turbidity on the qualitative and quantitative indicators of planktonic organisms has not been found. An increase of suspended solids in water has a negative effect on zoobenthos (r(Sp) = -0.426, p = 0.030 for the number of species; r(Sp) = -0.590, p = 0.002 for the abundance; r(Sp) = -0.480, p = 0.013 for the biomass) and fish (r(Sp) = -0.567, p = 0.004 for ecological density of small fish species). Especially sensitive fish to the increased content of suspended solids are whitefishes and lake minnows. The most tolerant to turbidity are the nine-spined stickleback and Barbatula toni. Increased concentrations of suspended solids in autumn are the reason for the cessation of up-stream migration of whitefishes from the Gulf of Ob to the deep lakes.

TI The microbiome mediates the interaction between predation and heavy
   metals
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Gut microbiota communities are fundamental ecological components in the aquatic food web. Their potential to mediate how organisms respond to multiple environmental stressors remains understudied. Here we explored how manipulations of the gut microbiome of Daphnia pulex, a keystone species in aquatic communities, influenced life history (size at maturity, age at maturity, somatic growth rate and clutch size), morphology (induced defence) and body condition (lipid status deposits) responses to combined anthropogenic (copper) and natural (predation risk) stress. Data from a factorial experiment revealed that the effect of predation risk on traits was often mediated by copper (predation risk and copper interact). These patterns align with theory linking predation risk and copper contamination via digestive physiology. We also found that each stressor, and their combination, was associated with the same community composition of the D. pulex microbiome. However, antibiotic manipulation of the microbiome reversed 7/12 the trait responses across life history, morphology and body condition. This was associated with dramatically different communities to control conditions, with clear and unique patterns of microbiome community composition for each stressor and their combination. Our study revealed that microbiome community composition is highly correlated with the response of organisms to multiple, simultaneous stressors.

   CONDITIONS OF ENVIRONMENTALLY POLLUTED AREA MIDDLE SPIS (SLOVAKIA)
SO CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Long-term mining and subsequent processing activities predominantly focused on copper and mercury became the main source of soil pollution in the Middle Spis area. The natural environment of former mining areas is significantly disrupted by toxic elements, which enter the soil and water ecosystem. Total content of toxic elements (Cu, As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Hg), biological (activity of urease (TYRE), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and catalase (CAT) and chemical (soil reaction (pH), organic carbon (C-ox), available content of nutrients (P, K, Mg) soil properties were determined. The research was carried out at the heaps and grasslands in the cadastres of three villages (Krompachy, Rudnany, Slovinky). Extremely high and about the limit value of Cu, As and Hg were determined at all sampling sites. Activity of soil enzymes observed in our study proved, their ability to reflect soil degradation caused by heavy metal pollution. Activity of URE, ACP, ALP decreased with increasing of heavy metal content in soils. Significantly acidic environment on the heaps of waste material was found, compared to the grasslands. Heaps showed lower values of organic carbon and nutrients, but no direct influence of soil pollution to the organic carbon, soil pH and nutrients was found.

TI A new fluorescent oligonucleotide probe for in situ detection of
   s-triazine-degrading Rhodococcus wratislaviensis in contaminated
   groundwater and soil samples
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB A bacterial strain (FPA1) capable of using terbuthylazine, simazine, atrazine, 2-hydroxysimazine, deethylatrazine, isopropylamine or ethylamine as its sole carbon source was isolated from a shallow aquifer chronically contaminated with s-triazine herbicides. Based on its 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the strain FPA1 was identified as Rhodococcus wratislaviensis. The disappearance time of 50% of the initial terbuthylazine concentration in the presence of this strain (DT50) was 62 days. This strain was also able to mineralise the [U-ring C-14] triazine-ring, albeit at a slow rate. A 16S rRNA target oligonucleotide probe (RhLu) was designed, and the FISH protocol was optimised, in order to detect R. wratisloviensis in striazine-contaminated sites. The RhLu probe gave a positive signal (expressed as % of total DAPI-positive cells) in both the groundwater (2.19 +/- 0.41%) and soil (2.10 +/- 0.96%) samples analysed. Using the RhLu probe, R. wratislaviensis can be readily detected, and its population dynamics can be easily monitored, in soil and in water ecosystems contaminated with s-triazine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the isolation, from groundwater, of a bacterial strain able to degrade s-triazines. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ASSESSMENT OF WATER RELATED ECOLOGICAL SECURITY UNDER CHANGING
   ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Over the last few decades intensive human activities and climate changing have stressed ecological systems impeding sustainable development of the social economy in many regions in China. The importance of ecological security has gained greater prominence. Sustaining or restoring natural functions of water ecosystems is also crucial for human welfare. To assess water related ecological security (WES), this paper constructed a framework based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model with indicators in terms of society, economy, water resources, water environment and ecology. The Entropy Method was used to determine the weighting of each indicator. Spatial distribution and temporal trend of WES was then analyzed in China. With weighting analyses, dominant factors threatening eco-security were identified. Results show that the basin of Inland Rivers in the Northwest (IRNW) and the basin of Rivers in the Southwest (RSW) are the most ecologically threatened regions in China. In the IRNW basin, the WES is mostly affected by the factors of water consumption ratio and soil erosion area ratio, while in the RSW basin it was influenced by the natural population increase ratio and the investment percent of GDP in environmental pollution treatment. Most WES indexes (WESIs) in the ten basins show an increasing trend, except for that in the basin of Rivers in Southeast (RSE) which has a decreasing trend due to the reduced investment ratio of environmental pollution treatment. These results will provide valuable information to water resources management.

CY APR 22-23, 1994
CL WATERLOO, CANADA

AB Most landscapes contain wetland ecosystems that form transitions (ecotones) between upland and open water ecosystems. In the U.S., the Clean Water Act regulates wetlands in order to maintain wetland functions (e.g., flood protection and water quality improvement). Theoretically, wetland areas that carry out these functions are delineated for regulatory jurisdiction. Ideally, the boundary would be drawn at the point where critical functions diminish rapidly as one moves from the wetter to the drier parts of the ecosystem. Because scientific data on functional capacity are difficult to obtain, structural attributes which can be examined over shorter periods of time often are used as surrogate measures. Species composition, soil type, and hydrologic indicators all have proven to be useful indicators of wetland functioning. Thus, in delineating wetlands for any purpose, it must be remembered that wetland functions are a product of all components of the wetland ecosystem (not just vascular plants), that the wetland functions year round (not just when vascular plants are actively growing), and that critical functions (such as flood protection) will occur only at irregular intervals.
   In a landscape context, wetlands and wetland ecotones are important transition zones between uplands and aquatic ecosystems. They are sites where nutrient concentrations change as water flows between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and are thus important buffers between uplands and open waters. Research questions are suggested in two categories: (1) issues related to planning for maintenance of wetland functions, and (2) issues specifically related to effective wetland management.

TI Metabolomic Analysis of Microcystis aeruginosa After Exposure to the
   Algicide L-Lysine
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB The widespread occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms damages the water ecosystem and threatens the safety of potable water and human health. Exogenous L-lysine significantly inhibits the growth of a dominant cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa in freshwater. However, the molecular mechanism of how lysine inhibits the growth of M. aeruginosa is unclear. In this study, both non-target and target metabolomic analysis were performed to investigate the effects of algicide L-lysine. The results showed that 8 mg L- 1 lysine most likely disrupts the metabolism of amino acids, especially the arginine and proline metabolism. According to targeted amino acid metabolomics analysis, only 3 amino acids (L-arginine, ornithine, and citrulline), which belong to the ornithine-ammonia cycle (OAC) in arginine metabolic pathway, showed elevated levels. The intracellular concentrations of ornithine, citrulline, and arginine increased by 115%, 124%, and 19.4%, respectively. These results indicate that L-lysine may affect arginine metabolism and OAC to inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa.

TI Food selection of Coregonus lavaretus in a brackish water ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
AB This study examined how variability in the abundance and biomass structure of benthic invertebrates affected the feeding choice of the whitefish Coregonus lavaretus on a hard bottom habitat of the brackish Baltic Sea. In general, crustaceans such as Idotea balthica and Gammarus spp. were preferred over molluscs. Although being the most numerous taxon in the invertebrate samples, Mytilus trossulus was the lowest ranking in C. lavaretus food preference. The availability of benthic invertebrate prey set the dietary range of fish but the selectivity largely described fish feeding within this range. There was no clear link between fish predation and the dominance structure of benthic invertebrate communities, suggesting that species composition, abundance and biomass of invertebrate species had no impact on the feeding selectivity of the fish. Thus, while fish predation may not affect the dominant species within a benthic community, due to strong selectivity fish may impose strong pressure on some rarer but highly preferred invertebrate prey species.

TI Effects of nutrient enrichment on boreal streams: invertebrates, fungi
   and leaf-litter breakdown
SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB 1. The effect of nutrient enrichment on structural (invertebrate indices) and functional (leaf-litter breakdown rates) characteristics of stream integrity was studied in nine boreal streams.
   2. The results showed predicted changes in biotic indices and leaf-litter breakdown along a complex (principal component) nutrient gradient. Biotic indices were better correlated with nutrient effects than leaf-litter breakdown.
   3. Fungal biomass and invertebrate densities in the litter bags were positively correlated with leaf-litter breakdown, and both were also positively related to the nutrient gradient.
   4. Invertebrate community composition influenced breakdown rate. High breakdown rates at one site were associated with the high abundance of the detritivore Asellus aquaticus.
   5. This study lends support to the importance of invertebrate and fungi as mediators of leaf-litter decomposition. However, our study also shows that study design (length of incubation) can confound the interpretation of nutrient-induced effects on decomposition.

TI Cost-effective reduction of micro pollutants in the water cycle - Case
   study on iodinated contrast media
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Surface waters, especially in densely populated areas, are facing multiple anthropogenic pressures. Micro pollutants are of growing concern. Improved analytical methods are used to focus on substances like ICM with a (high) potential of hazardous effects against water organisms or the water quality in general ICM are essential for instance in computer tomographic examinations in medical facilities. Discharge of ICM to the sewer system occurs via human urine excretions. Common waste water treatment plants do not eliminate these substances completely. Therefore, increasing concentrations are found in the rivers worldwide. The project MERK'MAL explored a potentially cost-effective measure to reduce ICM in the River Ruhr, located in Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia. The results from this pilot study show that urine bags are an effective measure to reduce ICM concentrations. During the urine collection with bags measurements of ICM concentrations have shown a reduction, compared to the baseline concentration that was measured at the same sampling point in the effluent of the corresponding waste water treatment plant. The ICM reduction ranged between 20 and 34% for the mean values and between 7 and 33% for the median value. Additional payment equivalent costs per examination with ICM are approx. 3.36 (sic), full costs including imputed costs are expected in a cost range of 5.38 (sic) to 6.09 (sic) per examination. The extension of the study is envisioned, helping to sustainably enhance water quality in the River Ruhr in terms of ICM concentrations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterization of bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater
   according to probable modes of hexadecane uptake
SO MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater were characterized according toprobable modes of hexadecane uptake based on data for cell surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying activity, glycoside content and surface tension of cell-free culture medium. The results obtained suggested that both modes of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake by bacterial strains take place, direct uptake and alkane transfer. The increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and glycoside production by the strains suggested the existence of biosurfactant-enhanced interfacial uptake of the alkane. Such mechanism is probably predominant for three isolates, Staphylococcus sp. HW-2, Streptococcus sp. HW-9 and Bacillus sp. HW-4. Secreted biosurfactants enhanced mainly alkane emulsification for most hydrophobic isolate Arthrobacter sp. HW-8, and micellar transfer for most hydrophilic isolate Streptococcus sp. HW-5. For other strains (67%) both mechanisms of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake probably take place in similar degree, interfacial uptake and alkane emulsification. The results obtained could contribute to clarifying the natural relationships between the members of water ecosystem studied as welt as will reveal potential producers of surface active compounds.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Management and conservation of freshwater habitat requires fine spatial resolution and watershed-scale and life-stage-specific methods due to complex linkages among land, climate, water uses, and aquatic organism necessities. In this study, we present a valley-scale microhabitat resolution, process-based bioenergetics approach that combines high-resolution topobathymetric LiDAR survey with two-dimensional hydrodynamic and bioenergetics modeling. We applied the model to investigate the role of lateral habitat, stream morphological complexity, water use, and temperature regimes on aquatic habitat quality distribution of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within the Lemhi River (eastern Idaho, USA). Modeling results showed two key aspects: (i) a reduction in diverted flows is not sufficient to improve habitat quality potentially because of a legacy of morphological simplification (directly due to straightening and wood removal and indirectly due to low in-channel flows) and (ii) morphological complexity and connectivity with side channels and margin areas, which are key and vital elements to support suitable habitats that meet or exceed energetic needs to sustain or promote growth of individuals and populations.

TI Highly sensitive B, N co-doped carbon dots for fluorescent and
   colorimetric dual-mode detection of mercury ions in wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Mercury ions (Hg2+) owing to excessive discharge cause serious damage to human health and the water ecosystem via bioaccumulation in food chains. Novel materials employed for the high-performance monitoring of Hg2+ are urgently required. Herein, using sucrose, boric acid, and melamine as raw materials, a new nano-material sensor, namely boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon dots (B, N-CDs), was designed for fluorescent and colorimetric dual-mode detection of Hg2+. Because of the occurrence of both dynamic and static quenching, B, N- CDs were utilized to function as fluorescent sensors for detecting Hg2+ with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.3 nM. B, N-CDs performed an action for catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue cationic radical via peroxidase mimetic activity. By sequentially adding cysteine and Hg2+ to control the emergence of the TMB cation radical, a sensor for the Hg2+ assay was established through the colorimetric "on-off-on" signal and the LOD was as low as 7.8 nM. Moreover, the application potential of B, N-CDs for complex water environments was demonstrated to be excellent. In summary, the dual-mode detection method delivers some valid strategies for the detection of mercury in aqueous solutions employing the functional nanomaterials mentioned, and opens new avenues in tackling the problem of heavy metal ion pollution for environmental monitoring and remediation.

TI Water Quality Evaluation of the Yangtze River in China Using Machine
   Learning Techniques and Data Monitoring on Different Time Scales
SO WATER
AB Unlike developed countries, China has a nationally unified water environment standard and a specific watershed protection bureau to perform water quality evaluation. It is a major challenge to assess the water quality of a large watershed at a wide spatial scale and to make decisions in a scientific way. In 2016, weekly and real-time data for four monitoring indicators (pH, dissolved oxygen, permanganate index, and ammonia nitrogen) were collected at 21 surface water sections (sites) of the Yangtze River Basin, China. Results showed that one site had a relatively low Site Water Quality Index and was polluted for 12 weeks meanwhile. By using expectation-maximization clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithms, the 21 sites were classified. Variable spatiotemporal distribution characteristics for water quality and pollutants were found; some sites exhibited similar water quality variations on the weekly scale, but had different yearly grades. The results revealed polluted water quality for short periods and abrupt anomalies, which imply potential pollution sources and negative effects on water ecosystems. Potential spatio-temporal water quality characteristics, explored by machine learning methods and evidenced by time series and statistical models, could be applied in environmental decision support systems to make watershed management more objective, reliable, and powerful.

TI High-Temperature-Tolerant Fungus and Oomycetes in Korea, Including
   Saksenaea longicolla sp. nov.
SO MYCOBIOLOGY
AB Global temperatures are steadily increasing, leading to significant changes in microbial diversity and ecology. In the present study, we isolated high-temperature-growing fungi and fungi-like group (Oomycota) strains from freshwater environments of Korea and identified them based on cultural, morphological, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses. As a result, we introduce Saksenaea (Fungi) isolates as a new species, Saksenaea longicolla sp. nov. and record Phytophthora chlamydospora and P. lagoariana (Oomycota) new to Korea. In the growth experiments, they exhibited high-temperature tolerance, which can grow at 35-40 degrees C but become inactive at 4 degrees C and below. This study confirms the presence of high-temperature-tolerant fungi and oomycetes in Korea and suggests that the Korean climate conditions are changing in favor of these species. This indicates that climate warming is altering microbial distributions in freshwater environments.

TI Stressor-response relationships and the prospective management of
   aquatic ecosystems
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Scientists and environmental managers use stressor-response (S-R) relationships to characterise and predict ecological and socioeconomic responses to anthropogenic stressors in lakes and other aquatic ecosystems. S-R relationships with thresholds (stressor levels beyond which small increases cause large responses) are reported with increasing frequency. Threshold responses pose risks of unanticipated degradation, but also provide a stimulus for shifting environmental management strategies from retrospective (focused on post-hoc responses to degradation) to prospective (focused on preventing degradation). We set out a framework for interpreting S-R relationships in terms of functional forms, trajectories, thresholds and slopes. These characteristics convey information about resistance to degradation and recovery, risks of threshold exceedance, and alternate stable states. We then set out steps for implementing threshold-based management strategies, which are based on forecasting S-R relationships and carrying out preventative actions within an adaptive framework. Prospective, threshold-based management is a challenging yet promising alternative to the prevailing retrospective strategies.

TI Climate change and drinking water quality: Predicting high
   trihalomethane occurrence in water utilities supplied by surface water
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB This study estimates the impact of future variations in temperature and precipitation - associated with climate change scenarios - on the probability of total Trihalomethanes (TTHM) concentrations exceeding a threshold in drinking water. 108 drinking water utilities (DWUs) located in the Province of Quebec (Canada) were selected for this study. Temperature and precipitation variations from the period 2006-2009 to three predicted periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099) were estimated using two climate models and three emission scenarios. The probability of TTHM threshold exceedances was calculated using a multilevel logistic regression model based on three variables (treatment type, temperature, and precipitation) and three hierarchical levels (TTHM samples, DWUs and source water ecosystem). Results showed a low but significant increase in the probability of TTHM threshold exceedances over time (between 1.9% and 4.7%). There was also a significant probability difference between seasons (up to 30%) and between treatment types (between 25% and 40%).

TI Strong and recurring seasonality revealed within stream diatom
   assemblages
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Improving stream water quality in agricultural landscapes is an ecological priority and a legislative duty for many governments. Ecosystem health can be effectively characterised by organisms sensitive to water quality changes such as diatoms, single-celled algae that are a ubiquitous component of stream benthos. Diatoms respond within daily timescales to variables including light, temperature, nutrient availability and flow conditions that result from weather and land use characteristics. However, little consideration has been given to the ecological dynamics of diatoms through repeated seasonal cycles when assessing trajectories of stream function, even in catchments actively managed to reduce human pressures. Here, six years of monthly diatom samples from three independent streams, each receiving differing levels of diffuse agricultural pollution, reveal robust and repeated seasonal variation. Predicted seasonal changes in climate-related variables and anticipated ecological impacts must be fully captured in future ecological and water quality assessments, if the apparent resistance of stream ecosystems to pollution mitigation measures is to be better understood.

TI Analysis of the complete genome sequence of the archaeon Pyrococcus
   chitonophagus DSM 10152 (formerly Thermococcus chitonophagus)
SO EXTREMOPHILES
AB Here we analyze the first complete genome sequence of Pyrococcus chitonophagus. The archaeon was previously suggested to belong to the Thermococcus rather than the Pyrococcus genus. Whole genome phylogeny as well as whole proteome comparisons using all available complete genomes in Thermococcales clearly showed that the species belongs to the Pyrococcus genus. P. chitonophagus was originally isolated from a hydrothermal vent site and it has been described to effectively degrade chitin debris, and therefore is considered to play a major role in the sea water ecology and metabolic activity of microbial consortia within hot sea water ecosystems. Indeed, an obvious feature of the P. chitonophagus genome is that it carries proteins showing complementary activities for chitin degradation, i.e. endo- and exo-chitinase, diacetylchitobiose deacetylase and exo-beta-d glucosaminidase activities. This finding supports the hypothesis that compared to other Thermococcales species P. chitonophagus is adapted to chitin degradation.

TI Ecological Wisdom and Inheritance Thinking of the Traditional Village's
   Water Resources Management in Taihang Mountains
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB In the context of China's rapid urbanization, the landscape texture and ecosystem of traditional villages are being constructively damaged, especially the water ecosystem responsible for maintaining the sustainable development of villages. It is urgent to explore the green construction technology of traditional villages. However, some traditional villages in Taihang Mountain area exist and develop in the environment of drought and flood, which contains rich ecological water resources management wisdom. Therefore, in this paper, Taihang Mountain is selected as the research area to collect data through literature analysis, field research, and in-depth interviews. This study uses ArcGIS spatial analysis and statistical functions to analyze the acquired data and explore the water resources management practices of traditional villages based on three aspects: safety, function, and spirit. Then it summarizes four key inspirations for contemporary water resources management: "adapt to local conditions, pay equal attention to water use and prevention"; "division of labor and cooperation complement each other", "low cost, low technology, low maintenance" and "make the best use of materials and compound functions". These advantageous insights can be offered for the preservation of traditional villages, the enhancement of the living environment, and the management and growth of urban stormwater.

TI Threats to the running water ecosystems of the world
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB Running waters are perhaps the most impacted ecosystem on the planet as they have been the focus for human settlement and are heavily exploited for water supplies, irrigation, electricity generation, and waste disposal. Lotic systems also have an intimate contact with their catchments and so land-use alterations affect them directly. Here long-term trends in the factors that currently impact running waters are reviewed with the aim of predicting what the main threats to rivers will be in the year 2025. The main ultimate factors forcing change in running waters (ecosystem destruction, physical habitat and water chemistry alteration, and the direct addition or removal of species) stem from proximate influences from urbanization, industry, land-use change and water-course alterations. Any one river is likely to be subjected to several types of impact, and the management of impacts on lotic systems is complicated by numerous links between different forms of anthropogenic effect. Long-term trends for different impacts vary. Concentrations of chemical pollutants such as toxins and nutrients have increased in rivers in developed countries over the past century, with recent reductions for some pollutants (e.g. metals, organic toxicants, acidification), and continued increases in others (e.g. nutrients); there are no long-term chemical data for developing countries. Dam construction increased rapidly during the twentieth century, peaking in the 1970s, and the number of reservoirs has stabilized since this time, whereas the transfer of exotic species between lotic systems continues to increase. Hence, there have been some success stories in the attempts to reduce the impacts from anthropogenic impacts in developed nations. Improvements in the pH status of running waters should continue with lower sulphurous emissions, although emissions of nitrous oxides are set to continue under current legislation and will continue to contribute to acidification and nutrient loadings. Climate change also will impact running waters through alterations in hydrology and thermal regimes, although precise predictions are problematic; effects are likely to vary between regions and to operate alongside rather than override those from other impacts. Effects from climate change may be more extreme over longer time scales (>50 years). The overriding pressure on running water ecosystems up to 2025 will stem from the predicted increase in the human population, with concomitant increases in urban development, industry, agricultural activities and water abstraction, diversion and damming. Future degradation could be substantial and rapid (c. 10 years) and will be concentrated in those areas of the world where resources for conservation are most limited and knowledge of lotic ecosystems most incomplete; damage will centre on lowland rivers, which are also relatively poorly studied. Changes in management practices and public awareness do appear to be benefiting running water ecosystems in developed countries, and could underpin conservation strategies in developing countries if they were implemented in a relevant way.

   Diversified Forest Ponds of Eastern Poland
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB One of the most interesting and relatively little known water ecosystems of "Lasy Janowskie" Landscape Park is a group of old ponds which have been excluded from intensive fisheries for many decades. Two of these ponds, belonging to pond complexes, and two other situated outside such complexes were studied in 1996, 2005, 2013 and 2015, regarding their planktonic rotifer assemblages. The total of 65 rotifer taxa were recorded in the plankton. The number of its species in individual reservoirs and years of study ranged from 7 to 21, and their density was from 29 to 775 ind. dm(-3). As many as 25 species in individual ponds and study periods represented dominnats. The present work aimed at determining which of those tiny yet floristically rich ponds were inhabited by more sustainable rotifer assemblages, regarding both their quality and quantity, and to which ecological qualities was such sustainability related to a higher degree; species richness, their diversity, density, biomass, composition or domination structure.. The results of the studies revealed slight variability of ecological properties among the planktonic rorifers in the ponds composing large reservoir groups and a significantly higher variability of these qualities in the "single" ponds which were situated at a long distance from large pond complexes.

SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB In response to worldwide environmental crises driven by declines in the availability or quality of freshwater, ecologists and water resource economists are searching for ways to collaborate in order to guide the difficult choices facing the public, land managers, and politicians. Scientists are challenged to detect and quantify both the drivers of ecosystem change and ecosystem responses, including positive and negative feedbacks that will determine the future states of inland waters. Predicting ecosystem shifts over large temporal and spatial scales has proven difficult or impossible, even in well-studied systems, where the drivers of change are known. New remote-sensing, monitoring, and tracer technologies, however, offer glimpses of watershed processes at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Several interdisciplinary groups, including scientists, information specialists, and engineers, are exploring the best ways to design sampling schemes using these new technologies, to interpret the extensive, spatially explicit dynamic data they will yield, and to use these data to formulate models useful for forecasting. Economists, in turn, can use this information to design management and policy tools for sustaining critical ecosystem components and processes.

TI The role of knowledge in residential lawn management
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Researchers have long argued that environmental knowledge is a necessary component for improving individual environmental behavior. We take up this discussion in the context of homeowner lawn management. Using survey data from a 2011 yard care study conducted in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metro area, we explore the level of knowledge homeowners possess in regards to their lawn, and how this knowledge relates to best management practices as well as the awareness of linkages between the lawn and the local ecosystem. We conceptualize knowledge at an instrumental/technical level and showed that many homeowners were lacking in specific instrumental knowledge of their lawn management. However, individuals with more knowledge of their lawn management were more likely to manage their lawns in a manner consistent with recommended best practices and also were more aware of the local water ecosystem. Essentially, many homeowners had limited knowledge, suggesting that increasing knowledge may help improve best lawn practices, but it alone will not transform homeowners into the highly effective lawn managers.

TI Global versus local change effects on a large European river
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Water temperature and discharge are fundamental to lotic ecosystem function, and both are strongly affected by climate. In large river catchments, however, climatic effects might be difficult to discern from background variability and other cumulative sources of anthropogenic change arising from local land and water management. Here, we use trend analysis and generalised linear modelling on the Loire, the longest river in France to test the hypotheses that i) long-term trends in discharge and river temperature have arisen from climate change and ii) climatic effects on water quality have not been overridden by local effects.
   Over 32 years (1977-2008), discharge in the Middle Loire fell by about 100 m(3)/s while water temperature increased by 1.2 degrees C with greatest effects during the warm period (May-August). Although increasing air temperature explained 80% of variations in water temperature, basin-wide precipitation showed no long-term trend and accounted for only 18% of inter-annual fluctuations in flow. We suggest that trends in abstraction coupled with a potential increase in evapo-transpiration at the catchment scale could be responsible for the majority of the long-term discharge trend.
   Discharge and water temperature explained only 20% of long-term variations in major water quality variables (conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, suspended matter, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate, phosphate and chlorophyll-a), with phosphate and chlorophyll declining contrary to expectations from global change probably as a consequence of improved wastewater treatment.
   These data partially support our first hypothesis in revealing how warming in the Loire has been consistent with recent atmospheric warming. However, local management has had larger effects on discharge and water quality in ways that could respectively exacerbate (abstraction) or ameliorate (reduced point-source pollution) warming effects. As one of the first case-studies of its kind, this multi-parametric study illustrates the potential for complex interactions between climate change and other environmental factors in large rivers.

TI Climate Change Effects on Hydrology and Ecology of Wetlands in the
   Mid-Atlantic Highlands
SO WETLANDS
AB Global climate change has received increased attention in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands (MAH) Region of the United States in recent years. Several climate models predict increases in mean temperature of 1-5A degrees C over the next one hundred years for the region, which has considerable implications for wetland ecosystems already encumbered by numerous anthropogenic stressors; however, historical (i.e., 1890s-current) data from the MAH presented here show increasing trends in precipitation intensity and decreasing trends in temperature. Continuation of historical trends for the next 90 years are used to predict potential impacts on regional wetland extent and function using empirical and conceptual models. Recommendations for management of climate related impacts on wetlands include analysis of historical climate trends at regional and local scales, establishment of wetland monitoring networks to quantify impacts of climate induced stress on wetland ecosystems, and integration of historical trends and research findings into empirical and conceptual models. Management strategies of this nature will facilitate early detection and mitigation of climate induced effects on wetlands in the MAH.

TI The role of mobile consumers in lake nutrient cycles: a brief review
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB We summarise current understanding of consumer recycling in lake nutrient cycles and expand on it by integrating emerging knowledge from food web ecology. The role of consumer nutrient recycling (CNR) is initially framed in the wider context of lake nutrient cycling, which includes hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes, and their responses to global environmental change. Case studies are used to demonstrate that effects of CNR on lake ecosystems range widely, from reduced nutrient cycling rates to exacerbation of eutrophication. CNR depends on consumer biomass, body size and diet, remaining relatively consistent through the year and becoming important as other fluxes seasonally ebb. Universal patterns in food web structure, for example, consumer-resource biomass ratios, body size scaling and relationships between trophic level and diet breadth, are used to demonstrate the predictability of CNR effects. Larger, mobile, top predators excrete nutrients at a lower rate but over a wider range, linking nutrient cycles across habitats. Smaller-bodied, lower trophic level consumers have strong localised nutrient cycling effects associated with their limited mobility. Global environmental-change drivers that alter food web structure are likely to have the greatest impact on CNR rates and should direct future studies.

TI IDENTIFICATION OF THE BLOOM FORMING ULVA AND MACROALGAL ASSEMBLAGE IN
   JAMAICA BAY, NEW YORK, USA
SO RHODORA
AB Eutrophication is prevalent in shallow water ecosystems worldwide. Ulva is a genus of bloom forming macroalgae that occur in shallow estuaries. Ulva have ecosystem consequences such as Zostera spp. degradation, fish and shellfish declines. The presented study describes a comprehensive survey of Ulva spp. distributed in Jamaica Bay, NY, USA. Using ITS and tufA DNA Barcoding and cytological techniques, we identified the dominant species of Ulva at 8 sites in Jamaica Bay and 1 site in Long Island Sound, CT to match Ulva compressa, U. cf. clathratioides, U. prolifera, U. stipitata, U. laetevirens, and U. lactuca with other sequences world-wide. All samples collected had <1% divergence between species. Ulva stipitata, a compressed tubular species, was found in Jamaica Bay and is the second known occurrence of the species in the Northwest Atlantic. The presented study has management implications because we know the nitrogen storage potential of Ulva spp. from this major bay in metropolitan New York City coastal waters. Modelling the storage of nitrogen in Ulva spp. could be useful for optimal harvesting purposes to manage Ulva blooms.

TI Fine-scale environmental gradients formed by local pollutants largely
   impact zooplankton communities in running water ecosystems
SO AQUATIC BIOLOGY
AB Many freshwater ecosystems suffer from multiple environmental stressors derived from anthropogenic activities. It is therefore necessary to investigate how environmental changes influence composition and functioning of biological communities such as zooplankton. At fine geographical scales, a well-known view on meta-community dynamics suggests that high dispersal can strongly homogenize community structure along water flows, largely erasing signals left by species sorting. However, a recent study by Xiong et al. (2017; Mol Ecol 26:4351-4360) challenges this view, showing that species sorting derived from an environmental gradient overrode the process of dispersal to determine the zooplankton community structure in running river ecosystems at fine geographical scales (the fine-scale species sorting hypothesis). Here we chose zooplankton communities from Fuyang River in north China to test the newly proposed hypothesis and identified the environmental factors contributing to meta-community dynamics in running water ecosystems. Multiple analyses based on high-throughput sequencing showed significantly varied zooplankton community composition and geographical distribution determined by an environmental gradient. Our study clearly shows that local chemical pollution, such as metal pollutants Cu and Mg, largely contributes to the observed patterns. Our study successfully identified local pollutants that influenced meta-community dynamics. Thus, we support the fine-scale species sorting hypothesis, indicating that a strong environmental gradient at fine geographical scales can strengthen the process of species sorting. As many rivers suffer from anthropogenic environmental stressors, an urgent need exists to integrate both environmental and community information when investigating how environmental changes influence community composition and functioning.

TI Characteristics of marine aggregates in shallow-water ecosystems:
   Implications for disease ecology
SO ECOHEALTH
AB Marine aggregates were evaluated for their potential role in the ecology of aquatic pathogens using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of aggregates in modified settling cones. Six locations, two each in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, were surveyed over 8 months to explore differences in the characteristics of aggregates found in habitats populated by clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica). Microaggregate (< 500 mu m) concentrations were always greater than macroaggregate (> 500 mu m) concentrations, but peak concentrations of macroaggregates and microaggregates, mean size of particles, and volume fraction of aggregated material varied among the six shallow-water habitats. Concentrations (colony-forming units per ml) of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) and total mesophilic pathogenic bacteria (MPB) from samples of aggregates were significantly different among the four locations bordering Long Island Sound (LIS). The highest concentrations and enrichment factors in aggregates were observed in August for THB and in June for MPB. Significant correlations were detected for salinity and the concentrations and enrichment factors of THB in aggregates and for the concentrations and percentages of MPB in seawater samples. Significant correlations were also detected for temperature and the concentrations of MPB in aggregates and the enrichment factors for THB and MPB (marginal significance). Bacterial species identified in association with aggregates included: Vibrio cholerea, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacteria sp. These results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for risk-based surveillance in shallow-water ecosystems.

TI The Protozoa of Soda Lakes in East Africa
SO SODA LAKES OF EAST AFRICA
AB Protozoa, mainly ciliates, have been studied in East African soda lakes (EASL) since the 1980s. A few studies have noted the presence of flagellates, including Chlamydomonas, Ceratium and chilomonids. Amoebae have been even less studied, although Biomyxa and Platamoeba have been observed. The abundance, biomass and production of ciliates in the EASL are higher than in tropical freshwater, subtropical and temperate lakes. This is attributed to the high phytoplankton and bacterial abundance in these lakes. Accordingly, the ciliate fauna is dominated by herbivorous and bacterivorous taxa. Estimates of growth rates for ciliates in EASL range from 0.18 to 4.75 day(-1). High water temperatures allow for these fast growth rates, which together with high biomass lead to high secondary production. Some of this production can reach higher trophic organisms such as zooplankton and fish, while some is consumed by predators within the microbial food web.

TI Measuring the ecological footprint of a Himalayan tourist center
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Finding ways to assess and measure the impact of tourism and its associated development on sustainability is critical to developing long-term sustainability plans for regions such as the Indian Himalayas. Among the methods proposed is ecological footprint (EF) analysis or appropriated carrying capacity analysis. EF analysis estimates the area of productive land and water ecosystems required to produce the resources that a population consumes and to assimilate the wastes that the population produces in supporting itself. This study used EF analysis to quantify the sustainability of Manali, a rapidly growing tourist center in Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh, India, it considered the changes in the size of Manali's footprint since the advent of mass tourism in the early 1980s, the direct impact that tourists are having on the size of the footprint, and the challenges of applying this analysis in a developing world context. Data regarding land use, goods and services, and population were collected through local interviews and available data. The results indicate that between 1971 and 1995, the overall EF of Manali town grew from 2102 to 9665 ha, an increase of over 450%; the EF of Manali is now 25 times greater than its size. This indicates that Manali is increasingly relying on outside ecosystems for its sustenance. The article highlights areas of focus for future sustainability planning, including waste management, decreasing fossil fuel dependence, ecofriendly tourism, and creating greater environmental awareness, particularly among tourists.

In particular, drugs are found in urban sewage and water ecosystems. The analysis of drugs in wastewater is challenging because drugs occur at trace levels in complex organo-mineral media, calling for advanced analytical methods. Here we review recent methods developped to analyze drugs in sludge, sediments, soils and biota. Extraction methods include solid-liquid extraction, sonication, microwave, and quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe extraction (QuEChERS). We compare and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each analytical step for various sample types.

TI Microbial degradation of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in surface water and
   bacteria responsible for the process
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Due to widespread utilization in many industrial spheres and agrochemicals, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is a potential contaminant of different surface water ecosystems. Hence, investigation was made into its aerobic microbial degradability in samples of water from a river, wetland area and spring. The results showed that the compound was degradable in all water types, and that the fastest NMP removal occurred in 4 days in river water, while in the wetland and spring samples the process was relatively slow, requiring several months to complete. Key bacterial degraders were successfully isolated in all cases, and their identification proved that pseudomonads played a major role in NMP degradation in river water, while the genera Rhodococcus and Patulibacter fulfilled a similar task in the wetland sample. Regarding spring water, degrading members of the Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium genera were found.

TI Southeast Asia as the birthplace of unusual traits: the Melongenidae
   (Gastropoda) of northwest Borneo
SO CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY
AB In this paper the Miocene to recent melongenid species of northwest Borneo are discussed. The recent fauna is poor with three genera represented by one species each. In the Miocene three (possibly four) genera occur with eight (possibly nine) species of which three are described as new species: Melongena murifactor, uniquely characterized by the formation of a septum walling off the adapical sector of the aperture; Pugilina erecta, characterized (along with its close Miocene relative from Java, P. ickei) by a free-edged, erect inner lip; Volema goliath, large for the genus with later whorls progressively covering the upper row of spines of earlier whorls. The apertural septum of M. murifactor is unique within Gastropoda, whereas the erect inner lip of P. erecta and P. ickei is unique within Melongenidae. That these extralimital traits occur exclusively in the Miocene of southeast Asia is consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive innovations are most likely to arise in diverse, productive, shallow-water ecosystems.

TI Impact of road run-off on receiving streams in Eastern England
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Invertebrate samples from nine East Anglian rivers were collected above and below crossings of the A12 and A14 trunk roads in spring and summer 1996 to assess any impact due to road run-off discharges. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, average score per taxon (ASPT) and Shannon diversity index values were compared between upstream and downstream sites. Only the BMWP score was significantly lower in summer at downstream sites in those rivers crossed by the A12. Zinc, lead and cadmium concentrations in sediments and invertebrates (Asellus aquaticus, Gammarus pulex, Sialis lutaria) did not differ significantly between upstream and downstream sites. There was a significant relationship between metal concentrations in sediments and invertebrates only for lead. Road run-off from these trunk roads appears to have no major impact on the receiving streams. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Seven phycoerythrin (PE)-rich and six phycocyanin (PC)-rich unicellular cyanobacteria of the Synechococcus type were isolated from the pelagial of Lake Constance. The genetic diversity among the isolates was evaluated using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) within the psbA gene family. Nine out of 13 isolates exhibit different DNA structures in the probed areas and, furthermore, they differ from morphologically similar strains collected from other lakes. The data set does not support a principal distinction between PC-rich and PE-rich strains but it reveals less heterogeneity in the coding region of the psbA genes among PE-rich isolates than among PC-rich isolates. The isolation of distinct strains in different seasons suggests species diversity and seasonal occurrence of Synechococcus spp. in Lake Constance.

TI WHAT ROLE DOES UV-B RADIATION PLAY IN FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Increases in incident W-B radiation (280-320 nm) have been observed at temperate as well as polar latitudes in recent decades. Although UV-B radiation makes up only a small portion of the total energy of solar radiation and attenuates rapidly in the water column, the high sensitivity of living organisms to UV-B radiation makes the observed increases potentially important in aquatic ecosystems. To date, research has focused largely on the primary producers in marine ecosystems in Antarctica where ozone depletion and subsequent increases in UV-B radiation have been most pronounced. This review addresses the potential role of UV-B radiation in freshwaters by taking into account some of the information available in marine systems and applying some of the recent advances in our understanding of the ecology of freshwaters. The potential for complex rather than simple responses of freshwater ecosystems to W-B radiation is emphasized.

Here, we assess the state of the art of and present new information on the impacts of agricultural expansion, dams, and water use, and make recommendations for basin management, conservation, and restoration of water-related Cerrado ecosystems and rivers. The conservation of the Cerrado requires not only the preservation of remnants of its vegetation but also the ability to keep the hydro-geomorphological and ecological functionality of its rivers, particularly the Araguaia River, the last large well preserved and unregulated system. If business as usual continues, the Cerrado riverine ecosystems may never rebound.

TI Elemental distribution in urban sediments of small waterbodies and its
   implications: a case study from Kolkata, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB The impacts of elemental pollution in sediments of freshwater bodies are of particular concern in rapidly urbanizing cities of the developing world and have been extensively studied in rivers and lakes. The current study is an attempt to highlight the importance of smaller waterbodies, which happen to form a natural network in cities, for assessing the contamination status of sediments. The distribution of elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, S, Si, Ti, Ba, Mn, Sr, V, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in sediments of 15 ponds and 6 canals was studied to understand the overall pollution status and the associated ecological risk to aquatic organisms. Geochemical indices revealed Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn to be the principal elements of concern. The mean concentration of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn was 308, 174, 76.9 and 446 mg kg(-1), respectively. Ecological risk assessment revealed that Cr in 86% sites, Ni in 52% sites, Cu and Zn in 28% sites and Pb in 10% sites were associated with possible ecological toxicity. The findings suggest that multielemental concentration in sediments of ponds and canals could effectively distinguish between pristine and polluted sites and suitably identify the main elements of concern to support cost-efficient waste management solutions customized to both the sites and elements of concern.

TI Resource management and sustainable development: A review of the
   European water policies in accordance with the United Nations'
   Sustainable Development Goals
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Recent policy developments in Europe consider the importance of water ecosystems to human wellbeing and the detrimental effects that multiple pressures may have on them. Several directives and measures which culminated with the design and the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, have attempted to address the issue of sustainable water management while aligning with targets of economic development. We review the European Water Framework Directive keeping in mind the commitment to the United Nation' Agenda to 2030 with the aim to identify complementarities and missing parts in aligning regional policies to global targets for sustainable development. Towards this end the management plans in selected river basins, Ebro-Spain, Adige-Italy, Evrotas-Greece, SavaSlovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Anglian-UK, are examined. The analysis shows that despite significant steps towards integrated management of water bodies in Europe, it is still necessary to improve policy design and implementation to align with global sustainable development targets. Appropriate supportive methodologies must be developed that consider the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of water management. Policies should aim for environmental agreements, alternative climate change scenarios, transparent quantitative measures targeting sustainable demand of water and explicit infrastructure and knowledge transfer channels which can accelerate the implementation of sustainable water management at regional and global level.

TI Can Irrigation Technologies Save Water in Closed Basins? The effects of
   Drip Irrigation on Water Resources in the Guadalquivir River Basin
   (Spain)
SO WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND
   DEVELOPMENT
AB Numerous institutions and governments have opted to increase irrigation efficiency to tackle water problems, especially water scarcity. The purpose of this research is to analyse the effects that the introduction of new irrigation technologies has in closed basins with high water reuse and where most of the water is used for agriculture. We analyse the evolution in the water supply, the irrigated area and the crops in three irrigation communities in different sections of the Guadalquivir River Basin. The results are compared with irrigation areas where traditional irrigation systems are still in use as control groups. The new irrigation systems have triggered a wide range of responses in the irrigated areas, including increases in the size of the irrigated areas, the introduction of crops with greater water requirements, and the production of two harvests per year. Such intensification features have been enabled by the exploitation of resources that previously returned to the system. The analysis of the water balances shows that appropriate measures need to be implemented to reduce rather than increase pressure on resources, most prominently including a revision of water rights and devoting the savings to improving the quality of water ecosystems and/or to urban supply.

AB The benthos is one of the most important elements of the continental water ecosystems, which can be used as indicator of water pollution, as it reacts quickly to minor environmental changes. The distribution of benthic animals depends on substratum, quantity and composition of organic matter in sediments. The results of long-term studies of the qualitative and quantitative development of the benthos animals in Lake Sevan and its tributaries, as well as in the outlet River Hrazdan, show that using benthos as an indicator of water pollution of different origin gives workable data. Due to pollution, the species composition in some areas was changed. The organisms that preferred clean water (Trichoptera, Plecoptera) were replaced by organisms that are resistant to water pollution (Tubificidae, Chironomidae).

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The influence of salinity on the response of the estuarine teleost, Tilapia guineensis fingerlings to acute toxic effects of inorganic nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) (15: 15: 15) fertilizer was investigated using semi-static bioassay, The toxicity of NPK fertilizer was found to increase significantly with increase in the salinity level from 0.05 parts per thousand to 32.4 parts per thousand. The 96 hr LC50 value at salinity of 32.4 parts per thousand, was 0.11 mg/l and was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the toxicity values at any other salinity level of media evaluated. The implication of the findings is that pollution control standards and/or safe limits for brackish water ecosystem should consider variations in salinity regimes for greater relevance and reliability.

SO WATER-ENERGY-FOOD NEXUS: HUMAN-ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY IN THE
   ASIA-PACIFIC RING OF FIRE
SE Global Environmental Studies
AB Otsuchi Town, Japan, suffered significant damage due to the large tsunami in 2011. Rich groundwater and an ecosystem that contains several rare species characterized life in the town before the tsunami. Attracting more visitors to the town is necessary to sustain its economy going forward. This study aimed to identify factors that would increase visitors to the town. A survey of 6262 individuals, residing in nine locations in East Japan and sampled from a survey panel of an Internet research firm, showed that providing learning opportunities with regard to the local ecosystem and disaster recovery activities in Otsuchi would increase individual visitors from those locations by one to six percentage points. The increased publicity of the town after the tsunami is a key driving force in drawing visitors. The provision of information regarding learning opportunities is influential in attracting visitors who have an extensive interest in traveling and learning. These visitors enjoy experiences such as tasting water from natural resources, learning about different ecosystems, and participating in cultural activities. People who are uninterested in traveling or who have a limited range of interest in natural water, ecosystem, or culture are, however, not influenced by such information.

TI Detection of Cr6+ by the Sulfur Oxidizing Bacteria Biosensor: Effect of
   Different Physical Factors
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A biosensor based on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) for detection of toxic chemicals in water was developed. SOB are acidophilic microorganisms that get their energy through the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds in the presence of oxygen to produce sulfuric acid. The reaction results in an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and a decrease in pH. The bioassay is based on the inhibition of SOB in the presence of toxic chemicals by measuring changes in EC and pH. The effect of different physical factors such as HRT, inorganic sulfur (S degrees) particle size, and temperature on detection of Cr6+ was studied. The detection of Cr6+ (50 ppb) was improved by decreasing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 30 to 10 mm and increasing S degrees particle size from 1 to 4.75 mm. Detection time was shorter at 30 degrees C compared to 45 degrees C and the SOB were active over a wide range of temperatures with a maximum temperature for growth at 45 degrees C. This novel biosensor is simple, highly sensitive to low Cr6+ concentrations (50 ppb), and also minimizes detection time. The present findings can be applied to the proper continuous screening of water ecosystem toxicity.

TI Removal Efficiency of the Herbicide Oxadiazon in Treatment Processes for
   Drinking Water
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN SOCIETY FOR APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A comparative study was performed to evaluate the removal efficiency of herbicide, oxadiazon as an organic contaminant in treatment processes for drinking water. In this investigation, three major treatment processes such as chlorination, ozonation and activated carbon treatment were applied separately to water system. The level of oxadiazon gradually decreased to 28%, when chloride as a disinfectant was applied to the water supply. Activated carbon treatments showed that this herbicide was removed efficiently from the aqueous solution. The results indicated that the performance of powdered activated carbon was more effective than granular activated carbon in terms of adsorption. The adsorption isotherms exhibited an excellent agreement with the experimental data and they were also well represented by the Langmuir and Freundlich equations, indicating the higher adsorption capacity for activated carbons. During ozone treatment, 50% of oxadiazon was removed but this removal was enhanced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The association of ozonation with chloride and activated carbon treatments was considered to be the best-tested treatment for drinking water production. Therefore, if oxadiazon enters into the water ecosystem as an organic contaminant, it could be removed effectively by the drinking water treatment processes.

SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
CT 26th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium on Geomorphology and Ecosystems
CY 2005
CL Buffalo, NY
AB The relationship between form and function has been a central organizing principle in biology throughout its history as a formal science. This concept has been relevant from molecules to organisms but loses meaning at population and community levels where study targets are abstract collectives and assemblages. Ecosystems include organisms and abiotic factors but ecosystem ecology too has developed until recently without a strong spatially explicit reference. Landscape ecology provides an opportunity to once again anneal form and function and to consider reciprocal causation between them. This ecomorphologic view can be applied at a variety of ecologically relevant scales and consists of an investigation of how geomorphology provides a structural template that shapes, and is shaped by ecological processes. Running water ecosystems illustrate several principles governing the interaction of landscape form and ecological function subsumed by the concept of "Functional Ecomorphology". Particularly lucrative are ecosystem-level interactions between geologic form and biogeochemical processes integrated by hydrologic flowpaths. While the utility of a flowpath-based approach is most apparent in streams, spatially explicit biogeochemical processing pervades all landscapes and may be of general ecological application.

TI Derivation of cause-effect based sediment quality guidelines
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Unlike Canadian Water Quality Guidelines, Canadian Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ISQGs) are not based on clear cause-effect relationships. They were derived using a modified U.S. National Status and Trends Program (NSTP) approach in which biological effects were compared with contaminant concentrations in field-collected sediments. Exceeding an assessment value indicates an increased likelihood of toxic effects, but correlation is not proof of cause, and it cannot be assumed that the contaminant present in excess of the assessment value is necessarily responsible for the observed effects. This has sometimes caused confusion and misinterpretation of the toxicological significance of sediment chemistry data. An alternative approach to computing sediment guidelines, based on estimating the bioavailable contaminant concentration and comparing this with concentrations known to be toxic, is proposed. Examples are given of guidelines for cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc computed using both methods for toxicity data collected from sediments in Canadian Shield lakes near smelters. The cause-effect based guidelines can be much higher than those computed using the NSTP approach. They can also be higher than toxic thresholds estimated from experiments with metal-spiked sediments. Only true cause-effect based guidelines should be used for predicting the cause of toxicity in sediments.

TI A Neighborhood-Based Urban Water Carrying Capacity Assessment: Analysis
   of the Relationship between Spatial-Demographic Factors and Water
   Consumption Patterns in Tehran, Iran
SO LAND
AB The upward trajectory of urbanization, coupled with the ever-growing demand for more water resources, has led to increased pressure on limited water resources, particularly in cities with dry climates such as Tehran. Since the balance of Tehran's water ecosystems has been disturbed, and the quality and quantity of water resources have been affected in recent years, conducting an assessment of water environment carrying capacity (WECC) seemed vital for this city. WECC was used as the basis of water supply sustainability evaluation concerning Tehran's land use and demographic characteristics on a neighborhood scale. Therefore, the effect size and correlation of 12 types of land use and six variables derived from the literature with water consumption patterns were examined in warm and cold seasons. The results show that land use, population density, percentage of deteriorated area, percentage of buildings over 30 years old, residential-commercial land use, and green spaces correlate significantly with water consumption. The percentage of deteriorated areas and buildings over 30 years old has a negative, and the rest has a positive impact on water consumption. It is also recommended to use the research findings to improve Tehran's water environment carrying capacity and apply the proposed evaluation procedure to other cities. The results of this research can be used in planning large and densely populated cities with a neighborhood-oriented approach, in which local institutions play an essential role in attracting people's participation and inclusive urban planning.

TI Changes in High- and Low-Flow Regimes: a Diagnostic Analysis of Tropical
   Cyclones in the Western North Pacific
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB This study aims to determine the characteristics of hydrological behaviors in the basins of the representative multipurpose dams in the Korean Peninsula that depend on typhoon conditions for sustainable water management and restoration of the water ecosystem. Based on the annual maximum flow and seven-day low-flow results, trend analyses were conducted on hydrological changes, such as magnitude, timing, duration, and frequency of the extreme flows. Among the eight selected multipurpose dams in South Korea, the Chungju and Soyang dams have been subject to dramatic reduction of inflow during the spring and early summer. The Sumjin Dam was indicated the most sensitive to the severity and magnitude of typhoons and it showed a statistically significant increase in the frequency and duration of peak inflows resulting from such typhoons. As regards low flow, the Chungju and Andong dams showed a distinct reduction in this flow in the winter, but the changes resulting from typhoons were relatively subtle. This diagnostic study is expected to provide foundational data to examine the causalities related to the streamflow patterns of Korean basins. In addition, the study could aid in establishing basin-customized mid- and long-term measures for supplying of water resources in the environmental system and for managing the effects of natural disasters by analyzing various hydrological changes related to extreme events.

   freshwater bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Microcystis aeruginosa is a water bloom-forming cyanobacterium found in fresh and brackish water ecosystems worldwide. Previously, we showed that several instances of M. aeruginosa bloom in brackish water can be explained by the proliferation of salt-tolerant M. aeruginosa strains harboring genes for a compatible solute sucrose. However, evolutionary history of sucrose genes in M. aeruginosa remains unclear because salt-tolerant strains have been poorly described. Here, we characterized a novel salt-tolerant strain of M. aeruginosa (NIES-4325) isolated from the brackish water of Lake Abashiri, Japan. A whole-genome analysis of M. aeruginosa NIES-4325 identified genes for sucrose synthesis (sppA, spsA and susA). Quantitative sucrose and gene expression analyses suggested that sucrose is implicated in acclimation to high salt in NIES-4325. Notably, the sucrose genes of M. aeruginosa are monophyletic, yet sucrose genes of NIES-4325 are highly divergent from those of other salt-tolerant M. aeruginosa strains. This suggests an early sucrose gene import into M. aeruginosa from other cyanobacteria, followed by multiple losses during intraspecific diversification. One of a few survivors of salt-tolerant strains is a likely donor of recent horizontal spreads of sucrose genes across M. aeruginosa lineages.

TI Carbohydrates and polyphenolics of extracts from genetically altered
   plant acts as catalysts for in vitro synthesis of silver nanoparticle
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES
AB Eco-friendly biosynthetic approach for silver nanoparticles production using plant extracts is an exciting advancement in bio-nanotechnology and has been successfully attempted in nearly 41 plant species. However, an established model plant system for systematically unraveling the biochemical components required for silver nanoparticles production is lacking. Here we used Arabidopsis thaliana as the model plant for silver nanoparticles biosynthesis in vitro. Employing biochemical, spectroscopic methods, selected mutants and over-expressor plants of Arabidopsis involved in pleotropic functions and sugar homeostasis, we show that carbohydrates, polyphenolics and glyco-proteins are essential components which stimulated silver nanoparticles synthesis. Using molecular genetics as a tool, our data enforces the requirement of sugar conjugated proteins as essentials for AgNPs synthesis over protein alone. Additionally, a comparative analysis of AgNPs synthesis using the aqueous extracts of some of the plant species found in a brackish water ecosystem (Gracilaria, Potamogeton, Enteromorpha and Scendesmus) were explored. Plant extract of Potamogeton showed the highest potential of nanoparticles production comparable to that of Arabidopsis among the species tested. Silver nanoparticles production in the model plant Arabidopsis not only opens up a possibility of using molecular genetics tool to understand the biochemical pathways and components in detail for its synthesis.

TI Inducible Tolerance to Agrochemicals Was Paved by Evolutionary Responses
   to Predators
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent research has reported increased tolerance to agrochemicals in target and nontarget organisms following acute physiological changes induced through phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, the most inducible populations are those from more pristine locations, far from agrochemical use. We asked why do populations with no known history of pesticide exposure have the ability to induce adaptive responses to novel agrochemicals? We hypothesized that increased pesticide tolerance results from a generalized stressor response in organisms, and would be induced following sublethal exposure to natural and anthropogenic stressors. We exposed larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) to one of seven natural or anthropogenic stressors (predator cue (Anax spp.), 0.5 or 1.0 mg carbaryl/L, road salt (200 or 1000 mg Cl-/L), ethanol-vehicle control, or no-stressor control) and subsequently tested their tolerance to a lethal carbaryl concentration using time-to-death assays. We observed induced, carbaryl tolerance in tadpoles exposed to 0.5 mg/L carbaryl and also in tadpoles exposed to predator cues. Our results suggest that the ability to induce pesticide tolerance likely arose through evolved antipredator responses. Given that antipredator responses are widespread among species, many animals might possess inducible pesticide tolerance, buffering them from agrochemical exposure.

TI Interaction between water ecosystems and the catchment surface by the
   example of the Ob'-Irtysh catchment area
SO CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
AB The interaction of water basins and watercourses with the catchment surface in the Ob'-Irtysh catchment area is considered. The results of long-term observation of water, suspended matter, and bottom sediments in different segments of the watercourse are summarized and compared. The interaction of major and minor tributaries, natural and artificial water reservoirs with the catchment area is discussed in the context of industrial discharge of heavy metals. The areal distribution of metals along the Ob' River is heterogeneous. The chemical composition of water in the upper reaches of Ob' is determined by mercury and complex ore shows; in the middle and lower reaches, by catchments, of major tributaries: Tom, Chulym, and, particularly, Irtysh. The Novosibirsk Reservoir purifies the water from coarse suspensions. Wetlands of the catchment enrich the main watercourse in metals and organic matter. Anthropogenic pollution from large cities (Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Surgut, and Nizhnevartovsk) additionally contaminate the watercourse. With abundance of organic matter, heavy metals are accumulated in bottom sediments and, as a consequence, in tissues of predatory fish. The results of long-term studies indicate that oil products and phenols are the main hazard for the middle and lower Ob' River, especially at elevated water temperatures.

TI Simulation of a water ecosystem in a landscape lake in Tianjin with
   AQUATOX: Sensitivity, calibration, validation and ecosystem prognosis
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB The parameters involved in AQUATOX of the relatively large lakes do not have widespread applicability in landscape lakes. To get a series of model parameters of landscape lakes, an AQUATOX model was developed for SH landscape lake in Tianjin. The parameter sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation were carried out in this study. Moreover, the model was applied to predict the changes of nutrient with different species in SH. The results of parameter sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is highly sensitive to the optimal temperature, maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration rate. The results from calibration and validation have revealed that the AQUATOX model did a good simulating for SH. Furthermore, the AQUATOX provided necessary information for management of SH. Based on the prognosis under different scenarios, the biomass of Bullhead and plants should be controlled to remain the water quality of SH in a good condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Different Approaches to Assessing Pollution Load: The Case of
   Nitrogen-Related Grey Water Footprint of Barley and Soybean in Argentina
SO WATER
AB Agriculture is among the main causes of water pollution. Currently, 75% of global anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads come from leaching/runoff from cropland. The grey water footprint (GWF) is an indicator of water resource pollution, which allows for the evaluation and monitoring of pollutant loads (L) that can affect water. However, in the literature, there are different approaches to estimating L and thus contrasting GWF estimates: (A1) leaching/runoff fraction approach, (A2) surplus approach and (A3) soil nitrogen balance approach. This study compares these approaches for the first time to assess which one is best adapted to real crop production conditions and optimises GWF calculation. The three approaches are applied to assess N-related GWF in barley and soybean. For barley in 2019, A3 estimated a GWF value 285 to 196% higher than A1, while in 2020, the A3 estimate was 135 to 81% higher. Soybean did not produce a GWF due to the crop characteristics. A3 incorporated N partitioning within the agroecosystem and considered different N inputs beyond fertilization, improving the accuracy of L and GWF estimation. Providing robust GWF results to decision-makers may help to prevent or reduce the impacts of activities that threaten the world's water ecosystems and supply.

TI Removal of atrazine herbicide through granular activated carbon filters
   associated with microorganisms in drinking water treatment
SO ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
AB Atrazine is a synthetic herbicide commonly used to control weeds and foliage in crops, and is a major contaminants of soil and water ecosystems. Many methods have been suggested to remove herbicides from drinking water. However, these methods are very costly, many have performance problems, produce a lot of toxic intermediates which are very harmful and dangerous. However, atrazine is susceptible to degradation by microorganism present in water, sediment, and sewage effluents. Considering these aspects, the main objective of the study was to investigate the biodegradation and filtration for using biological activated carbon (BAC) filters to remove atrazine, and their phylogenetic identification associated with these microorganisms. The results showed that atrazine was biodegraded by microorganism present in the biofilm, with removal over 80% in BAC filters. The microorganisms found integrate to the group of bacteria, composed by the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, and Pseudomonas. This study allows us to infer the ability to biodegrade atrazine by bacteria present in BAC filters and capacity to remove herbicides by BAC filters, and the possible use of this technology as an alternative for the control and removal of this substance in water treatment.

TI PHYTOPLANKTON DIVERSITY AND BIOMASS DURING WINTER WITH AND WITHOUT ICE
   COVER IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Most scenarios of the predicted climate change in Europe imply that the increasing temperature trend will be maintained in winter seasons. The presence or absence of the ice cover in winter can impact on the functioning of lake ecosystems. The research was carried out in two mesotrophic and dimictic lakes in winter with and without ice cover. The biomass and phytoplankton and its composition was analysed with reference to physical factors (PAR and temperature). The research proved that poor thermal-light conditions under the ice/snow cover favoured the development of nanoplanktonic species from the genus Cryptomonas (Cryptophyta) or Stephanodiscus (Bacillariophyceae), whereas microplanktonic species of dinoflagellates, diatoms or green algae prevailed during the ice-free winter. The highest phytoplankton biomass and species richness were recorded during ice-free winter, which affected a higher Shannon-Wiener diversity index and evenness. It has been shown that the mild winter creates good conditions for the development of phytoplankton species characteristic for the mixing periods. The lack of inverse thermal stratification during winter can lead to disturbance in the functioning of the water ecosystems throughout the year.

TI NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION POTENTIAL IN AN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED IN
   NORTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
SO WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN
AB A 155,947 ha portion of the Shenango River watershed in western Pennsylvania was evaluated as to the potential impact of agriculture drainage on water quality. Approximately a third of the area is being used as either cropland or pasture with approximately an equal percentage in forest lands. Eleven subwatersheds were evaluated as to their potential for nonpoint source pollution according to the criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources for the Chesapeake Bay Pollution Abatement Program. The individual components and overall rating for each subwatershed were then evaluated as to their correlation with four water quality variables based on 104 samples collected at 26 sampling stations throughout the watershed. There was a significant correlation between the overall rating factor for each subwatershed and each of the four water quality variables. In general, the watershed delivery factor, animal nutrient factor, and management factors were correlated with fecal coliform and phosphorus in the receiving streams, whereas the ground water delivery factor appeared to be more important in determining nitrate concentrations in these streams. These results indicate that manure and nutrient management, along with the exclusion of livestock from streams and the enhancement and/or replacement of riparian wetlands, are important approaches in reducing agricultural impacts in fresh water ecosystems.

This study aimed to map phytoplankton and zooplankton composition consisting of freshwater and marine plankton from the lagoon to the marine entrance in the west part of Segara Anakan Cilacap. The survey method was taken with purposive random sampling in fourteen stations and four replicates with new and full moon conditions from March to April 2018 in a wet season. The result showed 52 species of plankton. All species belonged to phylum Cyanophyta (9 species), Chlorophyta (13 species), Chrysophyta (19 species), Euglenozoa (2 species), Rotifera (2 species) and Arthropoda (7 species). Of the 52 species collected in all stations and replicates, phytoplankton has a greater species richness (41 species) than zooplankton (11 species). And also, freshwater plankton (47 species) has a higher species richness than marine plankton (5 species) due to the wet season condition causing freshwater enters brackish water. The largest freshwater of River Citanduy enters the brackish water of Segara Anakan mangrove ecosystem in Cilacap and causing the freshwater phytoplankton abundance, especially Staurastrum sp. in inland waters of Segara Anakan Cilacap.

TI Fecal indicator bacteria and zoonotic pathogens in marine snow and
   California mussels (Mytilus californianus)
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Pollution of nearshore waters with disease-causing microorganisms impacts ecosystems health through illness and deaths in people and wildlife, as well as negative socioeconomic consequences of impaired marine resources. Insight on pathogen ecology in coastal habitats is crucial for accurately mitigating inputs and impacts of microbial pollution. Three objectives were addressed to (i) compare fecal pollution in proximity to (a) freshwater runoff, and (b) endemic marine wildlife; (ii) evaluate presence and magnitude of fecal microorganisms in marine snow and mussels and (iii) determine if pathogens in mussels and FIB levels in seawater or mussels are correlated. Sampling during the wet season, proximity to freshwater, and FIB levels in mussel homogenates (but not seawater) were associated with pathogen presence in mussels. Pathogens and FIB were enriched in aggregate-rich fractions, further supporting an important role of marine snow in pathogen transmission. The lack of association between FIB in surrounding waters and presence of pathogens in mussels calls into question current regulations for insuring safe seafood to consumers in the United States, and alternative monitoring approaches such as direct testing for select pathogens should be further evaluated.

TI Leaf-associated fungal diversity in acidified streams: insights from
   combining traditional and molecular approaches
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB We combined microscopic and molecular methods to investigate fungal assemblages on alder leaf litter exposed in the benthic and hyporheic zones of five streams across a gradient of increasing acidification for 4 weeks. The results showed that acidification and elevated Al concentrations strongly depressed sporulating aquatic hyphomycetes diversity in both zones of streams, while fungal diversity assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) appeared unaffected. Clone library analyses revealed that fungal communities on leaves were dominated by members of Ascomycetes and to a lesser extent by Basidiomycetes and Chytridiomycetes. An important contribution of terrestrial fungi was observed in both zones of the most acidified stream and in the hyporheic zone of the reference circumneutral stream. The highest leaf breakdown rate was observed in the circumneutral stream and occurred in the presence of both the highest diversity of sporulating aquatic hyphomycetes and the highest contribution to clone libraries of sequences affiliated with aquatic hyphomycetes. Both methods underline the major role played by aquatic hyphomycetes in leaf decomposition process. Our findings also bring out new highlights on the identity of leaf-associated fungal communities and their responses to anthropogenic alteration of running water ecosystems.

TI Environmental study of some metals on several aquatic macrophytes
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Aquatic macrophytes can be used in the study of quality of water ecosystems and in monitoring of metals and other pollutants. This study was focused on assessment of metals accumulation in certain aquatic macrophytes (biomonitors), in comparison with water and sediment (abiotic monitors) of the lake. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu and Pb were measured in water, sediment and plant samples, namely in stems and leaves of Bidens tripartitus L., Polygonum amphibium L., Lycopus europaeus L. and in roots, stems and leaves of two aquatic plants, Typha angustifolia L. and Typha latifolia L. The concentrations of all investigated metals were higher in sediment than in water. The mean concentrations of metals in macrophytes were sequenced: Fe > Mn > Cu > Pb. This study exhibited different metals concentration in aquatic plants, depending on the plant organ. The highest concentrations of Fe and Pb were recorded in root of T. latifolia L. As means of Mn and Cu, their concentrations were higher in stems and leaves of different investigated species. The application of macrophytes can be possible in finding of solutions for problems of protection, sanation and revitalization of different aquatic ecosystems.

TI THE EFFECTS OF MOTORWAY RUNOFF ON FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS .2. IDENTIFYING
   MAJOR TOXICANTS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Previous studies have provided prima facie evidence that runoff from the M1 motorway, UK, affects both the quality of the receiving water and the biota living there, in sites short distances from point sources -i.e., possible worst-case situations. Because discharges contain a wide variety of contaminants, both the identification of toxicants and the establishment of causal relationships between observed changes in water/sediment quality and biology are often difficult. In this particular case, the problem was addressed by conducting a series of toxicity tests using the benthic amphipod Gammarus pulex. The abundance of this species was greatly reduced downstream of the point where motorway runoff entered the stream. Stream water contaminated with motorway runoff was not toxic to G. pulex. However, exposure to contaminated sediments resulted in a slight reduction in survival over 14 d, and sediment manipulation experiments identified hydrocarbons, copper, and zinc as potential toxicants. Spiking experiments confirmed the importance of hydrocarbons, and fractionation studies indicated that most of the observed toxicity was due to the fraction containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Animals exposed to contaminated sediments and water spiked with sediment extract accumulated aromatic hydrocarbons in direct proportion to exposure concentrations.

TI Large-scale Degradation of the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The Tocantins-Araguaia Basin is one of the largest river systems in South America, located entirely within Brazilian territory. In the last decades, capital-concentrating activities such as agribusiness, mining, and hydropower promoted extensive changes in land cover, hydrology, and environmental conditions. These changes are jeopardizing the basin's biodiversity and ecosystem services. Threats are escalating as poor environmental policies continue to be formulated, such as environmentally unsustainable hydropower plants, large-scale agriculture for commodity production, and aquaculture with non-native fish. If the current model persists, it will deepen the environmental crisis in the basin, compromising broad conservation goals and social development in the long term. Better policies will require thought and planning to minimize growing threats and ensure the basin's sustainability for future generations.

TI Epizootics of epizootic ulcerative syndrome among estuarine fishes of
   Kerala, India, under post-flood conditions
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), primarily caused by the water mold Aphanomyces invadans, is an OIE-notifiable disease, having potential impacts on fisheries. We report EUS epizootics among estuarine fishes of Kerala, India, during 2018, under post-flood conditions 3 decades after its primary outbreak. Six fish species (Mugil cephalus, Platycephalus sp., Scatophagus argus, Arius sp., Planiliza macrolepis and Epinephelus malabaricus) were infected, including the first confirmed natural case in E. malabaricus and P. macrolepis. Salinity, surface temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH of water during the epizootics were < 2 ppt, 25 degrees C, 4.1 ppm and 7.0. The presence of zoonotic bacterial pathogens (Aeromonas veronii, Shewanella putrefaciens, Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) in tissues of affected fish indicates that EUS-infected fish may pose a public health hazard if not handled properly. Lack of clinical evidence in the region during the last 3 decades, a high number of affected fishes, including 2 new fish species, the severity of skin lesions and very low water salinity (< 2 ppt) during the outbreak in contrast to historical water salinity records suggest relatively recent invasion by A. invadans. Phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene showed that the same clone of pathogen has spread across different continents regardless of fish species and ecotypes (fresh/estuarine environments). Altogether, the present study provides baseline data which can be applied in EUS management strategies within brackish-water ecosystems. We recommend strict surveillance and development of sound biosecurity measures against the disease.

TI Negative effects of a piscicide, rotenone, on the growth and metabolism
   of three submerged macophytes
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB A piscicide, rotenone (RT), is frequently used for clear and management of aquatic systems such as fish pond, and even for illegal fishing throughout the world. The effects of RT on submerged macrophytes remain elusive although the effects of RT on many kinds of animals are well documented. We wanted to determine the effects of RT on the growth and metabolism of three submerged plants (Vallisneria natans, Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton maackianus) and try to find the reasons of these effects. The results showed that the shoot height, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, root:shoot ratios, contents of soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate of the three tested submerged plants were significantly negatively affected by RT and the effects were different among the studied species. Furthermore, pH rised a little and light transmission was greatly reduced in the water with RT treatment. We think that the negative effects of RT on the growth and metabolism of submerged species is partially attributing to the lower light caused by RT application. Accordingly, we highlight that submerged species may be greatly suppressed by RT, and we should apply RT in water ecosystems with great caution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Water Environmental Functional Zoning at County Level and Environmental
   Contamination Carrying Capacity Accounting in the Mainstream of Xiaofu
   River
SO WATER
AB Water environmental functional zoning is the crucial method to implement the targeted management of environmental factors, which is significant to protect the structure and function of the water ecosystem. Xiaofu River is the main river in Zibo City, which is a typical industrial city in northern China. This paper analyzes the water functional zoning of the Xiaofu River at the provincial and municipal levels. Thereinto, based on the catchment attribute and differentiated management requirement, the functional zone of the mainstream of Xiaofu River is divided into 5 first-level and 14 s-level water functional zones, where the environmental contamination carrying capacity of every functional zone is calculated and checked. It is suggested that the total amount of pollutants discharged into each functional zones should be further controlled and reduced in the future to restore the ecological functions of Xiaofu River.

TI Current knowledge and potential impacts of climate change on New
   Zealand's biological heritage
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB While global climate change is impacting biota across the world, New Zealand's maritime climate is highly variable and relatively mild, so climate change is sometimes seen as a minimal threat to species and ecosystems especially in comparison to the more immediate threat of invasive species. However, climate change will alter rainfall patterns, increase the incidence and severity of extreme events, and gradually increase temperatures which will all modify terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Our comprehensive review of reported climate change impacts in New Zealand indicates that most measured impacts to date are due to indirect impacts (such as exacerbation of invasive species impacts) and most are in the marine realm. Ocean acidification and marine heatwaves are particularly problematic for calcareous organisms and algae respectively. Other notable impacts include thermal squeeze in the alpine zone and impacts of drought on freshwater fish. Very small populations of rare and threatened species can be very vulnerable to extreme events (e.g. fire, floods). While the evidence for climate change impacts is sparse in some regions and for some ecosystems, we encourage ongoing monitoring to identify processes of decline that may need to be mitigated. We identify five key research needs to improve our understanding of the threat of climate change to the biodiversity of Aotearoa New Zealand.

TI The future of temporary wetlands in drylands under global change
SO INLAND WATERS
AB The Andalusian International University held a workshop entitled Temporary wetlands' future in drylands under the projected global change scenario in March 2020 in Baeza, Spain, with 26 participants from 10 countries. The workshop objectives were to promote international cooperation and scientific exchange on the conservation and protection of temporary wetlands. The participants highlighted the extreme conditions that temporary and permanent wetlands, ponds, and shallow lakes are currently facing and predicted a dismal future for these systems due to climate change. To foster a holistic view of these ecosystems, the workshop included wetland watersheds. It was concluded that the main threats are those affecting water quality and quantity as well as egg-seed banks, species population dynamics, and food webs. The inherent characteristics of waterbodies in drylands, including high resilience and resistance to harsh conditions, are already negatively impacted by direct human actions and climate change. Another threat is the time lag between scientific warnings about threats and the social and political concern leading to mitigating actions. Thus, more effective actions to protect and conserve temporary wetlands are essential. Research networks could help stimulate the necessary conservation actions, but the global recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic will pose a challenge as economies are burdened with urgent expenditure. This special issue of the journal Inland Waters is the outcome of the workshop presentations and is composed of the ensuing papers on wetlands in drylands.

TI Submerged Vegetation and Water Quality Degeneration From Serious
   Flooding in Liangzi Lake, China
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB In shallow lake ecosystems, flooding is a key disturbance factor of aquatic vegetation. Aquatic plants, especially submerged plants, play key roles in water ecosystems. Liangzi Lake experienced severe flooding in July 2010, and the elevated water levels lasted for 3 months. In this study, 10 transects with 120 monitoring points were set up for monthly monitoring during the 3-year period, encompassing the period before and after the flooding (2009-2011). The numbers, biomass, and diversity of the submerged plants, as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake water, were surveyed. There were 12 species belonging to 7 families and 7 genera in Liangzi Lake. Eleven of the submerged plant species were found in 2009, but, after the flood, that number decreased to five in 2011. The total biomass differed significantly over the three years (P < 0.05), with the largest biomass in 2009 and smallest in 2011. In 2009 and 2010, Potamogeton maackianus was the dominant species, but its dominant position weakened in 2011. After the flood, water transparency decreased, and the water depth, turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus increased. A redundancy analysis between the submerged plants and environmental factors found that the water transparency, turbidity, and water depth were the key environmental factors affecting the plants. These results suggest that the long-lasting severe flooding of Liangzi Lake in 2010 led to the degradation of both the submerged plant community and water quality.

TI Water Ecosystem Services in Northern Australia-How Much Are They Worth
   and Who Should Pay for Their Provision?
SO PLOS ONE
AB There is ongoing pressure to develop the largely unaltered Daly River catchment in northern Australia for agriculture. However, a choice experiment among people in the region and in Australia's largest city, Sydney, shows that people are prepared to pay substantial amounts to maintain the quality of its ecosystem services. The total stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a Daly River conservation programme was about $300, of which people would be willing to pay over half ($161) if the programme retained waterholes for Aboriginal people in good condition. The WTP for high quality recreational fishing and biodiversity values was $120 and $91 respectively. Using the average cost of a recreational fishing license in Australia ($35) as a basis for grounding the stated preferences in empirical values, as well as the cost of park entry fees and the amount of support society provides to agriculture in Australia, the total amount that the 110,000 people in the region are likely to be willing to pay for the retention of the values in the Daly River catchment is about $6 million, while the 4.5 million people in Sydney would be willing to pay about $81 million. A significant finding in this research is that, while fishing, biodiversity and agricultural values all have equivalents in the market economy, the value for which people were willing to pay most, the cultural value, has no equivalent at all and is thus receives almost no investment.

TI Sustainability in the Food-Water-Ecosystem Nexus: The Role of Land Use
   and Land Cover Change for Water Resources and Ecosystems in the
   Kilombero Wetland, Tanzania
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) has a significant impact on water resources and ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). On the basis of three research projects we aim to describe and discuss the potential, uncertainties, synergies and science-policy interfaces of satellite-based integrated research for the Kilombero catchment, comprising one of the major agricultural utilized floodplains in Tanzania. LULCC was quantified at the floodplain and catchment scale analyzing Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery applying different adapted classification methodologies. LULC maps at the catchment scale serve as spatial input for the distributed, process-based ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) simulating the changes in the spatial and temporal water balance in runoff components caused by LULCC. The results reveal that over the past 26 years LULCC has significantly altered the floodplain and already shows an impact on the ecosystem by degrading the existing wildlife corridors. On the catchment scale the anomalies of the water balance are still marginal, but with the expected structural changes of the catchment there is an urgent need to increase the public awareness and knowledge of decision makers regarding the effect of the relationship between LULCC, water resources and environmental degradation.

TI Estimating Dynamics of Terminal Lakes in the Second Largest Endorheic
   River Basin of Northwestern China from 2000 to 2017 with Landsat Imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Quantifying terminal-lake dynamics is crucial for understanding water-ecosystem-economy relationship across endorheic river basins in arid environments. In this study, the spatio-temporal variations in terminal lakes of the lower Heihe River Basin were investigated for the first time since the Ecological Water Diversion Project commenced in 2000. The lake area and corresponding water consumption were determined with 248 Landsat images. Vital recovery of lakes occurred two years after the implementation of the project, and the total lake area increased by 382.6%, from 30.7 to 148.2 km(2), during 2002-2017. East Juyan Lake (EJL) was first restored as a project target and subsequently reached a maximum area of 70.1 km(2). Water dispersion was initiated in 2003, with the East river prioritized for restoration. Swan Lake in the East river enlarged to 67.7 km(2) by 2017, while the other four lakes temporarily existed or maintained an area < 7 km(2), such as West Juyan Lake. Water consumed by lakes increased synchronously with lake area. The average water consumption of the six lakes was 1.03 x 10(8) m(3)/year, with 63% from EJL. The increasing terminal lakes; however, highlight the seasonal competition for water use between riparian vegetation and lake ecosystems in water-limited areas.

TI Bogota River anthropogenic contamination alters microbial communities
   and promotes spread of antibiotic resistance genes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria has raised global concern regarding the future effectiveness of antibiotics. Human activities that influence microbial communities and environmental resistomes can generate additional risks to human health. In this work, we characterized aquatic microbial communities and their resistomes in samples collected at three sites along the Bogota River and from wastewaters at three city hospitals, and investigated community profiles and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as a function of anthropogenic contamination. The presence of antibiotics and other commonly used drugs increased in locations highly impacted by human activities, while the diverse microbial communities varied among sites and sampling times, separating upstream river samples from more contaminated hospital and river samples. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistant pathogens and ARGs were more abundant in contaminated water samples. Tracking of resistant determinants to upstream river waters and city sources suggested that human activities foster the spread of ARGs, some of which were co-localized with mobile genetic elements in assembled metagenomic contigs. Human contamination of this water ecosystem changed both community structure and environmental resistomes that can pose a risk to human health.

TI An Overview of Ecological Indicators of Fish to Evaluate the
   Anthropogenic Pressures in Aquatic Ecosystems: From Traditional to
   Innovative DNA-Based Approaches
SO WATER
AB In order to halt the loss of global biodiversity and considering the United Nations Decade for Ocean Conservation Agenda, increasing efforts to improve biomonitoring programs and assessment of ecosystem health are needed. Aquatic environments are among the most complex to monitor, requiring an array of tools to assess their status and to define conservation targets. Although several parameters need to be considered for a comprehensive ecological status assessment, it is important to identify easy-to-apply high-resolution monitoring methods. Shifts in fish composition and abundance are often good indicators of ecosystem health status in relation to anthropogenic activities. However, traditional monitoring methods are strictly related to the habitat under study and cannot be applied universally. This review summarizes the importance of ecological indicators for aquatic environments subjected to anthropogenic stressors, with a particular focus on fish communities and transitional water ecosystems. We describe the main characteristics of both traditional and novel methods for fish monitoring, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings in an attempt to identify simple and reliable ways for a correct evaluation of the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.

TI Assessing Water Security in Water-Scarce Cities: Applying the Integrated
   Urban Water Security Index (IUWSI) in Madaba, Jordan
SO WATER
AB Water security is a major concern for water-scarce cities that face dynamic water challenges due to limited water supply, climate change and increasing water demand. Framing urban water security is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainties of the definitions and assessment frameworks concerning urban water security. Several studies have assessed water security by granting priority indicators equal weight without considering or adapting to the local conditions. This study develops a new urban water security assessment framework with application to the water-scarce city of Madaba, Jordan. The study applies the new assessment framework on the study area and measures urban water security using the integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a decision management tool to prioritise and distinguish indicators that affect the four dimensions of urban water security: drinking water, ecosystems, climate change and water-related hazards, and socioeconomic aspects (DECS). The integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) highlights the state of water security and intervention strategies in Madaba. The study reveals that urban water security in Madaba is satisfactory to meet basic needs, with shortcomings in some aspects of the DECS. However, Madaba faces poor security in terms of managing climate- and water-related risks. The IUWSI framework assists with a rational and evidence-based decision-making process, which is important for enhancing water resources management in water-scarce cities.

TI Drone-Based Characterization of Seagrass Habitats in the Tropical Waters
   of Zanzibar
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Unmanned automatic systems (UAS) are increasingly being applied as an alternative to more costly time-consuming traditional methods for mapping and monitoring marine shallow-water ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate the utility of combining aerial drones with in situ imagery to characterize the habitat conditions of nine shallow-water seagrass-dominated areas on Unguja Island, Zanzibar. We applied object-based image analysis and a maximum likelihood algorithm on the drone images to derive habitat cover maps and important seagrass habitat parameters: the habitat composition; the seagrass species; the horizontal- and depth-percent covers, and the seascape fragmentation. We mapped nine sites covering 724 ha, categorized into seagrasses (55%), bare sediment (31%), corals (9%), and macroalgae (5%). An average of six seagrass species were found, and 20% of the nine sites were categorized as "dense cover" (40-70%). We achieved high map accuracy for the habitat types (87%), seagrass (80%), and seagrass species (76%). In all nine sites, we observed clear decreases in the seagrass covers with depths ranging from 30% at 1-2 m, to 1.6% at a 4-5 m depth. The depth dependency varied significantly among the seagrass species. Areas associated with low seagrass cover also had a more fragmented distribution pattern, with scattered seagrass populations. The seagrass cover was correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.9, p < 0.01) with sea urchins. A multivariate analysis of the similarity (ANOSIM) of the biotic features, derived from the drone and in situ data, suggested that the nine sites could be organized into three significantly different coastal habitat types. This study demonstrates the high robustness of drones for characterizing complex seagrass habitat conditions in tropical waters. We recommend adopting drones, combined with in situ photos, for establishing a suite of important data relevant for marine ecosystem monitoring in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO).

TI Inland capture fisheries: status and data issues
SO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY
AB Lakes, reservoirs and wetlands cover a total area of about 7.8 million km(2) and provide a rich environment for inland capture fisheries. Production from the world's inland capture fisheries has grown steadily to over 11.6 million tonnes in 2012, with almost 95% of the catches from developing countries. The sector is composed primarily of small-scale fishers and provides employment to approximately 61 million people, of which 50% are women. Inland capture fisheries yield is only 6.3% of the global reported fish production (capture fisheries and aquaculture). However, it is proposed that this is an underestimate and actual yield may be several times greater. The apparent low proportion of fish provided by inland capture fisheries globally does not reflect adequately the importance of inland capture fisheries in today's society. A lack of accurate information renders analysis of existing data sets difficult and makes decision-making problematic. Is the sector in serious trouble because of the multiple uses of and threats to inland water ecosystems? Is the sector stable and increased production due only to better reporting? Or, is the sector growing?

TI Wetlands and global climate change: the role of wetland restoration in a
   changing world
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Global climate change is recognized as a threat to species survival and the health of natural systems. Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impacts resulting from climate change. Climate change will make future efforts to restore and manage wetlands more complex. Wetland systems are vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses to climate change and the implications for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level, making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plans will require examination by habitat. Flood-plains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands, peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse habitats, with different stressors and hence different management and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh and India), Mekong river delta (Vietnam), and southern Ontario (Canada) are examples of major wetland complexes where the effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus, successful long term restoration and management of these systems will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effects of climate change. How will we choose priorities for restoration and research? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged, water-starved wetland ecosystems? This is a policy paper originally produced at the request of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and incorporates opinion, interpretation and scientific-based arguments.

TI MOIRA-PLUS: A decision support system for the management of complex
   fresh water ecosystems contaminated by radionuclides and heavy metals
SO COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
AB The accidental release of radioactive substances into the environment leads to the necessity of applying suitable countermeasures for the restoration of the polluted environment. However, despite their obvious benefits, such interventions may result in detrimental effects of an economic, ecological and social nature that must be carefully evaluated. MOIRA-PLUS is a PC-based user-friendly, computerised decision support system (DSS) that helps decision makers to choose optimal countermeasure strategies for different kinds of aquatic ecosystems and contamination scenarios.
   The DSS MOIRA-PLUS is based on:
   (a) Validated models to evaluate the behaviour of radionuclides in contaminated water bodies and biota and to assess the effect of countermeasures on contamination levels;
   (b) Models to assess the radiation dose to people and biota (fish) by relevant exposure pathways, the effect of countermeasures, and the associated economic impact;
   (c) A multi-attribute analysis (MAA) module to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasure strategies by accounting for the social, ecological and economic detriments and costs in relation to their benefits;
   (d) A software system consisting of: (1) software realisation of the mathematical models; (2) a Geographic Information System (GIS) and associated databases to select the aquatic system of interest and, if necessary, the default environmental data required to run the models: (3) a graphical user interface (GUI): (4) an operating system connecting all the above parts.
   The flexible structures of the environmental models implemented in MOIRA-PLUS DSS give the potential for the application of these models to several other types of pollutants, such as heavy metals. The DSS can be applied to complex water systems comprising lakes, reservoirs and rivers. In this paper, the main principles underpinning the functioning of the DSS MOIRA-PLUS are described and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Marine botanical communities in southern Mozambique: Sea grass and
   seaweed diversity and conservation
SO AMBIO
AB Sea grasses together with mangroves and coral reefs are known to be the most productive communities in shallow-water ecosystems. In southern Mozambique, south of Maputo Bay, the marine botanical communities can be divided into sea grass and seaweed types. Sea grass occurs in the dark sandy areas of sheltered locations and the seaweed in rocky sandstone areas with high hydrodynamics. Sea-grass beds are exploited quite intensively for fishing activities and by collectors of edible marine invertebrates. At least 20 nets and 100 collectors were observed each day during the spring-tide period (15 days per month) around Inhaca Island. The present study emphasizes aspects of sea grass and seaweed biodiversity and conservation of these ecologically important communities.

TI Ecological assessment of water quality in the Kabul River, Pakistan,
   using statistical methods
SO OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB We identified 209 species of algae and cyanobacteria at 4 sites in the Kabul River. Green algae, diatoms, and charophytes dominated in the river, which reflects regional features of agricultural activity. Species richness and algal abundance increased down the river. The Water Quality Index characterizes the quality of water down the river as medium to bad. The index of saprobity S reflects Class III water quality. The Water Ecosystem Sustainability Index (WESI) shows contamination with nutrients. According to the River Pollution Index (RPI), waters in the river have low alkalinity and low salinity, and are contaminated with nutrients. Pearson coefficients showed that water temperature plays a major role in the total species richness distribution (0.93*) and in the green algae distribution (0.89*), while cyanobacteria were stimulated also by water salinity (0.91*). Stepwise regression analysis indicated water temperature as the major regional factor that determines riverine algal diversity. Surface plots and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that salinity, nitrates, temperature, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) can be defined as major factors affecting algal diversity. Dendrites mark the upper site of the Warsak Dam as the source of the community species diversity. Bioindication methods can give relevant and stable results of water quality and self-purification assessment that can be employed to monitor the regional water quality.

TI The river Mesta case study: A qualitative model of dissolved oxygen in
   aquatic ecosystems
SO ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB The dynamics of the dissolved oxygen in water bodies is the result of complex interactions involving physical and biological processes. Understanding how the balance of these influences determines the amount of oxygen available for living organisms is a key factor to interpret the water body conditions, and eventually to use dissolved oxygen as an indicator of the water quality. In this paper we present a Qualitative Reasoning model developed to improve understanding of changes in the amount of dissolved oxygen in different segments of the river Mesta in Bulgaria. Effects on dissolved oxygen result from changes in physical, chemical and biological processes induced both by natural and anthropogenic activities within the watershed. To explore the possibility of establishing a landmark value that may change according to specific conditions, we developed the concept of flexible value mapping, which dynamically captures changes in the dependencies between the landmark value and the values of other quantities as the conditions of the system change during the simulations. The paper also discusses the concept of dominance of a specific process over other competing processes affecting a quantity. With the model described here, we aim to discuss possible solutions to interesting modelling problems and to provide the community of ecological modellers support for educational activities and water resources management.

   Bewick's Swan - Fennel Pondweed system
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
CT 5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes
CY JUN 05-09, 2005
CL Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS
AB (T)he role of aquatic macrophytes in stimulating biodiversity and maintaining clear waters is currently undisputed. The management of (eutrophic) shallow waters is therefore often directed at (re-)establishing macrophyte domination. In contrast, the role of water birds has long been considered of minor importance for the functioning of fresh water ecosystems. Indeed, in terms of biomass and production, water birds constitute only a minor part of these systems. However, water birds may graze heavily on water plants under certain circumstances, and the question arises whether herbivorous water birds have an important indirect effect on shallow fresh water systems. Mainly illustrated with the interaction between Bewick's Swans and Fennel Pondweed, we present data on the role that water plants may play in the life of water birds and how water birds may impact water plants' fitness in terms of survival, production, dispersal and competitive ability. It appears that water plants may be crucial for water birds during periods of high-energy requirements, such as migration. Despite the plants' costs associated with water bird grazing, the interaction between water birds and water plants varies in nature from an apparent predator-prey relationship to a mutually beneficial interaction depending on the context and the perspective. For the case of the Bewick's Swan-Fennel Pondweed interaction, regular bird grazing is sustainable and may actually favour the plant's dispersal. Thus, Bewick's Swans themselves may in fact play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the Fennel Pondweed rich staging sites between the swans' wintering and breeding grounds, which are vital for the swans' successful migration.

TI Global Occurrence of Cyanobacteria: Causes and Effects (Review)
SO INLAND WATER BIOLOGY
AB This review is devoted to analyzing the global occurrence of cyanobacteria in water ecosystems, the possible causes of this phenomenon, and its consequences. In recent decades, cyanobacteria have been rapidly expanding in waterbodies all over the world. This expansion is accompanied by water pollution with dangerous cyanotoxin metabolites that represents a significant threat to humans, animals, and the environment. Purifying water of cyanobacteria is a serious problem, because it is necessary to eliminate toxins and the unpleasant taste and odor of drinking water, as well as fight the biocorrosion caused by cyanobacterial fouling. Cyanobacterial blooms concern not only issues related to the water supply, but also to fishing, the recreational use of waterbodies, and tourism. Global warming and climate change, the increasing eutrophication of natural waters, and anthropogenic pollution, as well as the unique physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria and their ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions, including extreme environments, are among the main factors contributing to the expansion of cyanobacteria.

TI Effects of fluoride on morphology, growth, development, and thyroid
   hormone of Chinese toad (Bufo gargarizans) embryos
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS
AB Excessive fluoride in natural water ecosystem has the potential to detrimentally affect amphibians, but little is known of such effects or underlying mechanisms in Bufo gargarizans embryos. In the present study, the effects of fluoride exposure on B. gargarizans embryos were investigated. First, fluoride teratogenic experiment showed that the 9 days EC50 of fluoride on B. gargarizans embryos was 177.62mg/L. Then, we studied the sublethal effects of fluoride on B. gargarizans embryos at control, 0.7, 4.1, 19.6, 41.9, and 62.7mg/L fluoride concentration. Malformation, growth, and development of embryos were monitored, and type 2 and 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2 and Dio3), thyroid hormone receptors (TR and TR) mRNA levels were measured. Our results showed the morphological malformations, such as tail curvature (lordosis), edema, cuticularized ciliated cells, and hyperplasia were occurred during fluoride exposure. Growth and development were all inhibited at 19.5, 41.9, and 62.7mg/L fluoride-treated groups after 9days' exposure. According to real-time PCR results, exposure to fluoride upregulated Dio3 and TR mRNA expression and downregulated Dio2 and TR mRNA level. All above indicated that excessive fluoride could induce morphology malformations, inhibit embryonic growth and development, and disrupt the normal function of maternal thyroid hormone in B. gargarizans embryos.

TI Physicochemical characteristics, community assemblages, and food web
   structure in anchialine pools along the Kona Coast on the Island of
   Hawaii, USA
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Anchialine pools are unique localized brackish water ecosystems, comprised of fresh groundwater and saltwater from the ocean mixing through subterranean pathways. This study characterized physicochemical properties, biological communities, and food web structures in anchialine pools on Hawaii Island, hypothesizing pronounced differences between pools with and without introduced fishes. Pools varied greatly in size, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen saturation. On average, 46% of observed species were introduced. Native species of high conservation concern such as the shrimp Metabetaeus lohena and Halocaridina rubra were not observed in pools with introduced fishes, where periphytic algal biomass was lower. delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses revealed an unusual food web structure where all animal species (except Gambusia affinis) occupied the same trophic niche, independent of species, size, and sex. These findings illustrate that simple food web structures with opportunistic feeding patterns in all species can occur in ecosystems that have greatly variable physicochemical properties and diverse biological communities. The wide variation in biological communities even in adjacent pools indicates that individual anchialine pools are unique. The high proportion of introduced species and their observed effects on these fragile ecosystems suggest that they pose a serious threat to native biota in Hawaiian anchialine pools.

TI Effects of Deicing Salt in Protected Areas: Water Quality Monitoring in
   the River Basin with the Occurrence of a Rare Pearl Mussel
SO INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY
AB The effects of deicing salt on water ecosystems have been studied in the Sumava National Park and Protected Landscape Area. A pilot study was conducted in the Upper Vltava River basin, a habitat of the strictly protected pearl mussel. Dataloggers were used to investigate conductivity, often recommended as an important indicator of water quality.
   In this pilot project two pairs of dataloggers were installed in two streams crossed by the roads with different road maintenance regime. The first site was established in location, where deicing salt has not been allowed at all, but preliminary results of soil and vegetation monitoring indicated some impacts of deicing salts in this location. The records from dataloggers confirmed this, but conductivity was not so high at the second site. The second site was established on a priority road, permanently maintained by deicing salt. In this site, we often recorded conductivity higher than 75 mu S/cm, water quality limit for suitable habitats of the strictly protected pearl mussel. High conductivity may negatively affect viability of the population.
   From a methodological point of view, there are two main outputs of this pilot project. (1) We found that dataloggers can be frozen and out of records in shallow water during longer frost period. (2) We also confirmed hypotheses that not all ions are transported rapidly through the soil and groundwater. Conductivity was lower during winter and increased with snow melting. During vegetation season dataloggers recorded decrease of conductivity after heavy rains or longer rain period. Conductivity increased again in dry period.
   We conclude that the dataloggers improve our knowledge of impact of deicing salt in water ecosystems and offer relevant arguments for EIA in the area of high conservation value. Of course more statistical analyses are necessary; more detail information about annual differences in weather conditions and amount of deicing salt applied in different locations (not only a total amount of salt for a whole road) could help to interpret our data.

TI Ilyocryptus spinifer Herrick 1882 (Crustacea, Branchiopoda, Cladocera):
   The First Record of the Species in the European Fauna
SO BIOLOGY BULLETIN
AB In 2018, the water flea, Ilyocryptus spinifer Herrick 1882 (Cladocera, Ilyocryptidae), was found for the first time in the Vetluga River, Nizhny Novgorod Region, European Russia. This species with a benthic phytophilic mode of life belongs to the southern thermophilous complex of cladocerans and shows a circumtropical distribution pattern. So far, I. spinifer has never been found in Europe, sporadic records of this species were known only from few southern regions in the Asian part of Russia. The invasion of I. spinifer to relatively high latitudes may be related to a natural distribution range expansion due to global climate warming, to transfers via migratory birds, and/or with ballast waters in ships. In any case, further monitoring of the revealed populations is very important to control the water ecosystem conditions in Russia and other countries.

SO OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB The structure of plankton in a lowland river was studied with a particular focus on autotrophic as well as heterotrophic picoplankton cells. Water samples were collected in the middle, meridional section of the Warta River in 2005. Heterotrophic picoplankton (HPP) were represented by bacteria varying in size and form, but mainly by cocci and rods. HPP abundance ranged from 3.5 x 10(6) to 9.5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) densities were considerably lower and ranged from 1.2 x 10(3) to 92 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). They were represented by prokaryotes (picocyanobacteria) and eukaryotes (small chlorophytes). Both components occurred together but eukaryotic APP usually prevailed in terms of biomass. In terms of biomass, APP seemed to play a minor role in this ecosystem in comparison with heterotrophic picoplankton.

TI Exotic snails dominate nitrogen and carbon cycling in a highly
   productive stream
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Individual animal species can impact ecosystem processes, but few exotic invaders have demonstrated ecosystem-scale impacts, even when population sizes are large. We combined whole-stream measures of carbon and nitrogen fluxes with rates of consumption and ammonium excretion to show that an exotic freshwater snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, dominated these fluxes in a highly productive stream. The snails consumed 75% of gross primary productivity, and their excretion accounted for two-thirds of ammonium demand. Such large fluxes were due to high snail biomass rather than high rates of excretion or consumption. This exotic species may dramatically alter ecosystem function in rivers, with potential consequences for food web structure and element transport.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB A large number of antibiotic residues are discharged into aquatic environments due to the widespread use of antibiotics in daily life. After a series of processes in the water, the residues will potentially have adverse impacts on water ecosystem and human health. Therefore, it is critical for mediating the pollution to know how the antibiotics transport and distribute in the water. This study utilizes a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model to find out the transport and distribution of antibiotics in a highly polluted area, the Laizhou Bay in China. Furthermore, the model was used to simulate two scenarios in the Laizhou Bay, the antibiotics from sewage treatment plants and the contamination of mariculture. The simulated results show that the model as an effective tool can provide a useful basis for the management of antibiotics-related environmental issues in the Laizhou Bay.

TI Exploitation alternatives of olive mill wastewater: production of
   value-added compounds useful for industry and agriculture
SO BIOFUEL RESEARCH JOURNAL-BRJ
AB Countries producing olive oil generate a considerable amount of olive mill wastewater (OMWW), one of the most harmful agro-industrial effluents with a powerful polluting capacity. In fact, owing to its high pollution load, this effluent is extremely toxic to the whole soil-air-water ecosystem as well as to the living organisms inhabiting it (i.e., plants, animals, aquatic organisms, microorganisms, etc.). Currently, OMWW is discarded but since it includes carbohydrates, organic acids and mineral nutrients, as well as elevated contents of phenolics and other natural antioxidants compounds, it could be considered as a potential source of high value-added natural products. Therefore, the valorization of different waste streams including OMWW into fine biochemicals and the recovery of valuable metabolites via biotechnological processes is probably the main challenge faced by the olive oil industry. In light of that, the aim of the present review article is to summarize the state-of-the-art in relation to the exploitation possibilities and the use of OMWW to generate added-value compounds of great significance for the biofuel, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical, food, and agriculture industries. Valorization of this significant waste steam in particular through a biorefinery platform could substantially enhance the environmental sustainability aspects of the whole industry while simultaneously contributing to the improvement of its economic viability.

AB The wastewaters coming from mining operations usually have low pH (acidic) values and high levels of metal pollutants depending on the type of metals being extracted. If unchecked, the acidity and metals will have an impact on the surface water. The organisms and plants can adversely be affected and this renders both surface and underground water unsuitable for use by the communities. The installation of a treatment plant that can handle the wastewaters so that pH and levels of pollutants are reduced to acceptable levels provides a solution to the prevention of polluting surface and underground waters and damage to ecosystems both in water and surrounding soils. The samples were collected at five points and analyzed for acidity, total suspended solids, and metals. It was found that the pH fluctuated between pH 2 when neutralization was forgotten and pH I I when neutralization took place. The levels of metals that could cause impacts to the water ecosystem were found to be high when the pH was low. High levels of metals interfere with multiplication of microorganisms, which help in the natural purification of water in stream and river bodies. The fish and hyacinth placed in water at the two extremes of pH 2 and pH I I could not survive indicating that wastewaters from mining areas should be adequately treated and neutralized to pH range 6-9 if life in natural waters is to be sustained.

TI Taxonomic and functional structure of aquatic insect assemblages in
   headwaters from upland grasslands (Cordoba, Argentina)
SO LIMNETICA
AB Although headwater streams play a key role in drainage catchments, they are among the most threatened habitats on earth. Natural open-canopy headwaters, in particular, have received little research attention in contrast to the most worldwide studied forested catchments. Then, the aim of this study was to assess the taxonomic and functional structure of insect assemblages in grassland headwaters contrasting three different habitats in two hydrological periods. Functional composition was quantified considering trophic and habit traits. We assessed the degree of assemblage overlapping among three habitat units (riffles, pools and macrophyte patches) and the differences in taxonomic and functional metrics among these stream habitats. Assemblages in macrophytes and riffles were rather overlapped and separated from the assemblage in pools. Macrophyte patches held the greatest insect abundance but richness and diversity were higher in riffles. Functional richness and diversity followed the same pattern found for the taxonomic analysis: higher in riffles, intermediate in macrophytes and lower in pools. The multivariate approach performed with functional groups concurred with the taxonomic analysis, being assemblages functionally different among habitats. Assemblages were dominated by gathering collectors, but the combined analysis of trophic and habit traits allowed disentangling the use of different habitats since collectors were mainly clingers in riffles and sprawlers in pools and macrophyte patches. Habitat characteristics affected the dominant habit within gathering collectors, with potential consequences for ecosystem processes (e.g. processing rates of fine organic material). This study provides valuable information on the taxonomic and functional structure of the insect community in grassland headwaters that can be useful for stream management and conservation.

TI Adapting global conservation strategies to climate change at the
   European scale: The otter as a flagship species
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Climate change has created the need for new strategies in conservation planning that account for the dynamics of factors threatening endangered species.
   Here we assessed climate change threat to the European otter, a flagship species for freshwater ecosystems, considering how current conservation areas will perform in preserving the species in a climatically changed future. We used an ensemble forecasting approach considering six modelling techniques applied to eleven subsets of otter occurrences across Europe. We performed a pseudo-independent and an internal evaluation of predictions. Future projections of species distribution were made considering the A2 and B2 scenarios for 2080 across three climate models: CCCMA-CGCM2, CSIRO-MK2 and HCCPR HAD-CM3. The current and the predicted otter distributions were used to identify priority areas for the conservation of the species, and overlapped to existing network of protected areas.
   Our projections show that climate change may profoundly reshuffle the otter's potential distribution in Europe, with important differences between the two scenarios we considered. Overall, the priority areas for conservation of the otter in Europe appear to be unevenly covered by the existing network of protected areas, with the current conservation efforts being insufficient in most cases. For a better conservation, the existing protected areas should be integrated within a more general conservation and management strategy incorporating climate change projections. Due to the important role that the otter plays for freshwater habitats, our study further highlights the potential sensitivity of freshwater habitats in Europe to climate change.

TI Macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland streams under horticultural
   impact (Buenos Aires, Argentina)
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB This study aimed to determine the impact of horticultural land use on the taxonomic composition and the composition of functional feeding groups of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland streams. Three streams running through intensively cultivated plots were compared to three less impacted streams, two of which run through a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Nutrient and pesticide measured concentrations, as well as the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with aquatic vegetation, were analyzed in each stream. These concentrations were higher at the horticultural streams, negatively correlated to the richness, density, and diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages, leading to a dominance of tolerant families. The trophic structure of the macroinvertebrates assemblages was dominated by collector-gatherers in the horticultural streams, while all functional feeding groups were more equally distributed in less impacted streams. We concluded that horticulture reduces biodiversity and changes the trophic structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblage, eventually affecting stream functions. Mitigation measures are required to preserve the structure and function of these ecosystems.

TI Separating Biogenic and Adsorbed Pools of Silicon in Sediments Using
   Bayesian Inference
SO SILICON
AB There are several potentially mobile pools of silicon in sediment, e.g. biogenic Si (BSi), dissolved Si and adsorbed Si (AdSi) which makes the studying of a single pool very difficult because of the interference caused by other Si pools. In order to evaluate the impact that different Si pools have on the Si cycle of water ecosystems, it is important to have reliable estimates of the pool sizes. The objective of this study was to estimate the joint concentration distributions of two pools, AdSi and BSi, in, of a small catchment area in southern Finland. The potential correlation between BSi and AdSi was studied to find out if the AdSi pool can be inferred from the total pool (BSi + AdSi). The potential error caused by simultaneous extraction of AdSi in BSi determinations was also investigated. Because all extraction methods include variability due to measurement imprecision and inter-sample variation, the different sources of variation were explicitly separated to be able to infer the underlying true variation of AdSi and BSi within the study area. We have utilized Bayesian inference for this task.

TI Spatial-temporal evolution and driving factors of grey water footprint
   efficiency in the Yangtze River Economic Belt
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB At present, the deterioration of the water ecosystem has constituted a bottleneck for the further development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). As a crucial indicator for evaluating the degree of water pollution, grey water footprint (GWF) is of great significance for rationally evaluating the water environment of the YREB. In this study, we calculated the GWF efficiency of the YREB based on the panel data of 9 provinces and 2 cities from 2005 to 2019. On this basis, spatiotemporal methods and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model were adopted to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and driving factors of GWF efficiency in the YREB. This study drew the following conclusions: (1) the GWF efficiency in the YREB was on an uptrend, with the average annual growth rates of the upstream, midstream and downstream being 17.35 %, 18.31 % and 17.8 % respectively from 2005 to 2019. (2) The GWF efficiency in the YREB showed a weak trend of polarization and the gap between different regions continued to widen. Besides, it was characterized by stability and owned a positive spatial correlation in both geographic distance and economic distance. (3) The improvement of the technology level, water use efficiency, wastewater treatment capacity, economic development level and the reduction in the industrial pollution intensity contributed positively to boosting the GWF efficiency. Meanwhile, the effect of environmental regulation made a significant negative contribution to GWF efficiency. Therefore, in the process of building the YREB, while emphasizing the coordinated development of the economy, all regions should also carry out joint pollution control.

TI Preparing Pd/Sn modified nickel foam electrode for nitrate removal from
   aqueous solutions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Nitrate pollution in ground water and surface water has been becoming a worldwide problem that poses a great challenge to steady water ecosystem and human health. Electrochemical reduction is a promising way to remove nitrate from water because of advantages. We prepared Pd/Sn modified nickel foam (NF) electrode according to a two-step electrodeposition method. The prepared NF-Pd/Sn electrode showed a micromorphology like "Karst Fengcong" with peaks, saddles and nadirs intertwined with each other. Pd-0 and Sn-0 were detected on the NF-Pd/Sn electrode and the mass ratio of Pd/Sn was 4.3/1. The NF-Pd/Sn electrode showed the highest reaction rate (k(obs): 0.543 h(-1)) and removal efficiency (94%) under the condition of 100 mg N/L, 0.05 mol/L Na2SO4 and -1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl sat. KCl. The highest N-2-selectivity (100%) was reached under the condition of 100 mg N/L, 0.05 mol/L NaCl and -1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl sat. KCl. The microstructure of NF-Pd/Sn electrode like "Karst Fengcong" could provide large specific surface area and more active sites for nitrate adsorption and electrocatalytic reduction in aqueous solution. The adsorption and the reduction reaction of nitrate on the surface of NF-Pd/Sn could increase the electric current response in the test system.

TI Effects of co-occurrence of invading Procambarus clarkii and Pomacea
   canaliculata on Vallisneria denseserrulata-dominated clear-water
   ecosystems: a mesocosm approach
SO KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS
AB Single invaders often substantially alter ecosystems, but the potential impacts by multiple invaders remain understudied. The golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) and the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) are two widespread coinvaders. To test the effects of co-occurrence of the two species on a clear-water macrophyte state, we performed a 20-day experiment in 16 mesocosms (4 contained only two snails, 4 contained only two crayfishes, 4 contained two snails and two crayfishes, and 4 controls). Comparing with the control, the leaf length, number, and biomass of Vallisneria denseserrulata had decreased in the snail-only and crayfish-only treatments. In the crayfish-only treatment, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids had increased compared with the control, while they did not differ between the snail-only and the control treatment. Nutrients and turbidity concentrations did not differ between the snail + crayfish and the crayfish-only treatment, and plant biomass did not differ between the snail + crayfish and the snail-only treatment. These findings suggest that golden apple snails mainly affected the lake ecosystem by plant grazing, while red swamp crayfishes disturbed the sediment by increasing nutrients in the water and through resuspension. These snail and crayfish together had mainly additive effects on macrophyte and the physico-chemical variables studied.

TI The Antimicrobial Properties of Silver Nanoparticles in Bacillus
   subtilis Are Mediated by Released Ag+ Ions
SO PLOS ONE
AB The superior antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are well-documented, but the exact mechanisms underlying Ag-NP microbial toxicity remain the subject of intense debate. Here, we show that Ag-NP concentrations as low as 10 ppm exert significant toxicity against Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium ubiquitous in the soil. Growth arrest and chromosomal DNA degradation were observed, and flow cytometric quantification of propidium iodide (PI) staining also revealed that Ag-NP concentrations of 25 ppm and above increased membrane permeability. RedoxSensor content analysis and Phag-GFP expression analysis further indicated that reductase activity and cytosolic protein expression decreased in B. subtilis cells treated with 10-50 ppm of Ag NPs. We conducted X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses to directly clarify the valence and fine structure of Ag atoms in B. subtilis cells placed in contact with Ag NPs. The results confirmed the Ag species in Ag NP-treated B. subtilis cells as Ag2O, indicating that Ag-NP toxicity is likely mediated by released Ag+ ions from Ag NPs, which penetrate bacterial cells and are subsequently oxidized intracellularly to Ag2O. These findings provide conclusive evidence for the role of Ag+ ions in Ag-NP microbial toxicity, and suggest that the impact of inappropriately disposed Ag NPs to soil and water ecosystems may warrant further investigation.

TI Adsorption and transformation of PAHs from water by a laccase-loading
   spider-type reactor
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) polluted waters has become a concern as a result of the widespread use of PAHs and their adverse impacts on water ecosystems and human health. To remove PAHs rapidly and efficiently in situ, an active fibrous membrane, laccase-loading spider-type reactor (LSTR) was fabricated by electrospinning a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA)/laccase emulsion. The LSTR is composed of beads-in-string structural core-shell fibers, with active laccase encapsulated inside the beads and nanoscale pores on the surface of the beads. This structure can load more laccase and retains higher activity than do linear structural core-shell fibers. The LSTR achieves the efficient removal/degradation of PAHs in water, which is attributed to not only the protection of the laccase activity by the core-shell structure but also the pre-concentration (adsorption) of PAHs on the surface of the LSTR and the concentration of laccase in the beads. Moreover, the effects of pH, temperature and dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration on the removal of PAHs by the LSTR, in comparison with that by free laccase, have been taken into account. A synergetic mechanism including adsorption, directional migration and degradation for PAH removal is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Geomorphology and hydrology of the Manche-a-Eau lagoon (Guadeloupe,
   French West Indies)
SO GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT
AB The Manche-a-Eau lagoon, brackish water ecosystem is subject not only daily to tide, trade winds but regularly to hurricanes. Morphological evolution is connected with the occurrence frequency of hurricanes. On the 2004 Institut Geographique National aerial photo, a 90 m grid was superimposed in a geographical information system. The 37 georeferenced sampling spots thus obtained were marked out on the field with a global positioning system. From aerial photos, the outline drawing allows morphological follow up since 1950. Depth was measured at 1437 spots with bathymetric perch and prob. Stream direction was established during stream and ebb tide using ribbon fixed upon the 37 spots and a compass. Water volumes at low and high tide allowed the calculation of the water renewal rate at each tide. The mapping follow-up shows outline and island stabilization because of the protecting effect of the mangrove trees ('shield' effect) and soil (root peat), small island aggregation/disaggregation depending on hurricane passing. The present bathymetry shows the lagoon filling and the channels digging. General streams are subject to trade-winds (SSE-NNW) and the coming and going tide movements. The up and down water generates a stream channel situated along the lagoon sides and around dips and sandbanks. The water renewal volume (14.8 %) at each tide, combined to an active and varied hydrodynamics, tends to improve the water quality in this system.

TI Treatment of organic pollutants by homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton
   reaction processes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Nowadays, the water ecosystem is being polluted due to the rapid industrialization and massive use of antibiotics, fertilizers, cosmetics, paints, and other chemicals. Chemical oxidation is one of the most applied processes to degrade contaminants in water. However, chemicals are often unable to completely mineralize the pollutants. Enhanced pollutant degradation can be achieved by Fenton reaction and related processes. As a consequence, Fenton reactions have received great attention in the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater effluents. Currently, homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes are being investigated intensively and optimized for applications, either alone or in a combination of other processes. This review presents fundamental chemistry involved in various kinds of homogeneous Fenton reactions, which include classical Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton, electro-Fenton, sono-electro-Fenton, and solar photoelectron-Fenton. In the homogeneous Fenton reaction process, the molar ratio of iron(II) and hydrogen peroxide, and the pH usually determine the effectiveness of removing target pollutants and subsequently their mineralization, monitored by a decrease in levels of total organic carbon or chemical oxygen demand. We present catalysts used in heterogeneous Fenton or Fenton-like reactions, such as H2O2-Fe3+(solid)/nano-zero-valent iron/immobilized iron and electro-Fenton-pyrite. Surface properties of heterogeneous catalysts generally control the efficiency to degrade pollutants. Examples of Fenton reactions are demonstrated to degrade and mineralize a wide range of water pollutants in real industrial wastewaters, such as dyes and phenols. Removal of various antibiotics by homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton reactions is exemplified.

TI Mayfly response to different stress types in small and mid-sized lowland
   rivers
SO ZOOKEYS
AB Freshwater ecosystems are endangered worldwide by various human pressures, resulting in dramatic habitat and species loss. Many aquatic invertebrates respond to disturbances in their habitat, and mayflies are among the most sensitive ones. Therefore, we investigated mayfly response to anthropogenic disturbances at 46 study sites encompassing slightly to heavily modified small and mid-sized lowland streams and rivers. Mayfly nymphs were sampled between April and September 2016 using a benthos hand net. A total of 21 species was recorded, with Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus, 1761) being the most frequently recorded one. Nevertheless, the taxa richness was rather low per site, i.e., between zero and nine. Assemblage structure had a high share of lower reaches and lentic (potamic and littoral) elements, and detritivores (gatherers/collectors and active filter feeders). This indicates that hydromorphological alterations lead to assemblage "potamisation" in small and mid-sized rivers. More mayfly species were related to higher oxygen concentration and lower water temperature, abundance of aquatic vegetation and total organic carbon. Additionally, the assemblage diversity and abundance were negatively associated with increasing intensive agriculture area at the catchment scale. This study confirms mayfly bio-indicative properties, i.e., their sensitivity to alterations of their habitat and pollution, but also provides new data related to mayfly response to the impacted environment. Those data can be used for management and protection activities of lowland rivers and their biota according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.

TI Nutrient Excretion Rates of Anadromous Alewives during Their Spawning
   Migration
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
AB Excretion is one of the processes through which anadromous fishes move marine-derived nutrients into freshwater ecosystems, but no direct estimates of nutrient excretion rates by anadromous fish exist. We estimated the mass-specific nutrient excretion rates of anadromous alewives Alosa pseudoharengus during their spring spawning migration into Bride Lake, Connecticut. Anadromous alewives excreted an average of 2.17 mu g of phosphorus per gram of wet fish mass per hour and 24.71 mu g of nitrogen. The mean N:P ratio (by mass) of nutrient excretion was 11.7. Most of the nitrogen excreted was in the form of NH(4)(+). Our results suggest that excretion by anadromous fish can affect local food webs and ecosystem function when ecosystems are relatively small and fish aggregate at high densities, such as at the peak of the spawning run.

SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB In the present study, we report on the responses of the picoplanktonic cyanoprokaryote Synechococcus sp. to a summer drawdown in a Mediterranean floodplain wetland, using water level decrease as a measure of the gradual increase of disturbance over time, defined as a ramp disturbance. Simulating the gradual confinement of fish biomass during the drought event in an enclosure study, we found that the density of Synechococcus did not change significantly in response to fish-mediated changes in trophic state and food web compared with a fishless control. Instead, we observed a positive correlation of water levels and Synechococcus abundance in all enclosures, indicative of a ramp response to the ramp disturbance. Planktonic organisms, although largely neglected by wetland scientists, seem to be very useful model organisms for identifying cause - effect mechanisms in wetland disturbance ecology.

AB The marine environmental problems of developing regions are a particular cause for concern because of the great dependence of their human populations on marine resources for survival, and because a significant portion of the world's natural heritage is threatened. Of the problems, the destruction of shallow-water ecosystems and organic (sewage) pollution are the most prominent. The environmental issues typical for Third World countries are clearly related to their socioeconomic conditions, so that attempts at solutions must possess an adequately broad perspective, i.e. they must consider all relevant aspects of a problem. There is also a great need to strengthen the capabilities of developing nations to care for their own environment.

TI Production and consumption-based water dynamics: A longitudinal analysis
   for the EU27
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper investigates the relationship between economic development and water pressures using a global Multiregional Input-Output model (MRIO) dataset that takes into account the increasingly connected global supply chains underlying the economic systems. In particular, we analyse differences in water indicator outcomes by income level among European Union countries (EU27) from 1995 to 2008, focusing specifically on production and consumption-based water metrics for the member states. We use panel fixed effects regressions to study the dynamics of adjustment of water resources alongside controlling for individual country heterogeneity. Our main results indicate that the effects differ substantially depending on the approach used for measurement, especially when we conditioned on the country economic development, indicating opposite trajectories of water consumption and-per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Furthermore, the analysis of the main components associated to water indicators highlight the role of water embodied in trade flows as the transmission mechanisms of the main effects. In particular, our estimates suggest that the growth path followed by the most developed areas in the EU27 is based on the externalisation of the environmental burden over the less developed European partners, and external developing countries. On the policy front, our findings call for the implementation of integrated water resources management, technological specific policies and the corresponding environmental regulation to combine the conservation of water ecosystems and sustainable economic growth at the national, supranational and global levels.

TI Evaluation of the Impacts of Land Use in Water Quality and the Role of
   Nature-Based Solutions: A Citizen Science-Based Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The present study explores the impact of different land uses on water quality in a Mexican basin and addresses key mitigation measures, with key measurements made by citizen scientists. The Amanalco-Valle de Bravo Basin reservoir is the major freshwater supply for Mexico City. By measuring physical-chemical and bacteriological parameters in creeks over 21 months and correlating them to land use areas, it was possible to understand the impacts of different land uses (urban, forest, riparian forests, and different agricultural systems) in water quality. The results show that the concentration of E. coli, nitrates, nitrites, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and total suspended solids were higher than the recommended reference levels, and that average oxygen saturation and alkalinity were lower than the recommended reference levels in most sites. The analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong relationship between water pollution and urban and agricultural land uses, specifically a higher impact of potato cultivation, due to its intensive use of agrochemicals and downhill tilling. There was a clear positive relationship between total forest area and riparian vegetation cover with improved water quality, validating their potential as nature-based solutions for the regulation of water quality. The results of the present study indicate the opportunities that better land management practices generate to ensure communities' and water ecosystems' health. This study also highlights the benefits of citizen science as a tool for raising awareness with regard to water quality and nature-based solutions, and as an appropriate tool for participative watershed management.</p>

   organisms: A systematic review in assessment, monitoring and biological
   impact
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Marine and land plastic debris biodegrades at micro- and nanoscales through progressive fragmentation. Oceanographic model studies confirm the presence of up to similar to 2.41 million tons of microplastics across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian subtropical gyres. Microplastics distribute from primary (e.g., exfoliating cleansers) and secondary (e.g., chemical deterioration) sources in the environment. This anthropogenic phenomenon poses a threat to the flora and fauna of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as ingestion and entanglement cases increase over time. This review focuses on the impact of microplastics across taxa at suggested environmentally relevant concentrations, and advances the groundwork for future ecotoxicological-based research on microplastics including the main points: (i) adhesion of chemical pollutants (e.g., PCBs); (ii) biological effects (e.g., bioaccumulation, biomagnification, biotransportation) in terrestrial and aquatic organisms; (iii) physico-chemical properties (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and biodegradation pathways in the environment (e.g., chemical stress, heat stress); and (iv) an ecotoxicological prospect for optimized impact assessments.

SO CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
AB The accumulation levels of anthropogenic Sr-90 and Cs-134 and Cs-137 radionuclides in the marsh frog have been studied in the areas of the Beloyarskii water-storage reservoir (an industrial storm-water discharge channel of the nuclear power station) and the Verkhnii Tagil water-storage reservoir (the Tagil River down-stream of the dam). No significant distinction in the radionuclide accumulation (Sr-90 and Cs-137) depending on the amphibian sex and age is detected. Comparable levels of the accumulation of radionuclides in the marsh frog, when compared to the other representatives of the water ecosystem, are estimated. An assumption of the presence of some unidentified source of radioactive contamination of marsh frogs has been made; cesium-137 may be transferred from it to the Tagil River by the frogs.

TI BIOACCUMULATION OF IRON IN THE FRESH-WATER CRAB (POTAMONAUTES WARRENI)
   FROM 3 INDUSTRIAL, MINE AND SEWAGE POLLUTED FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS IN
   THE TRANSVAAL
SO WATER SA
AB An investigation was made into the bioaccumulation of iron in the organs and tissues of the freshwater crab Potamonautes warreni (Calman) from 3 metal-polluted aquatic ecosystems. Differences in water and sediment iron concentrations were related to environmentally induced factors. The highest iron concentrations in the crab occurred in the gills, suggesting this organ to be the prime site for the absorption and/or loss of iron to/from the aquatic environment. Although no seasonal or gender-related tendency in iron concentrations in the various organs and tissues was detected, there appears to be an inverse relationship in the capacity of the crab to bioaccumulate iron with size. A brief discussion is given on the physical and chemical conditions which prevailed at the 3 sampling sites.

TI Spatio-temporal variations in ecosystem and CO2 sequestration in coastal
   lagoon: A foraminiferal perspective
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
AB Seasonal variability in fresh water influx and ingression of sea water establish a unique transition zone in Asia's largest coastal lagoon - the Chilika lake. The seasonal variability in water and sediment input has significant impacts on the ecosystem influencing the rate of CO2 sequestration. We have assessed the impact of seasonal variability on CO2 sequestration using foraminiferal analysis and grain size data end member modeling. Lake floor sediment samples were collected seasonally, besides in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters of the lake bottom water at fixed stations influenced by seasonally variable fresh and saline water influx. Low electrical conductivity, pH of bottom water and absence of calcareous foraminifera suggest that the region proximal to the river mouth has fresh water ecosystem and has very limited role in CO2 sequestration. The region near to the sea mouth experiences high energy condition and seasonally changes from brackish to marine water ecosystem are ideal for diversification and opportunistic populations of foraminifera, but not ideal for flourishing (high population) of calcareous foraminifera. Inter-mixing of fresh and saline sea water develops fresh to brackish water conditions with medium energy condition in the interior region. These locations are away from the river and sea mouths and have high calcareous foraminifera abundances, but low diversity along with high bottom water pH suggesting seasonal variations in the sinking of CO2. Like other shallow coastal areas, Ammonia beccarii and Ammonia tepida are the dominant calcareous species, but their smaller size suggests a seasonal stressed condition. The opening of new and artificial sea mouth has increased the inflow of sea water into the lagoon that maintains its brackish water conditions, suggested by significant increase in calcareous foraminifera abundance. The sinking of these calcareous foraminifera may enhance the rate of CO2 sequestration and reduce degassing of dissolved carbon carried by the fresh water to the atmosphere.

TI Source, distribution and emerging threat of micro- and nanoplastics to
   marine organism and human health: Socio-economic impact and management
   strategies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The nature of micro- and nanoplastics and their harmful consequences has drawn significant attention in recent years in the context of environmental protection. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an overview of the existing literature related to this evolving subject, focusing on the documented human health and marine environment impacts of micro- and nanoplastics and including a discussion of the economic challenges and strategies to mitigate this waste problem. The study highlights the micro- and nanoplastics distribution across various trophic levels of the food web, and in different organs in infected animals which is possible due to their reduced size and their lightweight, multi-coloured and abundant features. Consequently, micro- and nanoplastics pose significant risks to marine organisms and human health in the form of cytotoxicity, acute reactions, and undesirable immune responses. They affect several sectors including aquaculture, agriculture, fisheries, transportation, industrial sectors, power generation, tourism, and local authorities causing considerable economic losses. This can be minimised by identifying key sources of environmental plastic contamination and educating the public, thus reducing the transfer of micro- and nanoplastics into the environment. Furthermore, the exploitation of the potential of microorganisms, particularly those from marine origins that can degrade plastics, could offer an enhanced and environmentally sound approach to mitigate micro- and nanoplastics pollution.

TI Assessment of a delta N-15 isotopic method to indicate anthropogenic
   eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Increased anthropogenic delivery of nutrients to water bodies, both freshwater and estuarine, has caused detrimental changes in habitat, food web structure, and nutrient cycling. Nitrogen-stable isotopes may be suitable indicators of such increased nutrient delivery. In this study, we looked at the differences in response of macrophyte WIN values to anthropogenic N across different taxonomic groups and geographic regions to test a stable isotopic method for detecting anthropogenic impacts. Macrophyte delta(15)N values increased with wastewater input and water-column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration. When macrophytes were divided into macroalgae and plants, they responded similarly to increases in wastewater N, although macroalgae was a more reliable indicator of both wastewater inputs and water-column DIN concentrations. Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) delta(15)N increased uniformly with wastewater inputs across a geographic range. We used the relationship derived between S. alterniflora and relative wastewater load to predict wastewater loads in locations lacking quantitative land use data. The predictions matched well with known qualitative information, proving the use of a stable isotopic method for predicting wastewater input.

TI Organic phosphorus regeneration enhanced since eutrophication occurred
   in the sub-deep reservoir*
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Lake eutrophication remains a serious environmental problem of global significance, and phosphorus (P) plays a key role in lake eutrophication. Internal P loading, as a result of P release from sediments, is gathering more and more recognition as an important source governing the P availability in these ecosystems. Anoxic condition can promote the release of P associated with Fe oxides, which has already been a consensus. However, it is still unknown whether the anoxic conditions induced by eutrophication act to intensify or weaken the regeneration of organic P (Porg) in sediments. We selected the Hongfeng Reservoir, a typical sub-deep lake, to study the regeneration behaviours of C and P in the sediments buried before and after eutrophication. The results showed that Porg did not significantly increase with the rapid increase in organic C (Corg) since eutrophication occurred. Furthermore, the organic C/P ratio was much higher in sediments buried after eutrophication than in those buried before, which indicated that Porg regeneration had been significantly enhanced since eutrophication occurred. Based on C/P ratios, our estimation suggested that the Porg regeneration and P release from sediment to water approximately enhanced 45.2% +/- 8.7% and 34.5% +/- 9.8%, respectively. Elevated primary productivity (algae) and the corresponding hypoxic/anoxic condition, both caused by eutrophication, promoted P biogeochemical cycle in the sub-deep reservoir. This study further verifies the significant contribution of regenerated Porg to the internal P load, and highlights the importance of controlling P release from sediments in order to restore clear water ecosystems in sub-deep lakes or reservoirs.

TI Framing Scenarios of Binational Water Policy with a Tool to Visualize,
   Quantify and Valuate Changes in Ecosystem Services
SO WATER
AB In the Santa Cruz Watershed, located on the Arizona-Sonora portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, an international wastewater treatment plant treats wastewater from cities on both sides of the border, before discharging it into the river in Arizona. These artificial flows often subsidize important perennial surface water ecosystems in the region. An explicit understanding of the benefits of maintaining instream flow for present and future generations requires the ability to assess and understand the important trade-offs implicit in water-resource management decisions. In this paper, we outline an approach for modeling and visualizing impacts of management decisions in terms of rare terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, vegetation, surface water, groundwater recharge, real-estate values and socio-environmental vulnerable communities. We identify and quantify ecosystem services and model the potential reduction in effluent discharge to the U. S. that is under scrutiny by binational water policy makers and of concern to stakeholders. Results of service provisioning are presented, and implications for policy makers and resource managers are discussed. This paper presents a robust ecosystem services assessment of multiple scenarios of watershed management as a means to discern eco-hydrological responses and consider their potential values for future generations living in the borderlands.

TI Predictability of the impact of multiple stressors on the keystone
   species Daphnia
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Eutrophication and climate change are two of the most pressing environmental issues affecting up to 50% of aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of environmental change are complicated by inherent difficulties of predicting the long-term impact of multiple stressors on natural populations. Here, we investigated the impact of temperature, food levels and carbamate insecticides, in isolation and in combination, on current and historical populations of the freshwater grazer Daphnia. We used common garden and competition experiments on historical and modern populations of D. magna 'resurrected' from a lake with known history of anthropogenic eutrophication and documented increase in ambient temperature over time. We found that these populations response dramatically differed between single and multiple stressors. Whereas warming alone induced similar responses among populations, warming combined with insecticides or food limitation resulted in significantly lower fitness in the population historically exposed to pesticides. These results suggest that the negative effect of historical pesticide exposure is magnified in the presence of warming, supporting the hypothesis of synergism between chemical pollution and other stressors.

TI The effects of population density changes on ecosystem services value: A
   case study in Western Jilin, China
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB In recent decades, the semi-arid ecosystem of China's Western Jilin province has changed dramatically due to intensive human activities. This article simulated the population density in Western Jilin using a Kernel Density Estimation method and explored the influence of population density on both the value and structure of ecosystem services in various regions. The results showed that lower population density correlated with higher values of ecosystem services per unit area. Apart from food production value, the value of each type of ecosystem service per unit area decreased as population density increased, with the greatest change observed in the value of waste disposal and the lowest in the value of raw materials. Analysis of demographic change on the structure of ecosystem services value produced a Gourd Phenomenon. Sensitivity analysis showed that the sensitivity coefficient of farmland ecosystems was highest, followed by wetland ecosystems and water ecosystems. Therefore, we should restore farmland to grassland and wetland (with its associated rivers and lakes) when reconstructing the eco-environment in Western Jilin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Transboundary water resources are of significant importance for all the EECCA countries. The break-up of the Soviet Union and other States has created new borders and new transboundary waters. The region has now about 150 major transboundary rivers that form or cross borders between two or more countries, some 25 major transboundary and international lakes and some 100 transboundary aquifers. Many catchments drain into closed seas or into landlocked lakes and pollution transported by rivers to seas and lakes has a major influence on these ecosystems. Many industrial enterprises are situated in the basins of the rivers, and there are major concerns related to the contamination of the fresh water ecosystems. The present paper describes the project "Monitoring of the probable sources and mechanisms of pollution with radionuclides, toxic and chemically dangerous elements of the rivers Kura and Araks with their inflows on the territory of Armenia" which is an important component of the International Program "Joint international studies of the Caspian river basins' pollution on the territories of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia for the transboundary control".

TI ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON IN A PREALPINE
   LAKE
SO INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE
AB The seasonal distribution of autotrophic picoplankton in Lake Constance was investigated over four consecutive years.  Cell numbers varied seasonally and vertically over four orders of magnitude (10(2) to 10(6) cells ml-1).  A horizontal variation by a factor of 3 in abundance and biomass across the different parts of the lake was found during summer stratification.  Picoplankton peaks occurred during the phytoplankton spring bloom and in late summer.  Low values were characteristic for the clear-water phase in early summer and for autumn-winter.  This seasonal pattern differed from that of larger phytoplankton in Lake Constance and from the seasonal distribution of picoplankton known from other lakes and marine environments.  Picoplankton was predominated by chroococcoid cyanobacteia of about 0.6-mu-m3 biovolume.  The average cell size increased from winter until early summer.  Using HPLC pigment analysis, we identified zeaxanthin and beta-carotene as typical picoplankton pigments.  Results of the pigment analyses suggest that algae others than picocyano-bacteria may be more prominent in the picoplankton size class than derived from routine epifluorescence counting.

TI Resistance of Two Mediterranean Cold-Water Coral Species to Low-pH
   Conditions
SO WATER
AB Deep-water ecosystems are characterized by relatively low carbonate concentration values and, due to ocean acidification (OA), these habitats might be among the first to be exposed to undersaturated conditions in the forthcoming years. However, until now, very few studies have been conducted to test how cold-water coral (CWC) species react to such changes in the seawater chemistry. The present work aims to investigate the mid-term effect of decreased pH on calcification of the two branching CWC species most widely distributed in the Mediterranean, Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata. No significant effects were observed in the skeletal growth rate, microdensity and porosity of both species after 6 months of exposure. However, while the calcification rate of M. oculata was similar for all colony fragments, a heterogeneous skeletal growth pattern was observed in L. pertusa, the younger nubbins showing higher growth rates than the older ones. A higher energy demand is expected in these young, fast-growing fragments and, therefore, a reduction in calcification might be noticed earlier during long-term exposure to acidified conditions.

TI Effects of aquaculture on the shallow lake aquatic ecological
   environment of Lake Datong, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB Background The restoration of lake ecosystems requires a good knowledge of the lake's history and the driving mechanism of environmental changes. In this study, we used Lake Datong, the largest inland lake in Hunan Province China, as an example to study the effects of aquaculture, based on historical data of aquatic creature, diatom inferred-total phosphorous (DI-TP) data, and an Ecopath model. Lake Datong has undergone several stages of aquaculture from 1980, with a rapid increase in fish production and fish feed supplementation at each stage. Its water quality has deteriorated since the introduction of aquaculture and the lake has become moderate eutrophic status. Results According to the DI-TP data, before 1930, Lake Datong was in a mesotrophic status (50-60 mu g/L DI-TP). Between 1930 and 1980, the number of nutrient-tolerant species increased slightly, which indicates a nutrient increase in the lake (66-83 mu g/L DI-TP). From the 1980s to 2010 and especially since 2000, eutrophication increased rapidly, with eutrophic species dominating the diatom assemblage, such as Stephanodiscus hantzschii, S. minutulus, and a sudden decrease in Aulacoseira granulata (< 10%). The annual average DI-TP concentration was 202 mu g/L. After 2010, DI-TP decreased to 127-152 mu g/L. In 2019, consumer biomass in Lake Datong was very low because the large-scale aquaculture was restricted by local government. The biomass of submerged macrophytes was relatively high, indicating that excessive primary producers had not been used by consumers and therefore, had not entered the food web. This led to a reduction in the energy transfer efficiency (TE) of the ecosystem. Conclusions The succession of the water ecosystem of Lake Datong is reappeared by DI-TP analysis and historical reference data. Lake Datong has experienced four stages of eutrophication succession following the introduction of aquaculture activities, with dramatic changes in the composition and biomass of its aquatic creatures. After comprehensive management in 2017, the consumer biomass of Lake Datong was at a relatively lower level, and the biomass of submerged macrophytes was higher, meaning a large quantity of primary producers had not been used by consumers, thus had not entered the food web, which consequently reduces the energy TE of the ecosystem. Future management needs to pay attention to making a suitable macrophyte harvest plan, stocking herbivorous and omnivorous fish, and establishing rational fishing, which can not only enhance the energy flows and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, but also improve the food web structure. Our results provide important reference values and theoretical support for decision-makers and stakeholders in the subsequent management of similar shallow lake-water ecosystems.

TI Can Amphibians Help Conserve Native Fishes?
SO FISHERIES
AB Native fish populations have continued to decline worldwide despite advances in management practices. As such, new approaches are needed to complement the old. In many flowing and standing waters, larval amphibians are the dominant vertebrate taxa. This can be important to fisheries due to amphibians' ability to influence macroinvertebrate communities, alter benthic habitat, and supply nutrients in aquatic systems. These changes can, in turn, affect the ecology and fitness of other aquatic organisms such as fishes. Due to their large effects in some systems, it is suggested that fisheries managers carefully consider actions that may affect amphibian populations and actively conserve them in some cases. Preservation of riparian areas and amphibian-associated microhabitats may even be used as a tool to positively impact freshwater fisheries by conserving amphibians that help maintain aquatic systems. Therefore, knowledge of local amphibian life histories and behaviors may be important in conserving associated freshwater fisheries.

TI Disentangling the Effects of Multiple Stressors on Large Rivers Using
   Benthic Invertebrates-A Study of Southeastern European Large Rivers with
   Implications for Management
SO WATER
AB Predicting anthropogenic actions resulting in undesirable changes in aquatic systems is crucial for the development of effective and sustainable water management strategies. Due to the co-occurrence of stressors and a lack of appropriate data, the effects on large rivers are difficult to elucidate. To overcome this problem, we developed a partial canonical correspondence analyses (pCCA) model using 292 benthic invertebrate taxa from 104 sites that incorporated the effects of three stressors groups: hydromorphology, land use, and water quality. The data covered an environmental gradient from near-natural to heavily altered sites in five large rivers in Southeastern Europe. Prior to developing the multi-stressor model, we assessed the importance of natural characteristics on individual stressor groups. Stressors proved to be the dominant factors in shaping benthic invertebrate assemblages. The pCCA among stressor-groups showed that unique effects dominated over joint effects. Thus, benthic invertebrate assemblages were suitable for disentangling the specific effect of each of the three stressor groups. While the effects of hydromorphology were dominant, both water quality and land use effects were nearly equally important. Quantifying the specific effects of hydromorphological alterations, water quality, and land use will allow water managers to better understand how large rivers have changed and to better define expectations for ecosystem conditions in the future.

TI Basic principles and ecological consequences of changing water regimes:
   Riparian plant communities
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Recent research has emphasized the importance of riparian ecosystems as centers of biodiversity and links between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Riparian ecosystems also belong among the environments that are most disturbed by humans and are in need of restoration to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity. To facilitate the completion of this task, researchers have an important function to communicate their knowledge to policy-makers and managers, This article presents some fundamental qualities of riparian systems, articulated as three basic principles. The basic principles proposed are: (1) The flow regime determines the successional evolution of riparian plant communities and ecological processes. (2) The riparian corridor serves as a pathway for redistribution of organic and inorganic material that influences plant communities along rivers. (3) The riparian system is a transition zone between land and water ecosystems and is disproportionately plant species-rich when compared to surrounding ecosystems. Translating these principles into management directives requires more information about how much water a river needs and when and how, i.e., flow variables described by magnitude, frequency, timing, duration, and rate of change. It also requires information about how various groups of organisms are affected by habitat fragmentation, especially in terms of their dispersal. Finally, it requires information about how effects of hydrologic alterations vary between different types of riparian systems and with the location within the watershed.

Recently, the method was implemented in The Netherlands. HEP is used to predict the ecological impact of measures and management activities concerning the ecological rehabilitation of rivers, tidal wetlands, lakes and marshes. For more than 30 fauna species the habitat requirements and preferences have been modelled. Examples of species-habitat relationships are presented. First results of the application of the method in ecological rehabilitation projects of rivers, lakes and marshes ace presented. The results show that the HEP approach is a useful tool in ecological water management.

TI THE IMPLICATIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CLIMATE CHANGE AND EUROPEAN
   WATER POLICY ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY THREATS
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS
AB The paper presents historical background, up-to-date situation and future perspectives for the development of nutrient pollution threats to European surface water quality, as well as the evolution of the approach to water pollution. Utilized agricultural area in European countries is slightly diminishing, however the consumption of mineral fertilisers is steadily increasing. The consumption in Europe in the years 2015-2030 is projected to increase by 10%, and in the world by 20%. Both climate changes leading to the increase of temperature even of ca. 6 degrees C (in comparison to the pre-industrial period) and accelerated soil erosion due to high intensity rainfall cause increased productivity of water ecosystems. Those aspects have to be taken into consideration in water management. Due to legal regulations introduced in the last twenty years, wastewater treatment has been made more effective and population connected to wastewater treatment systems has increased. The improvement has been seen mainly in eastern and southern parts of Europe. After the implementation of Water Framework Directive theories regarding modem water management have been developed, with the aim to increase the ecosystem's capacity and its resilience to climate changes and anthropopressure.

TI An integrated assessment framework for the analysis of multiple
   pressures in aquatic ecosystems and the appraisal of management options
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The contribution illustrates an integrated assessment framework aimed at evaluating the relationships between multiple pressures and water body status for the purposes of river basin management. The framework includes the following steps. (1) Understanding how the different pressures affect the status of water bodies. This entails the characterization of biophysical state variables and the definition of a causal relationship between pressures and status. Therefore this step involves interaction between experts bearing ecological understanding and experts providing models to represent the effect of pressures. (2) Identifying the relevant pressures to be addressed through appropriate measures to improve the status of water bodies. (3) Evaluating reduction targets for the relevant pressures identified in a river basin, by weighting the effort associated to reducing individual pressures and the potential benefits in terms of water body status. (4) Designing management measures through a creative process and political discussion of alternative options, balancing costs, benefits and effectiveness based on engineering and economic analysis. (5) Simulating scenarios of implementation of a programme of measures in order to check their effectiveness and robustness against climate and land use change. We discuss the five steps of the assessment framework, and particularly the interaction between science and policy at the different stages. We review the assessment tools required at each step and, for setting optimal pressure reduction targets (step 3), we propose and illustrate a simplified multicriteria approach based on semi-quantitative assessment, which produces frontiers of optimal trade-offs between effort spent on measures, and achievements.

AB A serious drop in ensuring the water quality in the distribution system is a factor that affects public health. This could lead to increase in biological and non-biological contents, change in colour and odour of the water. These contaminants cause a serious threat to the whole water ecosystem. The conventional methods of analyzing the water quality require much time and labour. So there is a need to monitor and protect the water with a real time water quality monitoring system in order to make active measurements to reduce contamination. The growth of the technology had helped in developing efficient methods to solve many serious issues in real-time. Internet of things (IoT) has achieved a great focus due to its faster processing and intelligence. This paper focuses on discussing the architecture, applications and need of IoT in water management system.

We show that water efficiency measures do not reduce economic pressures on water ecosystems. Consequently water price increases and reductions in water withdrawals are needed as ancillary measures. This water policy package opens a menu of possible outcomes in terms of conservation of water resources and the production of market goods. We also provide information about distributional impacts that should be considered to determine the convenience of implementing water saving programs.

TI Water Management for Conservation and Ecosystem Function: Modeling the
   Prioritization of Source Water in a Working Landscape
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Conservation in working landscapes is an important aspect of stream restoration. Landowners with agricultural water rights are increasingly adding instream flow as a beneficial use of their allocated water. However, stream restoration projects commonly focus on the quantity of water dedicated to the environment and overlook water quality. For cold-water ecosystems, the preservation of natural thermal regimes is a key to conservation efforts in the face of a changing climate. This study explored the effects of increasing stream flow using alternative water sources (e.g., instream runoff versus offchannel springs) to enhance cold-water stream habitat on a working cattle ranch. Using empirical data to create a steady-state stream flow and water temperature model, we evaluated temperature benefits and management trade-offs for ecological and agricultural water use. The modeled results showed that the source of water and the method used to deliver water to the channel affected the quality and extent of cold-water habitat. Offchannel spring water cooled 7-day average maximum temperatures and 7-day average mean temperatures by as much as 3.7? and 2.9?, respectively, but only when potential offchannel aquatic habitat was sacrificed for mainstem habitat. When offchannel, spring-fed habitat was provided, the value of spring water to the main channel decreased. Our findings suggest that source water thermal quality is of paramount importance for enhancing ecosystem function and improving cold-water habitat in working landscapes. In addition, the restoration of a historic spring channel may provide added ecosystem benefits by enhancing aquatic habitat for cold-water species.

TI The comparison of environmental flow assessment - The barrier for
   investment in Poland or river protection?
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Investments that make use of renewable resources of flowing waters must be based on the absolute necessity of protection of the water environment and that dependent on water. In practice, it means the obligation of leaving environmental flow in the river bed in the cross section below the place of water abstraction. The places of surface water abstraction for drinking and industrial purposes are thus limited with the volume of water obligatorily left in the flow for water organisms. In case of hydropower plants located directly in the watercourse, the environmental flow value corresponds approximately with the volume of water run in the fish pass obligatorily provided to maintain patency of the watercourse, in particular in the aspect of migration of diadromous fishes. Environmental flow is ineffective in investment terms, but highly important from the point of view of environmental protection. Thus, the proper calculation of the environmental flow value should be the compromise between the protection of the environment and the economics of the investment. No unanimous methodology in this respect has been applied in Poland for many years, and calculations were done with one of subjectively selected methods functioning in the literature. This work presents the methodology of environmental flow calculations broken down into water regions. Calculation path has been presented along with the possible inconveniences resulting from the effective legal regulations in Poland as regards the possibilities of carrying out projects that take advantage of flowing surface waters.

TI Biological contact oxidation and an artificial floating island for black
   odorous river purification
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB Due to destruction caused by urbanization and anthropogenic activities, various methods for treating black odorous rivers have been proposed. Herein, a treatment scheme was put forward for a black odorous river in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. The river was treated using composite artificial floating island and improved biological contact oxidation processes as the core, supplemented by source control, substrate purification, and water ecosystem construction. The transparency, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) of the water body met the China Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard (GB3838-2002) V. The oxidation-reduction potential was remarkably improved and the black odor phenomenon was eliminated. The composite artificial floating island had the highest TP removal rate of 38.30%, while the improved biological contact oxidation process had the highest NH3-N removal rate of 43.08%. The process is effective in improving the quality of black odorous rivers and has high applicability; thus, the process provides a reference for the treatment of other black odorous water bodies.

TI Effects of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on the photodissolution
   of particulate organic matter: Insights from fluorescence spectroscopy
   and environmental implications
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Widely used titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are likely to accumulate ultimately in sediments and potentially pose a risk to water ecosystems. This study evaluated the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the photodissolution of particulate organic matter (POM) through fluorescence spectroscopy. Excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analyses revealed that the fluorescent characteristics of produced dissolved organic matter (DOM) during photodissolution of suspended sediment and synthetic particulate organic matter (SPOM) were primarily humic-like. SPOM particles appeared to simulate well the photodissolution of suspended sediment. Quasi-complete increases in fluorescence intensity and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) abundance were reached after 90, 60, and 50 min irradiation for TiO2 concentrations of 0, 2, and 5 mg respectively. The faster increment of fluorescence intensity and CDOM abundance indicated the photocatalytic dissolution of SPOM, as opposite charges between TiO2 and SPOM at pH = 4 favored the adsorption of TiO2 onto SPOM. For sediments, the CDOM abundance and fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing TiO2 concentration, resulting from the photocatalytic degradation of photoproduced DOM from sediments. These results demonstrated that pH plays an important role in the photocatalytic dissolution of POM by TiO2. Therefore, appropriate pH controls should be implemented when TiO2 are used to treat sediments contaminated with organic pollutants. Finally, with increasing use of TiO2, its accumulation in sediments may affect the fate of carbon, nutrients, and heavy metals in shallow-water ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physical habitat for this species is compared for river reaches with different flow modification histories to understand local extinctions across this species' historical range. Time-series of physical habitat, generated using PHABSIM. indicate a dramatic reduction in habitat area with flow modification.

TI METHODS FOR CLASSIFYING THE OPTICAL STATES OF WATER ECOSYSTEMS
SO SOVIET JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB Sample covariance matrices (SCM) for spectrometric data are used as classification objects and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the SCM are used as classification features. The position of the plane of the principal components in n-dimensional space is largely determined by the composition of the water medium. Thus, the distance between the planes of the principal components of SCM from two sets of measurements may be used as a measure of the similarity or difference between the optical states. Estimates of statistically indistinguishable (equivalent) optical states are obtained for a standard probabilistic data model with an arbitrary number of variables. It is shown that it is possible to derive a more accurate classification model by taking numerical differences in the content of optically active substances in the target objects into account.

TI Suitability of drinking water quality in Chittagong Metropolitan City,
   Bangladesh: a research on urban water bodies (UWBs) using multivariate
   analytic techniques
SO H2OPEN JOURNAL
AB This is empirical research that focuses on the urban water ecosystems in the humid tropics of South Asia. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the quality of drinking water in the urban water bodies (UWBs) of Chittagong Metropolitan City (CMC), Bangladesh. The field data was centered on the analysis and depiction of twenty-three (23) water quality parameters, collected from twenty-one (21) spatial observation units. Analytic tools include suitability analysis, correlation matrix, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis (CA) as a means to an end. The data were analyzed using SPSS. The analysis reveals that drinking water quality in studied UWBs was inappropriate during the monsoon season. Parameters that crossed the extreme permissible concentration incorporate EC, BOD, COD, Turbidity, Nitrate, Total coliform, and Fecal coliform. The PCA extracted four factors (PC1-4) with an eigenvalue of 10.23, explaining 73.1% of the total variation in the dataset in cumulative terms. The CA recognized three (3) broad groups of the sampling stations. Group A represents nine cases, suffering the most from pollution concentration in CMC. Awareness building at all levels is advocated to improve clean water sources, increase service provision, and ensure public health safeguards.

AB The increasing population and water pollution in DKI Jakarta by domestic waste causes raw water supply unfulfilled. The problem can be solved by utilizing one of the existing surface water in DKI Jakarta that is East Flood Canal (BKT). This research aims to analyze the quality, quantity, and continuity of East Canal Flood as water source for DKI Jakarta. The method used for water quality test is based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI) with raw water key parameters according to water class I and II Government Regulation No. 82 of 2001. BKT water quantity and continuity calculate based on the dependable flow capacity with a probability of 80% (Q80) accumulation the Cipinang River and diverted Ciliwung River. The results showed seven parameters exceeded the water quality standard class I and II Government Regulation No. 82 of 2001, ie BOD, COD, phosphate, nitrite, ammonia, total coliform, and faecal coli. The quantity and continuity of water in upstream BKT are available at minimum 1.49 m(3)/sec and the maximum 4.69 m(3)/sec when Cipinang River critical condition in August-September and the water volume in the Ciliwung River is excessive. To conclude, there is potency of BKT as ecosystem services provide drinking water for DKI Jakarta.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The main focus of this study was to assess radiation exposure to human and non-human biota due to natural radionuclides in soil of the Serbian capital. For the first time, ERICA tool was employed for calculation of gamma dose rates to non-human biota in this area. In analyzed soils, the mean values of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 specific activities were found to be 35, 43 and 490 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The distribution of analyzed natural radionuclides in soils was discussed in respect to its statistically significant correlations with sand, silt, clay, carbonates, cation exchange capacity and pH value. The annual outdoor effective dose rates to the population varied from 48 to 98 mu Sv, and the total dose rates to terrestrial biota, calculated by ERICA tool, varied from 9.84 x 10(-2) mu Gy h(-1) (for tree) to 5.54 x 10(+0) mu Gy h(-1) (for lichen and bryophytes). The results obtained could serve as a baseline data for the assessment of possible anthropogenic enhancement of the total dose rate to human and non-human biota of the study area.

TI IMPACT OF THE SALINITY GRADIENT ON THE MOLLUSC FAUNA IN FLOODED MINE
   SUBSIDENCES (KARVINA, CZECH REPUBLIC)
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB This paper presents the impact of salinisation on the aquatic mollusc fauna in flooded mine subsidences in the Karvina region (Czech Republic). The results of the previous research on salinity in flooded mine subsidences show that some of them contain a high content of dissolved inorganic substances (above 1000 mg.l(-1)). These substances can affect the vegetation and animals occurring in the water and the surrounding area. The phylum of Mollusca was selected as a model group for the fieldwork as it includes species with the proven bioindication potential.
   The occurrence of aquatic mollusc species was studied at 10 sites. The sites were selected based on the content of dissolved substances (the salinity gradient from <500 to >1000 mg.l(-1). A total of 12 aquatic mollusc species were found, including one species identified as a potential bioindicator of the negative effect of salinisation on aquatic biota.
   The analysis showed statistically significant positive correlations between the content of dissolved inorganic substances and the presence of alien species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (J.E. Gray, 1843). The gradient of salinity significantly affects the species composition of the mollusc fauna in flooded mine subsidences and may affect the biodiversity of this group.

TI Fossil evidence in Australia for oldest known freshwater crayfish of
   Gondwana
SO GONDWANA RESEARCH
AB Early Cretaceous body and trace fossils in Victoria, Australia, establish the oldest known presence of parastacid crayfish (Decapoda: Astacidea, Parastacoidea) in freshwater environments of Australia, and the oldest known crayfish in Gondwana. Parastacid body fossils, comprised of a partial abdomen (Palaeoechinastacus australianus, gen. et sp. nov.) and two chelae, are from a fluvial deposit in the Otway Group (Albian). Trace fossils in fluvial deposits of the Otway Group and Strzelecki Group (Aptian) also closely resemble modem parastacid burrow systems, supplying independent verification of crayfish presence and their burrowing habits in Australia at this time. Paleoenvironments in this region were high-latitude and periglacial, indicating that these crayfish were adapted to cold-water ecosystems. The combined fossil evidence provides a starting point for the previously unknown paleoccology and evolutionary history of Mesozoic parastacids in Australia, while supporting phylogenies that suggest parastacid radiation from southeastern Australia before the complete breakup of Gondwana.

TI Intertidal invertebrates locally enhance primary production
SO ECOLOGY
AB The contribution of autochthonous vs. allochthonous inputs to productivity is an important determinant of ecosystem function across multiple habitats. In coastal marine systems, nutrients are thought to come primarily from the upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich water. Using experimental manipulations of a dominant tide pool animal, the mussel Mytilus californianus, I show that the presence of mussels greatly increases the supply of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Mussels further had a direct effect on productivity: benthic microalgal abundance increased by a factor of 4 8, while the growth of a red alga was four times greater in the presence of mussels. The increase in nitrite and nitrate associated with mussels further suggests nitrifying activity by microbes. These findings have broad implications for coastal marine systems, including that regenerated nutrients may contribute more to productivity than previously recognized and that the presence of animal-generated nutrients sets the stage for numerous positive interactions.

SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB A coupled circulation and water ecosystem model is presented. The description of the hydrodynamic model is given in the previous paper (Tamsalu & Myrberg, Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science 41, 249-273). The calculations in the FINEST model are carried out in two phases. In the first step the two-layer, two-dimensional hydrodynamic parameters (current velocity, temperature, salinity, density, sea-level fluctuation and turbulent fluxes) are calculated. After that the results of the hydrodynamic model are used as the input data for the aquatic ecosystem characteristics calculation. In the FINEST model the conception of a size-structured plankton food-web is used. The biochemical reactions in the plankton community (growth rate, metabolism, etc.) are described depending on organism size. The FINEST model was used for simulations of seasonal and long-term variations in the Gulf of Finland ecosystem. For seasonal calculations the finite-difference method was applied and for long-term calculations the box method was applied. (C) Academic Press Limited.

TI The Role of Fisheries in Optimal Eutrophication Management
SO WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB We analyze dynamically optimal eutrophication management using two controls, targeted fishing and reduction of external nutrient loads. Fishing removes nutrients from the water ecosystem, and the size of the fish stock also influences eutrophication through food web effects and other mechanisms. We show that fisheries have a role to play in cost-efficient water quality management in combination with external load reductions. Our numerical application considers phosphorus driven eutrophication, agricultural phosphorus abatement and fisheries targeted on cyprinids on a coastal bay in the Baltic Sea. The socially and privately optimal intensity of fishing efforts, phosphorus abatement and the resulting water quality are influenced by damages, revenues and costs. Furthermore, we show that the link between cyprinid fish stock and water quality, and the form of the fishing industry - sole owner or open access - have joint dynamics that lead to very different outcomes. A weak link between cyprinid stock and water quality is associated with socially optimal stock close to its maximum sustainable yield. This maximizes phosphorus removal. With a strong link, socially optimal stock and phosphorus removal are low. Coincidentally, open-access fishing sometimes yields socially desirable outcome automatically - a market failure in industry structure may counteract eutrophication.

TI Results of laboratory and field experiments of the direct effect of
   increasing CO2 on net primary production of macroalgal species in
   brackish-water ecosystems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ESTONIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB Studies on the effects of increasing acidification on marine communities have been previously mostly carried out in truly marine areas whereas brackish-water ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea have been less studied. The current study analyses how acidification induced by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide affects the photosynthetic net production of different macroalgal species in the brackish Baltic Sea. Research methods include sets of laboratory and field experiments carried out in shallow coastal brackish waters. The aim of the laboratory experiments was to develop the necessary techniques and experience for the mesocosm experiments. Laboratory experiments were carried out using specimens of the red alga Furcellaria lumbricalis collected from Kakumae Bay. The mesocosm experiments were conducted in Koiguste Bay during the field season of 2011. Separate mesocosms were operated in each set with different CO2 concentrations and a control treatment in natural conditions. Field experiments were carried out with three species representing three different morphological and ecological groups: Ulva intestinalis, a fast-growing green alga; Fucus vesiculosus, a perennial brown alga with a slow metabolism; and Furcellaria lumbricalis, a perennial red alga. Photosynthetic activity was used as the response variable. In the laboratory decreasing pH increased the net primary production of F. lumbricalis with the lowest net primary production values measured at pH 8.0 and the highest at pH 6.5. Results of the field experiments indicated that increased CO2 levels in seawater favoured photosynthetic activity of the macroalgae U. intestinalis and F. lumbricalis, but F. vesiculosus showed no response to elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 levels are suggested to favour the production of fast-growing filamentous species, which thus may indirectly enhance the effect of eutrophication in the shallow coastal brackish waters.

Surrounded by urban patterns, urban scenic fringe areas are playing an important role in coordinating the relationship between city development and scenic resources protection and utilization. To support co-evolutionary development and positive interactions between urban land and urban scenic area in water town, landscape approaches for managing fringe areas within their broader water ecosystem and urban context have been put forward, by considering the interrelationships of their physical forms, natural features, and urban ecosystem restoration. An actual project of Slender West Lake, a famous urban scenic area in Yangzhou, China, has been proposed as an evidence of the strategies.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB We aimed to define the taxonomic status of 40 haemolytic and/or proteolytic strains of the genus Acinetobacter which were previously classified into five putative species termed as genomic species 14BJ (n=9), genomic species 17 (n=9), taxon 18 (n=7), taxon 19 (n=6) and taxon 20 (n=9). The strains were recovered mostly from human clinical specimens or soil and water ecosystems and were highly diverse in geographical origin and time of isolation. Comparative analysis of the rpoB and gyrB gene sequences of all strains, and the whole-genome sequences of selected strains, showed that these putative species formed five respective, well-supported clusters within a distinct clade of the genus Acinetobacter which typically, although not exclusively, encompasses strains with strong haemolytic activity. The whole-genome-based average nucleotide identity (ANIb) values supported the species status of each of these clusters. Moreover, the distinctness and coherence of the clusters were supported by whole-cell profiling based on MALDI-TOF MS. Congruent with these findings were the results of metabolic and physiological testing. We conclude that the five putative taxa represent respective novel species, for which the names Acinetobacter courvalinii sp. nov.

AB As a better understanding of Beijing surface water ecosystems can provide clues for environmental management and public health, here, we report a study of the bacterial communities of five Beijing surface waters conducted using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. We expected to observe a core bacterial community among the surface waters and differences in bacterial community abundance over the different locations of sampling. In this study, we obtained a total of 60,810 trimmed reads from the five samples after the removal of unqualified reads. Bacterial sequences from the five samples were classified into taxonomic classes using the default settings of the mothur platform. Our results provided insight into the bacterial community composition of surface waters and revealed that there was a core microbial community in the microbial populations of surface samples at different geographic locations, with 13 phyla and 40 genera in common. Our findings also revealed the differences in bacterial communities among five surface water samples obtained at different locations.

TI The importance of estuarine-derived carbon for the nearshore marine
   environment: studies on two contrasting South African estuaries
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
AB The food web structure within and adjacent to two permanently open estuaries with contrasting flow regimes along the south-eastern coast of South Africa was investigated employing stable isotope analysis. The Kariega Estuary is considered a freshwater-deprived system, while the Great Fish Estuary is freshwater-dominated due to an interbasin transfer scheme. Results from a study undertaken in April 2005 indicate that in the Kariega Estuary carbon sources assimilated by the zooplankton are derived from riparian vegetation in the upper reaches and from salt marsh and submerged macrophytes in the lower reaches of the system. In contrast, within the freshwater-dominated Great Fish Estuary the zooplankton appear to be sustained largely by allochthonous phytoplankton derived from freshwater inflow due to the interbasin transfer scheme. The magnitude of outflow of fresh water appears to play an important role as a carbon source for copepods and filter feeders in the marine environment adjacent to the Great Fish Estuary. The export of estuarine-derived particulate organic matter (POM) was evident up to 12 km downstream (west) of the Great Fish Estuary. Conversely, estuarine-derived POM appears to be utilised only directly adjacent to the Kariega Estuary mouth.

TI Marine protected areas for deepwater fish populations: an evaluation of
   their effects in Hawai'i
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
AB The success of marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool for conservation and fisheries management has been well documented. However, these results have typically been seen in shallow water systems and questions remain whether this management strategy could be successfully applied to deepwater ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine the efficacy of four deepwater MPAs called bottomfish restricted fishing areas (BRFAs), with various time spans of protection, monitored at depths between 90 and 310 m from 2007 to 2011 for six species of deepwater snapper and one grouper harvested in the Main Hawaiian Islands. Our results suggested that the duration of protection influenced reserve effects, particularly for target species. Mean fish length, and in some cases abundance, increased for one or more of the most economically important target species inside nearly all tested BRFAs. In addition, more mature fish were seen inside the BRFA with the longest duration of protection (similar to 14 years); species richness increased outside this area while inside it remained the same. Here, we provide the first evidence that deepwater MPAs can have positive effects on deepwater species and that many protection effects were consistent with results found in shallow water ecosystems. While these findings are novel, additional data over greater temporal scales will be necessary to determine whether these trends will continue and if others will become important over time.

TI Diet of Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) from subtropical coastal
   lakes: Evidence from stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses
SO LIMNOLOGICA
AB Freshwater gastropods, through their indiscriminate deposit feeding, provide an essential link between available benthic resources and higher trophic levels in a variety of aquatic habitats. Here we focus on the contribution of available sources to the diet of Melanoides tuberculata in different habitats within coastal subtropical lakes. Globally, this species is one of two dominant alien invasive thiarid gastropods that have established populations in diverse habitats across the New World. We assessed the dietary composition of M. tuberculata to provide insight on the ability of this species to utilize a range of resources under different environmental conditions as a factor that contributes towards its invasion success. Our results show that M. tuberculata exhibits a degree of trophic plasticity and that its diet is largely determined by the availability of resources. However, all sources were not consumed in equal proportions. Benthic microalgae and filamentous Cladophora sp. dominated the diet of snails inhabiting the shallow stream fed habitats, with sedimentary organic matter making a significantly lower contribution. In contrast, detritus was the most important food source for individuals from the littoral zone of an oligotrophic lake. Although M. tuberculata exhibits trophic plasticity, there is evidence for specialization in diet between individuals within small spatial scales. These variations may contribute to the overall invasion success of this species, by reducing intraspecific competition for resources following introduction to new habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI Designing an in situ remediation strategy for polluted surface water
   bodies through the specific regulation of microbial community
SO FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB This paper proposes an in situ restoration strategy, ecosystem activation system (EAS), for selfpurification abilities of polluted water ecosystems through the specific regulation of microbial community. EAS utilizes polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) to modify indigenous microbial communities of polluted water bodies. Microorganisms preferentially utilizing PHA as the carbon source for their enhanced growth are defined as specific, and those with no special selectivity to PHA and raw-water dissolved organic matter are defined as non-specific and can be phased out during EAS operation. As a result, the microbial community can be regulated to the specific structure, which is beneficial for the water quality improvement. The developed model described the above principle with accounting for the growth kinetics of specific microorganisms, competitive inhabitation of specific microorganisms on non-specific microorganisms, and coupled EAS-induced self-purification of polluted water bodies. The conceptual model is believed to be a primary step toward quantitative design, operation, and optimization of EAS.

TI The complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinese Daphnia pulex
   (Cladocera, Daphniidae)
SO ZOOKEYS
AB Daphnia pulex has played an important role in fresh-water ecosystems. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of Daphnia pulex from Chaohu, China was sequenced for the first time. It was accomplished using long-PCR methods and a primer-walking sequencing strategy with genus-specific primers. The mitogenome was found to be 15,306 bp in length. It contained 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a typical control region. This research revealed an overall A+T content of 64.50%. All of the 22 typical animal tRNA genes had a classical clover-leaf structure except for trnS1, in which its DHU arm simply formed a loop. The lengths of small and large rRNA were 744 bp and 1,313 bp, respectively. The A+T-rich region was 723 bp in length, which is longer than that from the North American species (689 bp). In terms of structure and composition, many similarities were found between the Chinese and North American Daphnia pulex.

   heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting invertebrates and water ecosystems of
   the Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan
SO MICROBIOLOGY
AB The annual changes in bacterial numbers and diversity of the heterotrophic microflora in invertebrates and ambient water were studied. During the whole period of observation, bacterial cell numbers were higher in invertebrate specimens than in the ambient water. The highest number of bacterial cells was detected in trepangs and sea urchins, while the lowest number of cells was detected in starfish. Based on the results of phenotypic analysis and analysis of fatty acid composition of bacterial cell lipids, 487 strains (out of the total of 502 isolates) of heterotrophic bacteria were identified to the genus level. Morphological differences between the winter and summer isolates of vibrios and halomonads were analyzed. The seasonal dynamics of the cell numbers of vibrios and halomonads was revealed. The gram-positive microflora was most often present in animals during the winter, fall, and spring periods. The diversity of heterotrophic bacteria was greater in the water column than in animal tissues.

TI Chlorotriazine Reactive Azo Red 120 textile dye induces micronuclei in
   fish
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB The main objective of this work was to use micronucleus induction in fish erythrocytes to study the risk to aquatic ecosystems due to the genotoxicity of Chlorotriazine Reactive Azo Red 120 textile dye. The frequencies of micronuclei were studied for three low doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/L and blood sampling was carried out on the same fish after 3, 6, and 9 days. It was found that micronuclei increased not only in a dose-dependent manner but also in a time-dependent may, compared with negative (tap water) and positive (10 ppm benzene) control groups. There was also a slight, time-dependent increase in erythrocyte micronuclei of the control fish specimens. This study proved the genotoxicity of this dye, and suggests that further studies should be made on other dyes and some other toxic industrial pollutant discharges in water ecosystems, using fish as an indicator to monitor pollutant genotoxicity.

TI Ecosystem services provision, tourism and climate variability in shallow
   lakes: The case of La Salada, Buenos Aires, Argentina
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB Water ecosystem services have been widely explored within the context of climate change studies, becoming a key piece in addressing local water challenges and designing possible strategies for diminishing climate risks. This paper explores how ecosystem services provision in La Salada shallow lake, Argentina, including maintenance of the landscape for touristic and recreational activities, have been affected by changes in climate conditions according to the local stakeholders perception. After mapping and prioritizing ecosystem services using participatory research activities, it analyzes how this provision has evolved in response to the different precipitation scenarios already observed in the area. The results for the case of La Salada shallow lake indicate that there is not a clear relationship between precipitations and the key ecosystem services provided by the lake and their surrounding ecosystem, mainly due to the anthropogenic lake management, and that tourism does not seem to directly depend on climate conditions.

TI Nano-TiO2 aggravates immunotoxic effects of chronic ammonia stress in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) intestine
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB Ammonia and nano-TiO2 are commonly found pollutants in aquatic environments around the world. NH3 has been proved to be absorbed on nano-TiO2 surface, therefore, the biosafety and environmental effects of ammonia and co-occurring nano-TiO2 in aquatic environments has increased considerably in recent years. To explore the potential interactive effects and mechanisms of ammonia and nano-TiO2 on the intestinal immune system, three-month-old female zebrafish were exposed to total ammonia nitrogen (TAN; 0, 3, 30 mg/L) with or without nano-TiO2 (1 mg/L) for 60 d. The results showed that intestinal ammonia levels increased with the increase of TAN exposure concentration in the presence of nano-TiO2. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that both TAN and nano-TiO2 caused cell vacuolation, lymphocyte infiltration and goblet cells hyperplasia in the intestine mucosa. Our study also found that the contents and gene expression levels of lysozyme (lys) and beta-defensin (def-beta) in the intestine of zebrafish exposed to TAN alone or combined with nano-TiO2 were significantly reduced, suggesting a decline in the intestinal innate immunity of fish. A broad upregulation of TLRs-related genes indicated that TAN and nano-TiO2 could activate TLR4/5-mediated MyD88-dependent pathway, and eventually induce intestinal inflammation. It should be noted that TAN combined with nano-TiO2 had more significant inhibitory effects on the intestinal structure and innate immune responses than TAN alone. Current data sug-gested that ammonia and nano-TiO2 had a synergistic inhibitory effect on intestinal mucosal immunity, and their associated health risk to aquatic animals and the water ecosystem should not be underestimated.

TI Habitat Complexity Alters Predator-Prey Interactions in a Shallow Water
   Ecosystem
SO DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB Habitat complexity can profoundly influence interactions between predators and their prey due to changes to foraging efficiencies. In aquatic systems, habitat alterations can alter pursuit times and swimming behaviours of predator-prey participants, which in turn could mediate the strength of their interactions and, thus, population dynamics. The lower reaches of estuarine ecosystems are typically characterised by extensive beds of submerged macrophytes that might influence the trophic dynamics between pelagic predators and their prey. Here, we investigate the influence of increasing habitat complexity on the consumption of the calanoid copepod, Paracartia longipatella, by adult male and female mysid, Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, by means of a comparative functional response approach. Using structures that resembled aquatic vegetation, we quantified and compared feeding rates, attack rates, and handling times across the habitat gradient, and we questioned whether responses to habitat complexity are different between sexes. Feeding rates related significantly negatively to increasing habitat complexity for both males and females, with Type II functional responses consistently displayed. Functional response differed significantly across habitat complexities, with feeding rates at low and intermediate prey densities significantly greater in the absence of habitat compared to more complex structures for both predator sexes. Results of the current study demonstrate that increased habitat complexity mediates outcomes of interactions between M. wooldridgei and the calanoid copepod, P. longipatella across predator sexes, and possibly for other predators and prey in shallow waters. Owing to spatiotemporal differences in habitat structure within shallow waters, the strength of interactions in this predator-prey system likely differs in areas where they co-exist.

TI Thermal effluents from power plants boost performance of the invasive
   clam Corbicula fluminea in Ireland's largest river
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Elevated temperatures due to anthropogenic activities can improve the performance of non-native species that are adapted to higher temperatures than resident species. Ecosystems may experience higher temperature due to global stressors, such as climate change, or local stressors, including thermal effluents and urban heat islands. Using field surveys of population density and body size of the highly invasive and hot-adapted clam Corbicula fluminea in and out of two thermal effluents from power plants along the River Shannon, Ireland, we tested the hypothesis that C. fluminea performs better in thermal plumes. Shell length and body mass of C. fluminea in thermal effluents were 1.8 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, compared with adjacent unheated river sections. Density of C. fluminea was 13.7 times higher in heated, compared with unheated river reaches, leading to an increase in combined biomass per unit area of >50-fold. Our temperature data suggest an up to 2.5-fold increase of degree-days for growth and up to 5.2-fold increase of degree-days for larval incubation in the thermal plumes in River Shannon, compared with unheated conditions. Through enlarged body size, the elevated temperatures likely increase fecundity within the plumes.These findings illustrate that, in temperate climates, thermal plumes can form sanctuaries, where C. fluminea likely alters habitat, outpaces competitors and potentially dominates the energy flow through food webs. Furthermore, thermal plumes can act as stepping-stones and propagule banks for further proliferation of C. fluminea and other warm-adapted invaders. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Role of habitats and sampling techniques on macroinvertebrate
   descriptors and ecological indicators: An experiment in a protected
   Mediterranean lagoon
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Macroinvertebrates are commonly applied for ecological investigations and as ecological indicators. However, the role of the sampling technique, effort and habitat on macroinvertebrate descriptors, diversity indices and ecological indicators in transitional water ecosystems is little known yet. This research aims to evaluate the influence of sampling techniques on macroinvertebrate assemblages and ecological indicators comparing box corer and litterbag techniques, in prairie and unvegetated habitats. The experiment was conducted in a protected Mediterranean shallow lagoon dominated by marine water input. Three types of litterbags were prepared with: i. Phragmites australis dry leaves (terrestrial input); ii. Posidonia oceanica dry leaves (marine input), and iii. an equal mixture of both leaves. Three replicates of box-corer samples were collected in two sites per habitat, litterbags were submerged and retrieved after 30 days. Macroinvertebrate abundance, species richness, diversity indices and ecological indicators were measured and compared among sampling techniques and between habitats. Macroinvertebrate data was then pooled, analysed and compared to each single technique. Twenty-seven species were sampled overall, 4 species overlapped between box-corer and litterbags, 6 species (26%) were exclusive to the box-corer and 16 species (59%) were caught using only litterbags. Species diversity in litterbags was always higher than in box-corer, but macroinvertebrate assemblages were described better when using data pooled. In prairie, the ecological indicators varied significantly between the data pooled and separate sampling technique. Finally, this research highlights the relevance of using more than one sampling technique to obtain a better description of macroinvertebrate assemblages and the ecological status of Mediterranean lagoons.

TI Benthic and planktonic primary production along a nutrient gradient in
   Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA
SO FRESHWATER SCIENCE
AB Primary production in lakes occurs in both planktonic (water column) and benthic (bottom) habitats. How whole-lake primary production is distributed between these 2 habitats-referred to as autotrophic structure-is a key ecosystem property. Empirical research examining the balance between benthic and planktonic primary production in lakes is scarce, and how autotrophic structure changes across depth, nutrient, water clarity, and biological invasion gradients is unclear. Therefore, we are ill equipped to anticipate ecosystem-level responses to environmental change. We assessed the magnitude of offshore planktonic, nearshore planktonic, and nearshore benthic gross primary production (GPP) along a gradient of nutrients, water clarity, and Cladophora biomass in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA, during summer 2010, 2011, and 2012. Benthic and planktonic GPP varied strongly along the trophic gradient. Planktonic GPP increased with nutrients status, whereas benthic GPP decreased. From shore to 10 m depth, autotrophic structure shifted from planktonic dominance near the mouth of the Fox River (95% planktonic) to a mix of benthic and planktonic GPP 35 km from the mouth of the Fox (similar to 40% benthic). The steep bathymetry at more-distant sites reduced the relative importance of benthic GPP at the whole-ecosystem level. Our work highlights the dual-pathway (i.e., benthic and planktonic) nature of lentic food webs from the perspective of GPP, and shows how both trophic status and bathymetry affect autotrophic structure.

TI Molecular identification of two species of the carnivorous sea slug
   Philine, invaders of the US west coast
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Open-coast and deep-water ecosystems have been less disrupted by invasion than estuaries, but a notable exception is the establishment of multiple species of the sea slug genus Philine in the northeastern Pacific. These large slugs spread from San Francisco Bay to the whole of the US west coast in 5 years during the 1990s, and are abundant from intertidal mudflats to soft-sediment bottoms > 300 m deep along the open coast. Voracious predators that secrete acid, Philine spp. have few natural enemies and substantial impacts on native bivalve communities. Despite their ecological significance, the identity and number of invasive Philine spp. in the US has remained controversial. Here, we adopt a molecular approach to identify the species commonly found along the US west coast. We compared mitochondrial 16S gene sequences of reference specimens from the native range of seven possible invaders against sequences of 66 specimens collected from southern California to Oregon from intertidal and subtidal habitats. All slugs from southern California and Oregon were confirmed as P. auriformis, and most shared haplotypes with samples from New Zealand. Larger slugs from San Francisco, Tomales Bay and Bodega Harbor, believed to represent 3-4 species, were all identified as P. orientalis. Molecular data support a recent morphological analysis that erected two proposed species, P. paucipapillata from Hong Kong and P. quadripartita from Europe, which are genetically distinct from anatomically similar species. For taxonomically challenging groups like sea slugs, genetic data can illuminate cryptic invasions and provide a backdrop for further studies of the ecological impacts of introduced marine species.

TI Life strategies of Halobatrachus didactylus (Bloch and Schneider, 1801)
   in the Tagus estuary: Comparison among different morphotypes
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB The Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), is a subtropical sound-producing marine teleost that inhabits estuaries and other brackish water ecosystems in its northern distribution area. The relative isolation of populations within estuaries may cause important modifications in the bio-ecology of this species. The males of this species present two morphotypes which are more accurately distinguishable during the reproductive season. In the Tagus estuary population, the two types of reproductive males were present: type I, the "characteristic" morphotype, and type II, the alternative morphotype. The opportunistic males had more developed testis while type I males had more developed accessory glands. Type I males presented more developed swimbladders and larger body size and live longer than type II males. On the contrary, type II males grew faster and matured earlier. The feeding habits of the two male morphotypes were similar during the reproductive season but differences were found between reproductive specimens and non-reproductive specimens. The diet of reproductive specimens was mainly composed of benthic prey in contrast to predominance of nectobenthic prey in the diet of non-reproductive specimens. The females of H. didactylus generally had an intermediate pattern between the two male morphotypes. The percentage of type II males tended to be higher in denser areas of the estuary. In comparison with populations from different size ecosystems, smaller ecosystems revealed important modifications on the bio-ecology of the species due to the increased competition for nesting sites and mating partners, favouring alternative male tactics.

TI The distribution and turnover of benthic organic matter in a lowland
   river: Influence of hydrology, seston load and impoundment
SO RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB The standing stocks of benthic organic matter (BOM) and some of its biochemical compounds (particulate organic carbon, particulate nitrogen, protein, and chlorophyll a) were investigated in the upper 12 cm of the sediments at several sampling sites in a free-flowing and in an impounded river section of the lowland River Spree (Germany). Several environmental variables were recorded, in order to determine their potential influence on the organic matter content in the sediments. It was shown that the organic matter content in the upper sediment layers was mainly determined by the local hydrological regime, which was best reflected by the particle size distribution at the sampling sites. For the deepest investigated sediment strata, no influencing factors could be determined. The amount and quality of suspended matter was of minor importance to sediment composition. Also seasonal effects could not be detected.
   The impounded river section exhibited less seasonal variation in organic matter storage, as well as shorter carbon turnover lengths, longer carbon turnover times and lower rates of annual organic matter recycling than the free-flowing river section, which indicates that changes in river hydraulics result in alterations to the organic matter budget. These alterations could be related to the changed mesohabitat composition and to the higher standing stocks of organic matter in the impounded river reach. We conclude that both morphological and hydrological alterations affect the structure and function of running water ecosystems because of their negative effect on the organic matter cycling.

TI Effect of Physical Characteristics and Hydrodynamic Conditions on
   Transport and Deposition of Microplastics in Riverine Ecosystem
SO WATER
AB Microplastic disposal into riverine ecosystems is an emergent ecological hazard that mainly originated from land-based sources. This paper presents a comprehensive review on physical processes involved in microplastics transport in riverine ecosystems. Microplastic transport is governed by physical characteristics (e.g., plastic particle density, shape, and size) and hydrodynamics (e.g., laminar and turbulent flow conditions). High-density microplastics are likely to prevail near riverbeds, whereas low-density particles float over river surfaces. Microplastic transport occurs either due to gravity-driven (vertical transport) or settling (horizontal transport) in river ecosystems. Microplastics are subjected to various natural phenomena such as suspension, deposition, detachment, resuspension, and translocation during transport processes. Limited information is available on settling and rising velocities for various polymeric plastic particles. Therefore, this paper highlights how appropriately empirical transport models explain vertical and horizontal distribution of microplastic in riverine ecosystems. Microplastics interact, and thus feedback loops within the environment govern their fate, particularly as these ecosystems are under increasing biodiversity loss and climate change threat. This review provides outlines for fate and transport of microplastics in riverine ecosystems, which will help scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders in better monitoring and mitigating microplastics pollution.

TI Trophic-based diversification in benthivorous charrs (Salvelinus)
   dwelling littoral zones of Northern lakes
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Charrs of the genus Salvelinus form distinct trophic morphs living in sympatry in numerous postglacial lakes. Here we demonstrate that charrs can diversify into amphipod foraging specialists and sedentary macrobenthos consumers in the shallow-water ecosystems. This pattern was revealed in three out of six lakes under exploration supported by differences in stomach content, trophic-transmitted parasite, and stable isotope ratio analyzes. The body shape and growth rate comparison indicates that this kind of trophic-based diversification emerges at a juvenile stage and is maintained throughout the whole life. The restriction in gene flow found between the morphs allows to propose the possibility for the hereditable-based specialization to evolve. We found that those diversification phenomena are possible only in the lakes situated in vicinity of the ocean coastline, while no evidence of this split was found for inland mountain lakes. We suggest that the trophic-based diversification in the littoral ecosystems is accounted for the heterogeneity in the ecological conditions and food resources' distribution linked to coastal wind action. This phenomenon was previously reported for the charr in Lake Fjellfrosvatn, Scandinavia, so it seems to be some universal yet poorly described kind of disruptive selection pressure for northern latitude fishes.

AB Issues of sustainable development are widely discussed in the scientific press. and their consideration is relevant. The purpose of the research is to study and analyze common problems of major cities in the world, to develop approaches to their solution. The research methodology's peculiarity is the factor analysis of data in a long-term period for some large cities and urban agglomerations. It has been found that the problems of most large cities and urban agglomerations in industrialized countries are associated with the rapid ageing of their infrastructure (energy, transport, utilities, waste disposal). These problems are quite general and comparable and confirmed by actual data. The article shows that cities can be considered as large and complex socio-technological systems consisting of two subsystems or levels. The material and physical subsystem is configured by the built urban environment and physical infrastructure. The social subsystem is configured by human activity and social interactions of people in the city. The problems of the material and physical subsystem can be solved with innovative technologies (digitalization, the intellectualization of cities) and significant investments. The problems of the social subsystem of cities are determined by their historical development, social structure, and demographics and require separate approaches for specific cities. A conceptual model of climate and other external factors on the city's water ecosystem is proposed. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

TI Photo-Oxidative Degradation Mitigated the Developmental Toxicity of
   Polyamide Microplastics to Zebrafish Larvae by Modulating
   Macrophage-Triggered Proinflammatory Responses and Apoptosis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and pose substantial threats to the water ecosystem. However, the impact of natural aging of MPs on their toxicity has rarely been considered. This study found that visible light irradiation with hydrogen peroxide at environmentally relevant concentration for 90 days significantly altered the physicochemical properties and mitigated the toxicity of polyamide (PA) fragments to infantile zebrafish. The size of PA particles was reduced from similar to 8.13 to similar to 6.37 mu m, and nanoparticles were produced with a maximum yield of 5.03%. The end amino groups were volatilized, and abundant oxygen-containing groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl) and carbon-centered free radicals were generated, improving the hydrophilicity and colloidal stability of degraded MPs. Compared with pristine PA, the depuration of degraded MPs mediated by multixenobiotics resistance was much quicker, leading to markedly lower bioaccumulation in fish and weaker inhibition on musculoskeletal development. By integrating transcriptomics and transgenic zebrafish [Tg(lyz:EGFP)] tests, differences in macrophages-triggered proinflammatory effects, apoptosis via IL-17 signaling pathway, and antioxidant damages were identified as the underlying mechanisms for the attenuated toxicity of degraded MPs. This work highlights the importance of natural degradation on the toxicity of MPs, which has great implications for risk assessment of MPs.

TI Do Invasive Mussels Restrict Offshore Phosphorus Transport in Lake
   Huron?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Dreissenid mussels were first documented in the Laurentian Great Lakes in the late 1980s. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread quickly into shallow, hard-substrate areas; quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) spread more slowly and are currently colonizing deep, offshore areas. These mussels occur at high densities, filter large water volumes while feeding on suspended materials, and deposit particulate waste on the lake bottom. This filtering activity has been hypothesized to sequeter tributary phosphorus in near-shore regions reducing offshore primary productivity. We used a mass balance model to estimate the phosphorus sedimentation rate in Saginaw Bay, a shallow embayment of Lake Huron, before and after the mussel invasion. Our results indicate that the proportion of tributary phosphorus retained in Saginaw Bay increased from approximately 46-70% when dreissenids appeared, reducing phosphorus export to the main body of Lake Huron. The combined effects of increased phosphorus retention and decreased phosphorus loading have caused an approximate 60% decrease in phosphorus export from Saginaw Bay to Lake Huron. Our results support the hypothesis that the ongoing decline of preyfish and secondary producers including diporeia (Diporeia spp.) in Lake Huron is a bottom-up phenomenon associated with decreased phosphorus availability in the offshore to support primary production.

   stability and shallow-water food webs
SO ESTUARIES
CT 1st Marine and Estuarine Shallow Water Science and Management Conference
CY MAR 08-11, 1994
CL ATLANTIC CITY, NJ
AB The microphytobenthos form an important component of all shallow-water ecosystems where enough light reaches the sediment surface to support appreciable primary production. Although less conspicuous than macroalgae or vascular plants, the microphytobenthos can contribute significantly to primary production and can modify habitat characteristics. The microphytobenthos alter sediment properties (e.g., erodibility) both directly, in the extreme forming a mat or scum on the sediment surface, and indirectly by modifying the activities of benthic infauna (e.g., pelletization, burrowing, tube building; and sediment tracking). Carbon dioxide fixed by the microphytobenthos supports higher, grazing trophic levels. These include deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding macrofauna as well as meiofauna and microfauna. Quantitative relations between the feeding and growth rates of macrofauna and the abundance of microphytobenthos and suspended organic matter (i.e., functional responses) are reviewed. Given the current state of knowledge of the direct and indirect interactions involving trophic dynamics, sediment properties, and benthic microalgae, we argue for reductionist studies of particular interactions as distinct entities. This is a prerequisite for the emergence of a comprehensive picture of unvegetated ecosystems and the ability to predict their responses to man's activities.

TI Utilization of chemically modified coal fly ash as cost-effective
   adsorbent for removal of hazardous organic wastes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Disposal of dyes wastewater into aquatic streams is considered as a major challenge due to its effect on water ecosystem. Direct dyes have a complex aromatic structure. Therefore, it is difficult to separate them from industrial wastewater. Conversely, fly ash is a main by-product pollutant generated from coal burning to fulfill energy requirements. In this study, thermochemical treatment process was applied to coal fly ash (CFA) in order to increase its surface area, improve its pore's structure and enhancing its adsorption capacity for direct blue 78 dye (DB78) removal. The treated coal fly ash (TCFA) was characterized by physicochemical analyses such as XRD, XRF, TGA, SEM, FTIR, surface area (S-BET) and particles size analysis. Batch experiments were conducted to analyze the adsorption behavior for TCFA and to examine the DB78 dye removal efficiency. The physicochemical analysis results indicated that a higher increase in CFA surface area from 9.6 to 60.4 m(2)g(-1) was obtained due to the modification process. The maximum removal efficiency using TCFA was 99.7% for initial dye concentration 10 mg/L and TCFA dose 2 g/L. The adsorption isotherm was studied by Langmuir and Freundlich model using different dye concentrations. The results showed that equilibrium data followed closely Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 = 0.99) indicating monolayer and homogeneous adsorption process.

TI Recognizing, normalizing and articulating: An approach to highlight
   plural values of water ecosystem services in Colombia
SO HELIYON
AB The dialectical relationship between ecosystems and society is complex; therefore, holistic approaches are required to address this complexity. This view also stands out in the ecosystem services valuation field, where different scholars and global platforms have drawn attention to the need to incorporate plural valuation initiatives at decision-making. In this sense, through a comprehensive design, we conducted a multi-layered valuation of ecosystem services, and we highlighted multiple values in two areas of the province of Caldas, Colombia. We proposed a three-phase valuation process called Recognizing, Normalizing and Articulating values. Then, in cooperation with the regional environmental authority, we obtained different water-related ecosystem services values. Our results showed some warnings: first, we found mismatches between ecosystem services values; second, people assigned high values to ecosystems but the actual capacity of ecosystems to support ES is low. Finally, monetary values were marginal compared to social and ecological values. We conclude by saying that the more strata are assessed, the more values appear in the valuation scenarios, and those values could be conflicting. Our results have political implications, since they highlight the need to incorporate plural values as a fundamental tool for planning and land use in real scenarios where conflicts of interest and values are evident.

TI Response of macroinvertebrates to industrial warm discharges: the River
   Shannon case study (Ireland)
SO INLAND WATERS
AB Warm discharges from industrial processes have the potential to impact benthic invertebrate communities and undermine river functioning as well as inform climate change impacts. We evaluated the effects of heated cooling waters from 2 power plants across 2 River Shannon locations (Ireland) in summer and in winter. The overall multivariate community composition differed significantly between heated and unheated river sections in both seasons. In summer, overall invertebrate taxon richness and diversity were significantly lower in heated than in unheated sections. This finding was coupled with a striking decrease in Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) abundance, taxon richness, and diversity in heated sections. Furthermore, aerial taxon richness and diversity were significantly lower in the heated sections. We also observed that the abundance of grazers was lower in heated sections. Winter patterns were similar to summer, but with lower invertebrate community abundance and decreased functional representation of shredders, gatherers, and predators in heated sections. Such impacts likely have strong implications for river functioning, including depressed connectivity with riparian habitats, and may impair the performance of eutrophication biomonitoring tools that rely on EPT taxa. Our results highlight the impact of warming of thermal plumes and other ubiquitous triggers of heating and may indicate climate change-driven trajectories.

SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Various algal periphyton and aquatic macrophyte co-existence determine the foraging and breeding ground of several aquatic animals and thus receiving immense importance in aquaculture worldwide. Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria spiralis, & Ceratophyllum demersum are the three most dominant aquatic macrophytes of fresh water ecosystems in tropical countries. They vary on their architecture, leaf morphology and surface texture that provide different substratum / habitat conditions for various algal periphyton. Present study was under taken to find out if there is any preference of the periphyton algae to the surface habitat of that the aquatic macrophytes. Algal periphyton association based on the shape / morphology and overall association between them was studied following 2 X 2 and multiple species association index. Crowded and Whorled phyllotaxy of Hydrilla verticillata support heighest algal periphyton diversity on its surface through providing a fabulous micro habitat. From the association analysis of periphyton, based on their shape / morphology, the highest significant true positive association was observed between coccoid and discoid - coccoid and discoid form followed by filamentous-single cell form. Schulter Variance Ratio followed by Willcoxon test shows that the highest overall positive association between the algal periphyton genera on the surface of Ceratophyllum demersum indicating the strategic sustenance of algal periphyton community rather avoidance on the unfavourable spiny rough surface morphology of the macrophyte.

TI Aquatic invasive species: challenges for the future
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Humans have effectively transported thousands of species around the globe and, with accelerated trade; the rate of introductions has increased over time. Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species ("invasional meltdown"). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.

CT Sustainable Asia Conference 2014
CY APR 23-25, 2014
CL Nanchang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB The likelihood of an ecological system to undergo undesired regime shifts is expected to increase as climate change effects unfold. To understand how regional climate settings can affect resilience; i.e., the ability of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbances without changing its original structure and processes, we used a synchronized mesocosm experiment (representative of shallow lakes) along a latitudinal gradient. We manipulated nutrient concentrations and water levels in a synchronized mesocosm experiment in different climate zones across Europe involving Sweden, Estonia, Germany, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Greece. We assessed attributes of zooplankton communities that might contribute to resilience under different ecological configurations. We assessed four indicator of relative ecological resilience (cross-scale, within-scale structures, aggregation length and gap size) of zooplankton communities, inferred from discontinuity analysis. Similar resilience attributes were found across experimental treatments and countries, except Greece, which experienced severe drought conditions during the experiment. These conditions apparently led to a lower relative resilience in the Greek mesocosms. Our results indicate that zooplankton community resilience in shallow lakes is marginally affected by water level and the studied nutrient range unless extreme drought occurs. In practice, this means that drought mitigation could be especially challenging in semi-arid countries in the future.

TI Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals a Morphological Differentiation of
   Chromobacterium violaceum Cells Associated with Biofilm Development and
   Directed by N-Hexanoyl-L-Homoserine Lactone
SO PLOS ONE
AB Chromobacterium violaceum abounds in soil and water ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions and occasionally causes severe and often fatal human and animal infections. The quorum sensing (QS) system and biofilm formation are essential for C. violaceum's adaptability and pathogenicity, however, their interrelation is still unknown. C. violaceum's cell and biofilm morphology were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in comparison with growth rates, QS-dependent violacein biosynthesis and biofilm biomass quantification. To evaluate QS regulation of these processes, the wild-type strain C. violaceum ATCC 31532 and its mini-Tn5 mutant C. violaceum NCTC 13274, cultivated with and without the QS autoinducer N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C-6-HSL), were used. We report for the first time the unusual morphological differentiation of C. violaceum cells, associated with biofilm development and directed by the QS autoinducer. AFM revealed numerous invaginations of the external cytoplasmic membrane of wild-type cells, which were repressed in the mutant strain and restored by exogenous C-6-HSL. With increasing bacterial growth, polymer matrix extrusions formed in place of invaginations, whereas mutant cells were covered with a diffusely distributed extracellular substance. Thus, quorum sensing in C. violaceum involves a morphological differentiation that organises biofilm formation and leads to a highly differentiated matrix structure.

TI The Use of Natural Sorbents for Spilled Crude Oil and Diesel Cleanup
   from the Water Surface
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Oil spills impose serious damage to the environment. A spilled crude oil or its products affect aquatic flora and fauna and influence the atmosphere as well. Such pollutants are especially dangerous for the water ecosystems, where biological self-purification processes are slower (for example the Baltic Sea), than in warmer regions. In this paper, we evaluate a sorption capacity of ecologically friendly natural sorbents, when the crude oil and diesel are spilled on the surface of water. The experiments are carried out in the laboratory, and the water from the Lithuanian Baltic Sea coastline and Curonian Lagoon is used. Moss, straw, wool, sawdust, and peat are the natural sorbents evaluated during the experiments. Chromatographic analysis of crude oil and diesel during the process of sorption was conducted as well. An experiment with some synthetic sorbents was carried out to compare the results with natural ones. The experiments showed that the most suitable material for crude oil or diesel fuel spilled on the water surface is peat. As well, Lagergren's model was adopted to the case of the sorption processes we have investigated. It can be exploited as a decision support tool while deciding the required time interval to achieve maximum sorption capacity of the sorbent in use.

TI Risk Assessment and Ecotoxicology Limitations and Recommendations for
   Ocean Disposal of Mine Waste in the Coral Triangle
SO OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Mining is an important contribution to the economy of many developing tropical regions. Many sites of mining interest in the tropics have island geographies and potentially limited land area. While the limited land area may drive consideration of tailings disposal to the ocean, it is important to recognize that local communities depend on the ocean as a major supplier of dietary protein. Impact assessment of tailings disposal to the ocean is usually limited by budgets and time frames that result in a limited capacity to understand longer-term risks to food chains and marine ecosystems, including the interactions between deeper- and shallower-water ecosystems. This article reviews three factors-tailing characterization, ecotoxicology, and bioaccumulation/biomagnification-in relation to the current application of these methods to risk assessment of submarine tailings disposal (STD), and it identifies ways to improve current practices. A decision-tree approach has been developed specific to STD risk assessment for implementation at the pre-proposal stage of a project. This decision tree highlights the urgent need for development and application of suitable and relevant risk assessment tools for tropical marine environments and identifies opportunities for intergovernmental standards for risk assessment of marine disposal of mine tailings within the framework of the Coral Triangle Initiative.

TI Isotopic Determination of Food Web Origins in Restoring and Ancient
   Estuarine Wetlands of the San Francisco Bay and Delta
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB We compared the extent to which ancient and restoring wetlands in three estuary regions of San Francisco Bay support estuarine ecosystems through food web contributions. In comparison to mature marshes, we hypothesized that food webs of increasingly younger restoration sites would display increased dependency upon allochthonous subsidies due to nominal internal production. Using multiple stable isotopes (delta(13)C, delta(15)N, delta(34)S) in a mixing model, we traced links among primary producers and estuarine consumers. Results indicate that food webs of estuarine marshes are heavily dependent upon autochthonous marsh materials (76 +/- 17%), even within the youngest restoration marshes (11 years). Nearly all sampled organisms relied upon autochthonous marsh materials, with the exception of Neomysis kadiakensis, a mysid shrimp, which derived the majority of its support from freshwater-produced phytoplankton. Marsh-derived organic matter (OM) support was consistent both temporally throughout the year and spatially along the three estuary regions, but evidence suggests that the specific type of OM supporting estuarine consumers depends on position along the estuarine gradient and on seasonal shifts in freshwater flow. These results indicate that wetland restoration rapidly provides important contributions to marsh consumers and potentially bolsters food web linkages in shallow-water ecosystems.

TI The effect of dreissenid invasions on chlorophyll and the chlorophyll:
   total phosphorus ratio in north-temperate lakes
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB We investigated the effects of dreissenid mussel (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) invasions on the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus(TP), and the Chl: TP ratio within 27 north-temperate lakes that spanned large gradients in lake size and trophic status, using two approaches: (i) regression analysis and (ii) hierarchical modeling. Overall, Chl declined by 40%-45% after dreissenid invasion and the magnitude of effect was structured by epilimnetic volume within stratified, but not nonstratified (mixed) lakes. Declines in TP over the invasion period were significant only for stratified systems and were smaller (similar to 16% reduction from pre-invasion values) than for Chl. Across the complete trophic gradient (i. e., among lakes) the regression approach (analysis of covariance) indicated a significant decline in the intercept of the Chl: TP, but not the slope. In contrast, hierarchical modeling indicated a decline in the slope of Chl: TP among lakes between pre- and post-invasion periods. As with Chl, the effect of dreissenids on Chl: TP declined with increases in epilimnetic volume in stratified, but not nonstratified lakes. Dreissenid effects on Chl were prolonged, with no indication of diminishing within 7-10 years of invasion.

TI Effects of macro-detritivores density on leaf detritus processing rate:
   a macrocosm experiment
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB The effect of macroinvertebrate detritivore density on the mass loss rates of leaf litter of Alnus glutinosa (alder) was assessed. Experimental freshwater macrocosms, with increasing densities of four species of macroinvertebrate detritivores belonging to two functional groups (shredders and scrapers), were set up outdoors. The litter bag technique was used to assess decomposition rates of alder leaves. Indirect effects of increasing density of macroinvertebrates on phytoplankton standing crop in the water column were investigated by analysing Chlorophyll a concentration. Decomposition rate increased as animal density increased, although a continuous increase in detritivores density resulted in a discrete, step-wise increase of the decomposition rates. Animal colonisation followed an exponential pattern in low-medium density treatments versus a typical 'bell-shape' curve in high density treatments; animals started to leave the consumed patches when about 60% of the initial leaf mass was lost (35th day in high-density treatments). Diversity (Hs) of the simplified detritivore community decreased as decomposition proceeded, with a dominance of shredders during the last phase of decomposition. Faster decomposition rate of detritus in the benthic compartment lead to a higher microalgae standing crop in the water column emphasising the role of allochthonous detritus as a source of nutrients for algae primary production in coastal freshwater ecotones.

TI Framing biophysical and societal implications ofmultiple stressor
   effects on river networks
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Urbanization, agriculture, and the manipulation of the hydrological cycle are the main drivers of multiple stressors affecting river ecosystems across the world. Physical, chemical, and biological stressors follow characteristic patterns of occurrence, intensity, and frequency, linked to human pressure and socio-economic settings. The societal perception of stressor effects changes when moving from broad geographic regions to narrower basin or waterbody scales, as political and ecologically based perspectives change across scales. Current approaches relating the stressor effects on river networks and human societies fail to incorporate complexities associated to their co-occurrence, such as: i) the evidence that drivers can be associated to different stressors; ii) their intensity and frequency may differ across spatial and temporal scales; iii) their differential effects on biophysical receptors may be related to their order of occurrence; iv) current and legacy stressors may produce unexpected outcomes; v) the potentially different response of different biological variables to stressor combinations; vi) the conflicting effects of multiple stressors on ecosystem services; and, vii) management of stressor effects should consider multiple occurrence scales. We discuss how to incorporate these aspects to present frameworks considering biophysical and societal consequences of multiple stressors, to better understand and manage the effects being caused on river networks.

TI Salinisation of rivers: An urgent ecological issue
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Secondary salinisation of rivers and streams is a global and growing threat that might be amplified by climate change. It can have many different causes, like irrigation, mining activity or the use of salts as deicing agents for roads. Freshwater organisms only tolerate certain ranges of water salinity. Therefore secondary salinisation has an impact at the individual, population, community and ecosystem levels, which ultimately leads to a reduction in aquatic biodiversity and compromises the goods and services that rivers and streams provide. Management of secondary salinization should be directed towards integrated catchment strategies (e.g. benefiting from the dilution capacity of the rivers) and identifying threshold salt concentrations to preserve the ecosystem integrity. Future research on the interaction of salinity with other stressors and the impact of salinization on trophic interactions and ecosystem properties is needed and the implications of this issue for human society need to be seriously considered.

TI Heterogeneous electro-Fenton using three-dimension NZVI-BC electrodes
   for degradation of neonicotinoid wastewater
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Neonicotinoids (NEOs), as the most widely used pesticides, pose a serious threat to water ecosystems, especially clothianidin (CLO). However, the degradation behavior of CLO, as a new type of persistent organic pollutant, is rarely studied in wastewater treatment. To bridge this gap, heterogeneous electroFenton system using three-dimension electrodes made of biochar-supported zero-valent iron nanoparticle hybrid material (NZVI-BC), abbreviated as 3D-ICE-EF system, is invented and initially applied in CLO wastewater degradation, without the addition of Fenton reagent. NZVI-BC in 3D-ICE-EF system can concentrate CLO on electrodes by excellent adsorption and effectively eliminate it to achieve selfcleaning effect. In addition, the deposition of iron mud (Fe(OH)3) and the circular utilization of Fe in Fenton system is effectively improved by the addition of hydroquinone (HQ) in 3D-ICE-EF system. The pH applicable scope of Fenton system is extended to alkaline condition by the applications of NZVI-BC electrodes. The increase in the acidity of electrolyte is considered the primary reason of the high degradation efficiency of CLO in 3D-ICE-EF system at an initial pH of 9.0. The degradation performance of 3D-ICE-EF system tends to be promoted by the increase of current intensity and air flow rate. Seven plausible mechanisms of CLO degradation were identified in 3D-ICE-EF system. The ecotoxicity evaluation of degradation products indicated that CLO degradation in 3D-ICE-EF system exhibits a remarkable tendency to reduce toxicity levels. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of Aquatic Macrophytes on Spatial Distribution and Feeding
   Habits of Exotic Fish Species Lepomis macrochirus and Micropterus
   salmoides in Shallow Reservoirs in South Korea
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Aquatic macrophytes determine the physical complexity of aquatic environments and may influence the distribution and feeding habits of fish species. We explored the influence of different microhabitats, including vegetated beds (VB), edges of vegetated beds (EVB), and open water zones (OW), on two exotic fish species (Lepomis macrochirus and Micropterus salmoides) in shallow reservoirs. Lepomis macrochirus was more abundant in VB than in other zones and M. salmoides was mainly distributed in EVB. In VB, L. macrochirus mainly consumed branchiopods and isopods, while M. salmoides in EVB relied on relatively larger food items, such as dipterans, odonatans, and young fish. The consumption of young fish by M. salmoides, including L. macrochirus, showed little difference between winter and summer. Based on these findings, we suggest that young L. macrochirus (similar to 20 cm) utilize VB as a refuge to avoid predation by M. salmoides. Meanwhile, M. salmoides mainly occupied in areas surrounding VB, preying on animals at these edges. As such, the presence of aquatic macrophytes appears to plays a key role in the survival and population growth of L. macrochirus. Proper management of aquatic macrophytes can help reduce populations of exotic fish and support native fish species.

TI Evaluation of Agricultural Water Resources Carrying Capacity and Its
   Influencing Factors: A Case Study of Townships in the Arid Region of
   Northwest China
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB The water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) strongly determines the agricultural development in arid areas. Evaluation of WRCC is important in balancing the availability of water resources with society's economic and environmental demands. Given the demand for sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources, we combine the water stress index and comprehensive index of WRCC and use multi-source data to evaluate agricultural WRCC and its influencing factors at the township scale. It makes up for the deficiencies of current research, such as the existence of single-index evaluation systems, limited calibration data, and a lack of a sub-watershed (i.e., township) scale. By applying multi-source data, this study expands the spatial scale of WRCC assessment and establishes a multidimensional evaluation framework for the water resources in dryland agriculture. The results indicate water stress index ranges from 0.52 to 1.67, and the comprehensive index of WRCC ranges from 0.25 to 0.70, which are significantly different in different types of irrigation areas and townships. Water quantity and water management are key factors influencing WRCC, the water ecosystem is an area requiring improvement, and the water environment is not a current constraint. Different irrigation areas and different types of townships should implement targeted measures to improve WRCC.

TI Drivers of ecosystem vulnerability to Corbicula invasions in
   southeastern North America
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Invasive species introduction is one of the major ongoing ecological global crises. Identifying factors responsible for the success of invasive species is key for the implementation of effective management actions. The invasive filter-feeding bivalve, Corbicula, is of particular interest because it has become ubiquitous in many river basins across North America and elsewhere. Here we sampled bivalve assemblages, environmental indicators, and land cover parameters in the Ouachita highlands in southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Arkansas, and in the Gulf Coastal Plain of Alabama to test three working models (using structural equation modeling, SEM) based on a priori scientific knowledge regarding Corbicula invasions. Our models tested three competing hypotheses: (1) Native mussel declines are related to land use changes at the watershed level and subsequent Corbicula colonization is a result of an empty niche; (2) Corbicula abundance is one of the factors responsible for native mussel declines and has an interactive effect with land use change at the watershed level; (3) Native mussel declines and Corbicula success are both related to land use changes at the watershed level. We found no evidence for the first two hypotheses. However, we found that environmental indicators and land cover parameters at the watershed scale were robust predictors of Corbicula abundance. In particular, agricultural land cover was positively related with Corbicula density. These results suggest that further improvement of conventional agricultural practices including the optimization of fertilizer delivery systems may represent an opportunity to manage this species by limiting nutrient inputs to stream ecosystems. Preservation of extensive floodplain habitats may help buffer these inputs by providing key ecosystem services including sediment and nutrient retention.

TI Miniaturized Temperature-Controlled Planar Chromatography (Micro-TLC) as
   a Versatile Technique for Fast Screening of Micropollutants and
   Biomarkers Derived from Surface Water Ecosystems and During
   Technological Processes of Wastewater Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL
AB There is increasing interest in the development of simple analytical systems enabling the fast screening of target components in complex samples. A number of newly invented protocols are based on quasi separation techniques involving microfluidic paper-based analytical devices and/or micro total analysis systems. Under such conditions, the quantification of target components can be performed mainly due to selective detection. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that miniaturized planar chromatography has the capability to work as an efficient separation and quantification tool for the analysis of multiple targets within complex environmental samples isolated and concentrated using an optimized SPE method. In particular, we analyzed various samples collected from surface water ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and the Baltic Sea of Middle Pomerania in the northern part of Poland) in different seasons, as well as samples collected during key wastewater technological processes (originating from the "Jamno" wastewater treatment plant in Koszalin, Poland). We documented that the multiple detection of chromatographic spots on RP-18W microplates-under visible light, fluorescence, and fluorescence quenching conditions, and using the visualization reagent phosphomolybdic acid enables fast and robust sample classification. The presented data reveal that the proposed micro-TLC system is useful, inexpensive, and can be considered as a complementary method for the fast control of treated sewage water discharged by a municipal wastewater treatment plant, particularly for the detection of low molecular mass micropollutants with polarity ranging from estetrol to progesterone, as well as chlorophyll-related dyes. Due to the low consumption of mobile phases composed of water alcohol binary mixtures (less than 1 mL/run for the simultaneous separation of up to nine samples), this method can be considered an environmentally friendly and green chemistry analytical tool. The described analytical protocol can be complementary to those involving classical column chromatography (HPLC) or various planar microfluidic devices.

TI Archaeal community compositions in tilapia pond systems and their
   influencing factors
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Archaea, like the bacterial communities are gradually being realized as key players in the biogeochemical progress of water ecosystems. In this study, tilapia aquaculture ponds were used for an in-depth understanding of archaeal community compositions in water and surface sediment. Some of the main functions, as well as the communities' response patterns, to time variations, pond differences and some physio-chemical parameters were investigated. The results revealed the dominant phylum in both the water and surface sediment, as Euryarchaeota, while, the most abundant classes were: Halobacteria and Methanomicrobia respectively. Significant differences in the archaeal community compositions in the water and surface sediment, were observed in the early stages of cultivation, which became minimal at the later stage of the GIFT tilapia cultivation. Additionally to the differences in the most abundant classes, more OTUs were observed in water samples than in surface sediment samples. The methane generation could be attributed to the large proportion of methanogens found in both pond water and in the surface sediment. Furthermore, the archaeal community compositions in water and the surface sediment were shaped mainly by temporal variations and pond differences respectively. In the pond water, the archaeal community compositions were highly co-related to the concentration changes of ammonia, sulfate and total nitrogen; while in the surface sediment, the correlation to the content changes was significant in total phosphorus. The archaeal community compositions in surface sediment should be considered as an indicator for future environmental capacity studies in aquaculture.

TI Environmental and Endogenous Factors Influencing Emigration in Juvenile
   Anadromous Alewives
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
AB We analyzed migration of juvenile anadromous alewives Alosa pseudoharengus at Bride Lake, a coastal lake in Connecticut, during summer 2006 and found that migration on 24-h and seasonal time scales was influenced by conditions of the environment and characteristics of the individual fish. To identify environmental cues of juvenile migration, we continuously video-recorded fish at the lake outflow and employed information-theoretic model selection to identify the best predictors of daily migration rate. More than 80% of the approximately 320,000 juvenile alewives that migrated from mid-June to mid-August departed in three pulses lasting 1 or 2 d. Pulses of migration were associated with precipitation events, transient decreases in water temperature, and transient increases in stream discharge. Diel timing of migration shifted over the summer. Early in the season, most migration occurred around dawn; late in the season, migration occurred at night. To identify individual characteristics associated with migratory behavior, we compared migrating juveniles collected as they were exiting Bride Lake with nonmigrating juveniles collected from the center of the lake. Migrants were a nonrandom subset of the population; they were on average 1-12 mm larger, were 2-14 d older, had grown more rapidly (11% greater length at age), and were in better condition (14% greater mass at length) than nonmigrant fish. We infer that the amount of accumulated energy has a positive effect on the net benefit of migration at any time in the migratory season.

TI Heterogeneity preferences and willingness to pay for environmental
   services: Evidence from Iran
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Environmental challenges such as soil salinity and desertification have been concerns of Iran's agricultural sector in recent decades. Payment for ecological characteristics is one of the market methods of protection which has received much attention. One of the areas that have been plagued by such problems in the last decade is the aquifer of the Dasht-e-Abbas of Ilam province. This study examines the preferences and willingness to pay farmers to maintain and improve the aquifer of Dasht-e-Abbas. For this purpose, the choice experiment method and mixed logit and latent class models were used. The required information was obtained by completing a questionnaire and interviews with 108 farmers in 2021. The results obtained from both models confirmed the existence of heterogeneity in farmers' preferences, and the variables age, environmental orientation, and groundwater use were identified as heterogeneity factors. The mixed logit model and latent class results showed that the characteristics of reed level, soil salinity, and desertification have the highest priority from farmers' perspectives, respectively. The maximum willingness to pay for these two attributes has been 420 and 256 thousand Iran Rials per month per hectare. Based on the results, there is a need for the authorities to take effective action by holding extension classes related to the importance of the environment and the problems associated with this aquifer.

SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
AB Running water ecosystems of Europe are affected by various human pressures. However, little is known about the prevalence, spatial patterns, interactions with natural environment and co-occurrence of pressures. This study represents the first high-resolution data analysis of human pressures at the European scale, where important pressure criteria for 9330 sampling sites in 14 European countries were analysed. We identified 15 criteria describing major anthropogenic degradation and combined these into a global pressure index by taking additive effects of multiple pressures into account. Rivers are affected by alterations of water quality (59%), hydrology (41%) and morphology (38%). Connectivity is disrupted at the catchment level in 85% and 35% at the river segment level. Approximately 31% of all sites are affected by one, 29% by two, 28% by three and 12% by four pressure groups; only 21% are unaffected. In total, 47% of the sites are multi-impacted. Approximately 90% of lowland rivers are impacted by a combination of all four pressure groups.

TI Salinity Is a Key Determinant for the Microeukaryotic Community in Lake
   Ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, China
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The arid and semiarid areas experienced remarkable lake shrinkage during recent decades due to intensive human activities and climate change, which would result in unprecedented changes of microeukaryotic communities. However, little is known about how climate change affects the structure and ecological mechanisms of microeukaryotic communities in this area. Here, we used an 18S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing approach to explore the structure, interspecies interaction, and assembly processes of the microeukaryotic community in lake ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau. As a direct result of climate change, salinity has become the key determinant of the lacustrine microeukaryotic community in this region. The microeukaryotic community in this ecosystem can be divided into three groups: salt (Lake Daihai), brackish (Lake Dalinuoer) and freshwater lakes. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that salinity shapes the interspecies interactions of the microeukaryotic community. This causes interspecies interactions to change from antagonistic to cooperative with an increase in salinity. Phylogenetic-based beta-nearest taxon distance analyses revealed that stochastic processes mainly dominated the microeukaryotic community assembly in lake ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, and salinity stress drove the assembly processes of the microeukaryotic community from stochastic to deterministic. Overall, these findings expand the current understanding of interspecies interactions and assembly processes of microeukaryotic communities during climate change in lake ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau.

TI Enhanced Nutrient Removal in A(2)N Effluent by Reclaimed Biochar
   Adsorption
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The excessive nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into the water environment will cause water eutrophication and thus disrupt the water ecosystem and even exert biological toxicities. In this study, the absorption removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the anaerobic tank in an anaerobic-anoxic/nitrifying system using four different kinds of biowaste-reclaimed biochars were investigated and compared. The effects of temperature and pH on nutrient adsorption removal were further investigated. The four kinds of biochar were successfully prepared and well characterized using a scanning electron microscope, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Brunner-Emmet-Teller methods. Generally, there was no significant change in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal efficiencies when treated by the different biochars, while the activated sludge biochar (ASB) displayed the highest total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency. The initial TP concentrations (<40 mg/L) displayed no remarkable effects on the TP adsorption removal, while the increase of temperature generally enhanced TP and NH4+-N adsorptions on the ASB. Besides, the increase of pH significantly promoted NH4+-N removal but depressed TP removal. Moreover, the adsorption process of TP by the ASB complies with the secondary kinetic model, suggesting the chemical precipitation and physical electrostatic interaction mechanisms of TP adsorption removal. However, the adsorption of NH4+-N conformed to the inner-particle diffusion model, indicating that the NH4+-N adsorption was mainly involved with pore diffusions in the particles.

TI A mechanism study on toxicity of graphene oxide to Daphnia magna: Direct
   link between bioaccumulation and oxidative stress
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Graphene oxide (GO) possesses versatile applicability and high hydrophilicity, thus may have frequent contact with aquatic organisms. However, the ecological risks of GO in aquatic ecosystems remain largely unexplored currently. This study evaluated the comprehensive toxicological effects of GO on Daphnia magna, a key species in fresh water ecosystem. The results revealed nonsevere acute toxicities, including immobility (72 h EC50: 443 mg/L) and mortality (72 h LC50: 45.4 mg/L), of GO on D. magna. To understand the underlying mechanism of GO exposure, changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) of D. magna exposed to GO were correlated, which revealed elevated GO-mediated oxidative stress and damages, especially in the long-time and high-dose exposure groups. The observations of in vivo fluorescence labeled with 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin further demonstrated that reactive oxygen species were concentrated in daphnia guts, which corresponded with the high bioaccumulation level (5 mg/L, 24 h body burden: 107.9 g/kg) of GO in daphnia guts. However, deputation of GO from daphnia was not difficult. Daphnia almost released all GO within 24 h after it was transferred to clean water. These results hence suggest that GO could accumulate and induce significant oxidative stress in the gut of D. magna, while D. daphnia can also relieve the acute toxicity by depurating GO.

TI pH up-regulation as a potential mechanism for the cold-water coral
   Lophelia pertusa to sustain growth in aragonite undersaturated
   conditions
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB Cold-water corals are important habitat formers in deep-water ecosystems and at high latitudes. Ocean acidification and the resulting change in aragonite saturation are expected to affect these habitats and impact coral growth. Counter to expectations, the deep water coral Lophelia pertusa has been found to be able to sustain growth even in undersaturated conditions. However, it is important to know whether such undersaturation modifies the skeleton and thus its ecosystem functioning. Here we used Synchrotron X-Ray Tomography and Raman spectroscopy to examine changes in skeleton morphology and fibre orientation. We combined the morphological assessment with boron isotope analysis to determine if changes in growth are related to changes in control of calcification pH. We compared the isotopic composition and structure formed in their natural environment to material grown in culture at lower pH conditions. Skeletal morphology is highly variable but shows no distinctive differences between natural and low pH conditions. Raman investigations found no difference in macromorphological skeletal arrangement of early mineralization zones and secondary thickening between the treatments. The delta B-11 analyses show that L. pertusa up-regulates the internal calcifying fluid pH (pH(cf)) during calcification compared to ambient seawater pH and maintains a similar elevated pH(cf) at increased pCO(2) conditions. We suggest that as long as the energy is available to sustain the up-regulation, i.e. individuals are well fed, there is no detrimental effect to the skeletal morphology.

TI Salinity adaptation of the invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus
   antipodarum) in the Columbia River estuary (Pacific Northwest, USA):
   physiological and molecular studies
SO AQUATIC ECOLOGY
AB In this study, we examine salinity stress tolerances of two populations of the invasive species New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum, one population from a high salinity environment in the Columbia River estuary and the other from a fresh water lake. In 1996, New Zealand mud snails were discovered in the tidal reaches of the Columbia River estuary that is routinely exposed to salinity at near full seawater concentrations. In contrast, in their native habitat and throughout its spread in the western US, New Zealand mud snails are found only in fresh water ecosystems. Our aim was to determine whether the Columbia River snails have become salt water adapted. Using a modification of the standard amphipod sediment toxicity test, salinity tolerance was tested using a range of concentrations up to undiluted seawater, and the snails were sampled for mortality at daily time points. Our results show that the Columbia River snails were more tolerant of acute salinity stress with the LC50 values averaging 38 and 22 Practical Salinity Units for the Columbia River and freshwater snails, respectively. DNA sequence analysis and morphological comparisons of individuals representing each population indicate that they were all P. antipodarum. These results suggest that this species is salt water adaptable and in addition, this investigation helps elucidate the potential of this aquatic invasive organism to adapt to adverse environmental conditions.

TI Diversity of zoosporic true fungi and heterotrophic straminipiles in Las
   Canas stream (Buenos Aires, Argentina): assemblages colonizing baits
SO FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY
AB Zoosporic true fungi and heterotrophic straminipiles are phylogenetically unrelated groups of microorganisms playing similar ecological roles in food webs in fresh water ecosystems. As saprotrophs they are important decomposers of organic matter of animal and vegetal origin. However, there is still little research on most aspects of the ecology of these microorganisms. In this study the species composition of zoosporic true fungi (Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota) and heterotrophic straminipiles ( Hyphochytriomycota and Peronosporomycota), and their frequency, abundance and diversity on different types of baits were analyzed. Samples for characterizing the species composition were collected over a four-year period and for characterizing the structure of the assemblages at four dates during a one-year period. The relationship between some biological and environmental parameters were analysed. We expected that fluctuations in environmental factors during the year might lead to changes in the species composition and structure of the assemblages. Sixty-eight taxa were recovered with the baiting technique during the four-year period. The species composition was dependent primarily on the type of bait used. The structure of the assemblages also appeared to be more influenced by the type of baits available for colonization than by other environmental parameters. Even though the abundance of the taxa was associated with pH, nitrite, sulfate, soluble reactive phosphorous and dissolved oxygen concentrations. We did not find any differences in their richness, frequency, abundance and diversity during the year as expected.

TI Evolution of large body size in abalones (Haliotis): patterns and
   implications
SO PALEOBIOLOGY
AB Kelps and other fleshy macroalgae-dominant reef-inhabiting organisms in cool seas-may have radiated extensively following late Cenozoic polar cooling, thus triggering a chain of evolutionary change in the trophic ecology of nearshore temperate ecosystems. We explore this hypothesis through an analysis of body size in the abalones (Gastropoda; Haliotidae), a widely distributed group in modern oceans that displays a broad range of body sizes and contains fossil representatives from the late Cretaceous (60-75 Ma). Geographic analysis of maximum shell length in living abalones showed that small-bodied species, while most common in the Tropics, have a cosmopolitan distribution, whereas large-bodied species occur exclusively in cold-water ecosystems dominated by kelps and other macroalgae. The phylogeography of body size evolution in extant abalones was assessed by constructing a molecular phylogeny in a mix of large and small species obtained from different regions of the world. This analysis demonstrates that small body size is the plesiomorphic state and largeness has likely arisen at least twice. Finally, we compiled data on shell length from the fossil record to determine how (slowly or suddenly) and when large body size arose in the abalones. These data indicate that large body size appears suddenly at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. Our findings support the view that fleshy-algal dominated ecosystems radiated rapidly in the coastal oceans with the onset of the most recent glacial age. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of this change.

TI Organic Micropollutants in New York Lakes: A Statewide Citizen Science
   Occurrence Study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The widespread occurrence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) is a challenge for aquatic ecosystem management, and closing the gaps in risk assessment of OMPs requires a data-driven approach. One promising tool for increasing the spatiotemporal coverage of OMP data sets is through the active involvement of citizen volunteers to expand the scale of OMP monitoring. Working collaboratively with volunteers from the Citizens Statewide Lake Assessment Program (CSLAP), we conducted the first statewide study on OMP occurrence in surface waters of New York lakes. Samples collected by CSLAP volunteers were analyzed for OMPs by a suspect screening method based on mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Sixty-five OMPs were confirmed and quantified in samples from 111 lakes across New York. Hierarchical clustering of OMP occurrence data revealed the relevance of 11 most frequently detected OMPs for classifying the contamination status of lakes. Partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses prioritized three water quality parameters linked to agricultural and developed land uses (i.e., total dissolved nitrogen, specific conductance, and a wastewater-derived fluorescent organic matter component) as the best combination of predictors that partly explained the interlake variability in OMP occurrence. Lastly, the exposure-activity ratio approach identified the potential for biological effects associated with detected OMPs that warrant further biomonitoring studies. Overall, this work demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating citizen science approaches into the regional impact assessment of OMPs.

TI Barcelona Coastal Monitoring with the "Pati a Vela", a Traditional
   Sailboat Turned into an Oceanographic Platform
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Shelf waters near large cities, such as Barcelona, are affected not only by meteorological episodes but also by anthropogenic influence. Scientists usually use data from on-site coastal platforms to analyze and understand these complex water ecosystems because remote sensing satellites have low spatiotemporal resolution and do not provide reliable data so close to the coast. However, platforms with conventional oceanographic instrumentation are expensive to install and maintain. This study presents the scientific adaptation and initial measurements from a "pati a vela", which is a very popular unipersonal catamaran in Barcelona. This versatile sailing vessel has been adapted to contain several low-cost sensors and instruments to measure water properties. Here, we describe the setup of a multi-parameter prototype, and then focus on results obtained using a low-cost temperature profiler. First, the temperature data are compared and validated with another conventional oceanographic instrument used in monthly oceanographic cruises. Then, field measurements between July and November 2021 are used to explore the relationship between air and water temperature in the Barcelona coastal area, showing the seasonal evolution of the temperature profile. We conclude that citizen sampling from fully sustainable sailing boats may turn into an effective strategy to monitor the urban coastal waters.

TI Microplastic Variations in Land-Based Sources of Coastal Water Affected
   by Tropical Typhoon Events in Zhanjiang Bay, China
SO WATER
AB Increasingly serious microplastic pollution in coastal areas and the ecological threats associated with plastics have attracted global attention. The frequency and intensity of typhoons have increased owing to global warming, strongly influencing the distribution and composition of microplastics in coastal ecosystems. In this study, the abundance, composition, diversity, and flux of microplastics in three estuaries and one sewage outlet in Zhanjiang Bay (ZJB) were analyzed. The average abundance of microplastics from land-based sources increased 3.6-fold from 14.19 +/- 3.60 items/L before Typhoon Kompasu to 51.19 +/- 28.53 items/L after the typhoon (p < 0.05). In addition, the proportion of fiber and large microplastics increased after the typhoon. In all samples, microplastics 100-330 mu m in size were predominant, and blue was the most abundant color. The diversity in the color and size of microplastics increased after Typhoon Kompasu. The total daily flux of microplastics at the four stations entering ZJB was 3.95 x 10(11) items before the typhoon and 9.93 x 10(11) items after the typhoon, showing a 2.5-fold increase. This study demonstrated the influence of Typhoon Kompasu on microplastics from land-based sources of ZJB coastal waters and provided vital data for further study on MP pollution in coastal water ecosystems and the impact of typhoons on microplastics.

TI Phosphorus - The main limiting factor in riverine ecosystems in China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB River receive substantial nutrient inputs, and serve as the main channel for nitrogen and phosphorus to enter the lake, their nutrient control is of great significance to the alleviation of lake eutrophication. While nutrient limitation affects the primary productivity of water ecosystems and the biodiversity of aquatic communities, identifying the limiting fac-tors in riverine ecosystems across China remains elusive. Here, we explore which nutrients have a stronger effect on nutritional balance and aquatic ecosystems in China's rivers based on the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) observations from 1412 sampling sites in 2018. This study supports the following three main conclusions. Though the percentages of the sites with TN or TP exceeding the limits varied as per different mesotrophic targets, and TP (53.7 %) contributed more to nutrient enrichment than TN (46.3 %). In addition, the spatial distribution characteris-tics of river nutrients were high in the north (arid zone) and low in the south (humid zone) in China. According to four classification criteria of N:P ratio, 70.8 % of the sampling sites were attributed to phosphorus limiting, much higher than the sites with nitrogen limiting (4.1 %). TN and TP have a synergistic effect on river nutrients, while TP has a stronger regulation framework. Our results reveal that the nutrients in China's rivers are mainly phosphorus limiting, which implies that phosphorus-oriented best management practices are more likely to maintain the nutrient balance of rivers towards healthy aquatic ecosystems.Synopsis: Phosphorus is the key factor that affecting the stability and nutrient balance of riverine ecosystem.

TI Seasonal variations in the level of heavy metals in the water of minor
   rivers
SO BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
AB This article analyses the level of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Fe, Pb, Co, Ni, Cd) and characteristics of their transportation through the water of minor rivers in Rivne region, Ukraine. The levels of Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co in the waters of these fisheries exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit in different months. We found that the concentration of Pb and Cd did not exceed the permissible concentration limit in the waters of the fisheries during the year of research, while the level of other metals exceeded the permissible levels by 1.1 to 151.0 times. This research confirms that the surface waters of Rivne region are characterized by high concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, and nickel. The level of iron exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit by 1.1 to 5.0 times, the level of zinc by 1.5 to 15.0 times, that of manganese by1.3 to 6.7 times and the nickel level by 1.3 to 151.0 times in the fishery waters. In principle, the increase in the level of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) is connected with the lithological composition of reservoirs in the water-collecting areas of the investigated rivers, and besides with the significant influence of the anthropogenic load (fuel combustion, aqueous wastes of factory units, agricultural effluent, etc.), and with the increase in aquatic vegetation, pH balance, temperature change and so on. The appearance of iron-manganese compounds can be explained by natural causes such as reformation of the source minerals into secondary minerals in the conditions of pH level recession in water, which causes the release of these molecular entities; leaching of iron from the iron-manganese septarian nodules, a substantial amount of which is contained in the illuvial horizon. The increase in the level of zinc and nickel in the river water is connected with the leaching of these elements from subsurface rocks, soil and forest leaf litter. Atmospheric condensation is a significant source of the presence of nickel in the surface water. For the investigated rivers, the most significant factors in the water's chemical composition are physiographic (foremost, the character of the soil cover, intensivity of erosion, extent of forest and swamp cover) and anthropogenous impact. In the rivers of Rivne region high concentrations of heavy metals are the consequence of the long-term aggradation of abiotic and biotic substances of the water ecosystem. There is a tendency for a reduction in the concentration of most metals in the abiotic substances of the water reservoir during the vegetative season and an increase after the end of this season. This research shows that the high level of contamination of the water of Rivne region's minor rivers by the investigated heavy metal components is caused primarily by anthropogenic factors.

TI Response and recovery mechanisms of river microorganisms to gradient
   concentrations of estrogen
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB As an important ecological system on the earth, rivers have been influenced by the rapid development of urbanization, industrialization, and anthropogenic activities. Increasingly more emerging contaminants, such as estrogens, are discharged into the river environment. In this study, we conducted river water microcosmic experiments using in situ water to investigate the response mechanisms of microbial community when exposed to different concentrations of target estrogen (estrone, E1). Results showed that both exposure time and concentrations shaped the diversity of microbial community when exposed to E1. Deterministic process played a vital role in influencing microbial community over the entire sampling period. The influence of E1 on microbial community could last for a longer time even after the E1 has been degraded. The microbial community structure could not be restored to the undisturbed state by E1, even if disturbed by low concentrations of E1(1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L) for a short time. Our study suggests that estrogens could cause long-term disturbance to the microbial community of river water ecosystem and provides a theoretical basis for assessing the environmental risk of estrogens in rivers.

TI TESTATE AMOEBAE COMMUNITY IN PERMIAN SEDIMENTS OF INDIA
SO JOURNAL OF THE PALAEONTOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
AB Testate amoebae are protists which occur worldwide in fresh/brackish water ecosystems. During the geological time period, five mass extinction events were globally witnessed, but about 96% of species extinction occurred during Permian-Triassic (+/- 252 Ma) and Cretaceous-Tertiary (+/- 66 Ma) boundary. Here, in the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the testate amoebae species in sediments from the northern and southern part of India deposited during the Permian Period. Twenty six species have been recorded which belong to the family Arcellidae (6 spp.), Centropyxidae (8 spp.), Trigonopyxidae (2 spp.), Difflugiidae (7 spp.) and one each to Amphitremidae, Hyalospheniidae, and Trinematidae. The morphology and morphometry were studied in fossil specimens and their extant counterparts recorded from sub-tropical lakes in India. The dominance of Centropyxis, Arcella and Difflugia species is in general recorded in the present day ecosystem subjected to varied stresses, like temperature, rainfall, pH, dissolved oxygen, heavy metal content, etc. It is inferred that the fossil specimens survived the similar adverse climatic conditions and thus could overcome the two major mass extinction events. Statistical analysis of shell morphometry reveals minimum evolution in terms of the ratio of shell diameter and shell aperture.

TI A novel bentonite-humic acid composite material Bephos (TM) for removal
   of phosphate and ammonium from eutrophic waters
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A novel low-cost composite material was prepared (Bephos (TM)) by embedding Fe, Cu ions and humic acid using in the interlayer space of a natural bentonite. Bench-scale batch experiments were performed to examine its efficiency as adsorbent for phosphate and ammonium removal from natural waters. Phosphate and ammonium uptake was evaluated vs. pH in adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms. The effect of salinity (fresh, brackish and marine waters) and adsorption thermodynamics were also investigated. Bephos (TM) exhibits higher adsorption than other pertinent materials. Moreover Bephos (TM) is cable for simultaneous adsorption of both phosphorus and ammonia and this is an important advantage against other materials used to restore eutrophic water bodies. The maximum phosphate and ammonium adsorption capacities were 26.5 mg/g and 202.1 mg/g respectively. Bephos (TM) can function efficiently within a wide range of pH, e.g. 5-9. Adsorption kinetics showed that more than 90% and 70% removal of phosphate and ammonium respectively from water within 30 min. Bephos (TM) is potent for remediation of phosphate and ammonium at low concentrations that occur in natural water ecosystems. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Caprella watch: a new approach for monitoring butyltin residues in the
   ocean
SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB A comparative study on the butyltin levels in various organisms showed that marked bioaccumulation occurs in certain lower trophic levels; i.e. from seawater to phytoplankton and into caprellid amphipods, Caprella spp. Caprella spp., which inhabit al.-al communities and aquaculture beds in the subtidal zone, are small crustaceans with reduced movement and a life-span of less than 3 months. These characteristics indicate that Caprella spp. may be well-suited for monitoring butyltin residue changes over small spatial and temporal scales. Two groups of organisms, mussels and neogastropods, have been mainly used for monitoring butyltin in shallow water ecosystems. These invertebrates mainly inhabit the intertidal zone where the butyltin levels vary widely depending on the immersion period and exposure to the sea surface microlayer. Monitoring using neogastropods may also over estimate exposures after restrictions on tributyltin, since neogastropods show an irreversible response to residue changes owing to their long life-spans. Thus, we propose usage of Caprella spp. to monitor temporal and spatial changes in baseline concentrations of butyltins. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dystrophy and eutrophy in lake ecosystems: Implications of fluctuating
   inputs
SO OIKOS
AB Eutrophic and dystrophic states of lake ecosystems are associated with distinct differences in phosphorus (P) input, refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) input, and certain internal processes. Eutrophic lakes have high P input and high primary production. Dystrophic lakes have high RDOC input. In both types of lake, bacterial metabolism may help reduce RDOC levels. In dystrophic lakes, bacterial metabolism may be suppressed by low pH, and primary production is reduced due to light attenuation by RDOC. We analyzed several simple models to ask whether eutrophy and dystrophy are alternative stable states of lake ecosystems. In-lake processes could create alternative states under certain circumstances, but more likely watershed processes maintain eutrophy or dystrophy through contrasts in inputs of P and RDOC. Simulations suggest that pulses of RDOC result in dystrophic conditions that reverse very slowly. Land-use changes or climate fluctuations that change RDOC input rates may have long-lasting effects on trophic state of temperate and boreal lakes. Lack of information on microbial degradation of RDOC, and the dependency of degradation rate on RDOC levels, primary production, and pH, are major sources of uncertainty in our analysis and are suggested as priorities for further research.

TI 'Now it's not a billabong': eco-cultural assessment of billabong
   condition in remote northern Australia
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Globally, the value of integrating multiple knowledge systems is being recognised in ecosystem assessments, monitoring and management. This paper describes a participatory eco-cultural assessment of freshwater billabongs in the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia, that drew on Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) and Western science using social and natural science research methods. IEK holders were concerned about feral ungulates trampling and consuming traditional bush food resources and reducing water quality, affecting eco-cultural values of billabongs. We recorded qualitative IEK and conducted a multivariate snapshot assessment of billabong physiochemical water quality, ground condition, yarlbun (water lily) cover and macroinvertebrate assemblage that showed distinct seasonal variation. Although both knowledge systems revealed indicators of seasonal change over 1 year, IEK also revealed longer-term changes and that degradation of billabongs in the late dry season was exacerbated by feral ungulates. This participatory research illustrates how the condition of freshwater systems can be assessed using cross-cultural techniques, how these techniques can reveal more nuanced understandings of eco-cultural condition and the value of including IEK for setting ecological baselines and recording long-term change.

   polymorpha Pallas
SO INLAND WATER BIOLOGY
AB Quantitative and qualitative changes in the feeding spectra and growth patterns are studied in the larvae and juveniles of perch in artificial water ecosystems (mesocosms) in the presence of a filter-feeding zebra mussel. At a stocking density of 0.75 kg/m(2), the presence of a zebra mussel leads to a change in the feeding conditions of zooplankton, to a decrease in its abundance in regards to critical values for fish feeding, to an increase in the abundance of organisms of macrobenthos in the food, and to the rapid transition of the fish to feeding on chironomids. As a result of these changes, the growth rate of perch larvae decreases, their development at step D-1 is delayed, the differentiation of the juveniles by size is accelerated, their size and weight variability increases, and individual predators (cannibals) appear.

TI Dealing with Water Conflicts: A Comprehensive Review of MCDM Approaches
   to Manage Freshwater Ecosystem Services
SO LAND
AB This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches exclusively to water-related freshwater ecosystem services. MCDM analysis has been useful in solving conflicts and it works well in this framework, given the serious conflicts historically associated with water use and the protection of freshwater ecosystems around the world. In this study, we present a review of 150 papers that proposed the use of MCDM-based methods for the social, economic, or ecological planning and management of water ecosystem services over the period 2000-2020. The analysis accounts for six elements: ecosystem service type, method, participation, biogeographical realm, waterbody type, and problem to solve. A Chi-square test was used to identify dependence between these elements. Studies involving the participation of stakeholder groups adopted an integrated approach to analysing sustainable water management, considering provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. However, such studies have been in decline since 2015, in favour of non-participatory studies that were strictly focused on ecological and provisioning issues. Although this reflects greater concern for the health of freshwater ecosystems, it is a long way removed from the essence of ecosystem services, which entails an integrated approach to the interrelationships between hydrology, landscapes, ecology, and humans.

AB Recent accelerated climate change has exacerbated existing environmental problems in the Mediterranean Basin that are caused by the combination of changes in land use, increasing pollution and declining biodiversity. For five broad and interconnected impact domains (water, ecosystems, food, health and security), current change and future scenarios consistently point to significant and increasing risks during the coming decades. Policies for the sustainable development of Mediterranean countries need to mitigate these risks and consider adaptation options, but currently lack adequate information - particularly for the most vulnerable southern Mediterranean societies, where fewer systematic observations schemes and impact models are based. A dedicated effort to synthesize existing scientific knowledge across disciplines is underway and aims to provide a better understanding of the combined risks posed.

TI Customisation of the decision support system MOIRA-PLUS for applications
   to the marine environment
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB The present short communication describes a technique to customise the decision system MOIRA-PLUS for applications to the marine environment. MOIRA-PLUS was originally designed to predict the behaviour of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in fresh water ecosystems and to evaluate the environmental, social and economic impacts of selected countermeasures aimed at restoring the polluted environment and at reducing the doses to man. An example of application for predicting the concentration of radiocaesium of Chernobyl origin in the Mediterranean Sea is described and discussed. The technique allows the user to easily integrate existing state-of-the-art box models of sea water circulation into the MOIRA-PLUS decision system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   abundance of microplastics in surface water from Ennore to Kovalam along
   the east coast of India
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB Microplastics, as growing contaminants in current scenario, are an ecological threat to the surface water ecosystem. Our primary goal is to investigate the identification, characterization, distribution and abundance of microplastics throughout India's east coast, from Ennore to Kovalam. In accordance with the NOAA protocol, microplastics were examined in surface water samples. At all sampling sites, polymers like polyethylene (43%), polypropylene (42%) and polystyrene (15%) were often found. Surface water (total sample location = 34) were found to be contaminated with various types of microplastics ranging from 6 to 30 items/Location with a mean value of 12 items/Location. Microplastics examined from surface water in a variety of colours, including white (26%), black (16%), grey (12%), red (14%), blue (12%), yellow (10%) and green (10%). Microplastics identified by stereo microscope as well as analytical methods such as SEM and FTIR were utilized to explore the charac-terization of microplastics. The following are the most typical types of microplastic found in surface water: Fibres (59%), films (24%), fragments (10%) and pellets (7%). This research work is a baseline for study about microplastics contamination site from Ennore to Kovalam on East Coast of India.

TI Screening of ecological impact assessment indicators in urban water body

SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Based on a river water environmental restoration project in a downtown area of the Taihu Lake Basin, this study continuously monitored the changes of water quality for two years using five indicators (shore and riparian plants, phytoplankton, amphibians, fish, and microorganisms). The variation characteristics of biological indicators were analysed over the urban water body restoration process. According to the results of water quality analysis, the water quality significantly improved during the restoration of the water environment (from inferior class V to V). With the improved water quality, the diversity of plants and amphibians changed little, which were characterized by single species and small quantities, without showing regular changes. The diversity of fish in 2015 increased significantly compared to that of 2014, and correlated significantly negatively with the concentration of water pollutants. Carps showed a stronger enrichment ability for Mn and Pb. Microbial count, gamma-proteobacteria, and proteobacteria collectively served as a definitive indicator of the degree of heavy pollution in water bodies. Indicators of the ecological impact assessment in the urban water body restoration process screened in this study can be used as indicative reference indicators for the restoration status of urban water ecosystems.

TI Picocystis salinarum (Chlorophyta) in saline lakes and hot springs of
   East Africa
SO PHYCOLOGIA
AB The occurrence of Picocystis salinarum in saline inland waters of East Africa was investigated using a polyphasie approach of small-subunit (SSU) rDNA phylogeny and light microscope observations. Recent studies have found that Picocystis occasionally replaces the dominant: cyanobacterium (Arthrospira fusiformis), which is the main:food resource of Lesser Flamingos, in soda lakes of Bogoria and Nakuru. This article discusses the consequences of a high abundance (maximum cell numbers of > 3 billion cells 1(-1)) of Picocystis on food chains of African saline waters. During the study, we found a new morphotype of Picocystis characterized, by larger cell sizes and absence of lobes in hot springs near Lake Magadi. SSU rRNA genes of Picocystis strains and uncultured field clones collected from Lake Nakuru Were subjected to phylogenetic analyses together with other picoplankton from field and culture samples from saline, marine or freshwater. Picocystis salinarum from saline inland waters represents a link between marine and freshwater habitats from both an ecological and a phylogenetic point of view and is therefore of great interest.

AB The Niger Delta is a 40-km(2) sedimentary basin with a complex river network and a fragile ecology in which fresh and saline water ecosystems maintain a dynamic equilibrium. Large-scale upstream impoundment in dams and reservoirs have over the years drastically reduced flow and sediment delivery to the coast resulting in adjustments to ecological boundaries, coastline geometry, lowered flood water levels and upstream migration of tidal influences. However, as the reservoirs get silted up, they no longer function as effective flow buffers, occasioning increased floods towards the pre-dam levels.

TI Application of agricultural pesticides in a peak period induces an
   abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a lake ecosystem
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The contamination of pesticides has been recognized as a major stressor in fresh water ecosystems in terms of the losses of services and population declines and extinctions. However, information on the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton communities under natural field conditions are still lacking, although zooplankton is quite sensitive to most of pesticides in laboratory studies. In this study, a natural lake ecosystem (Liangzi Lake) was used to determine the relationship between pesticide contamination and abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton. In August 2020, the comprehensive trophic level indexes and the abundance of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites of Liangzi Lake were comparable, but the abundance of metazoan zooplankton showed significant variations across two orders of magnitude. These results suggested that other factors, such as pesticide contamination, might be responsible for the variations of metazoan zooplankton community. Furthermore, the responsible pesticides were screened, and totally 29 pesticides were obtained. Finally, five pesticides were identified to provide more than 99.4% toxic contributions and chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were two main causal agents. These results were further supported by laboratory exposure experiments using D. magna and field study in November 2020, where the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were strongly decreased and the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was comparable across the 14 sites of Liangzi Lake. Taken together, this work provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural freshwater ecosystem.

AB Lakes play important roles in the economic-social sustainable development. However, due to unreasonable development and urbanization in recent years, lake water pollution and ecological degradation have occurred in China. The improvement of the lake inflow water quality is very important. A filtration system includes Gravel filtering system, Aquatic plant area and Ecological bag area was established. The test river is one of the typical lake inflow river and located in the river network in the Chang Dang lake, China. Water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton in the inflow river were observed form July to mid-August in order to analyze the general process. The average removal rate of NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen) TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total phosphorus) is 28.33, 25.76 and 24.43 %, respectively. The Pantle-Buck method was used to evaluate the water quality and the B/T index was used to evaluate the nutrition situation. The B/T values were reduced by 20% and the SI pollution index was reduced by 11.8 %. Therefore, a positive effect on the water's ecological restoration was achieved by the filtration system.

In the Iberian Peninsula so far, macroinvertebrate factors, usually used to assess and set water quality, have restricted applications to rivers since the behaviour of these factors does not give reliable conclusions in other water ecosystems (lakes, Shallow lakes, wetlands, etc.). The new ecological index presented in this work, called " Nutrition Mode Index" (IMN), aims to assess the quality of trophic structures of the macroinvertebrate communities in all the continental aquatic systems.

TI Alkali exposure induces autophagy through activation of the MAPKpathway
   by ROS and inhibition of mTOR in Eriocheir sinensis
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Saline-alkali water is widely distributed around the world, and salinization of water ecosystems has occurred in some areas of the world, comprising approximately one-third of the total land area, which has drawn much attention to the conservation of water ecosystems and aquatic animals. However, due to the complex compo-sition of saline-alkaline water, many aquatic animals are unable to survive, which greatly limits the development and utilization of saline-alkaline waters. Carbonate alkalinity is an important stress factor for aquatic animals in saline-alkaline water. Exposure to highly alkaline carbonate can induce oxidative stress. For this study, we used Eriocheir sinensis as a model organism to evaluate the effects of alkaline stress on oxidative stress and autophagy. The trial was divided into five alkali level treatment groups (control, 4.375 mmol/L, 8.75 mmol/L, 17.5 mmol/L, and 35 mmol/L, respectively), and liver tissues were assessed by antioxidant enzyme kits, real-time quantitative PCR assays and ultrastructural observations at 3 time points (24 h, 48 h, 96 h). Compared with the control group, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC)) in the alkali stress group increased and then decreased with increasing time, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased. At the molecular level, the expression of MAPK pathway-related genes (P38, MAPK, JNK) in the alkaline stress group showed a dose -dependent increase at 48 and 96 h and was significantly higher than that in the control group. The expression of autophagy-related genes (ATG5, ATG12, ATG7 and GABARAP) increased dose-dependently at 24, 48, and 96 h and was significantly higher than that in the control group. In contrast, mTOR expression was always in a suppressed state. These results suggest that alkaline stress induces activation of the MAPK pathway via ROS and inhibits mTOR expression, thereby inducing autophagy in the liver tissue of Eriocheir sinensis. This study investigated the stress mechanism of carbonate on Eriocheir sinensis and provided a theoretical basis for the continued exploitation of saline-alkaline water aquaculture.

AB Lyonnaise des Eaux (LE), is a leading private French environmental design and water resource management group employing over 110,000 staff with sales in excess of US$ 18 billion. LE has used artificial recharge (AR) techniques for more than 30 years in the Paris area.
   Artificial recharge applies in the two largest groundwater treatment plants in the Paris area: Croissy-sur-Seine (300,000 m(3) per day) and Flins-Aubergenville (150,000 m(3) per day). The recharge process has been in operation in Croissy-sur-Seine with infiltration basins since 1959, allowing a large number of quality, quantity and ecological surveys. The water is drawn from the Seine river and undergoes treatment processes including clarification, settling and sand filtration. It is then sent to 15 hectares (37 acres) of infiltration basins where it undergoes cascade aeration before gradually reaching the aquifer, Infiltration capacity ranges from 1 to 3 m per day, Altogether 54 million m(3) thus reach the aquifer every year.
   Through two real examples, the authors analyses the nature of the problem, the methodology and results obtained for groundwater resource management using AR techniques in the Paris area, They explain the site procedures, experimentation carried out and the numerical approach. A statement of the various surveys is proposed, which outlines the programmes carried out: hydrogeochemical survey, ecological survey, groundwater modelling, aquifer recharge optimization in term of quantity, quality (including microbiology and parasitology survey), age of the water and economic aspects.
   The experience gained over the past ten years has made it possible to develop innovative techniques to optimize management and maintenance of infiltration processes according to physicochemical and biological clogging phenomena. The authors also present the advantages and disadvantages of various recharge techniques using basins in the light of comprehensive water ecosystem management policies. Issues related to groundwater protection, intake maintenance, continuous water quality monitoring stations, alert systems and crisis management are also addressed.

AB Populations of fishes provide valuable services for billions of people, but face diverse and interacting threats that jeopardize their sustainability. Human population growth and intensifying resource use for food, water, energy and goods are compromising fish populations through a variety of mechanisms, including overfishing, habitat degradation and declines in water quality. The important challenges raised by these issues have been recognized and have led to considerable advances over past decades in managing and mitigating threats to fishes worldwide. In this review, we identify the major threats faced by fish populations alongside recent advances that are helping to address these issues. There are very significant efforts worldwide directed towards ensuring a sustainable future for the world's fishes and fisheries and those who rely on them. Although considerable challenges remain, by drawing attention to successful mitigation of threats to fish and fisheries we hope to provide the encouragement and direction that will allow these challenges to be overcome in the future.

TI Decomposition processes in coastal lagoons and their implications for
   the assessment of ecological health
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB Aside from structural indicators, functional indicators have been suggested as a tool for assessing the health of transitional water ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for the use of plant litter decomposition as a functional indicator of ecosystem health in coastal lagoons. A field experiment was conducted to assess the decomposition rate of Ruppia maritima enclosed in coarse and fine mesh litterbags and incubated in 10 Mediterranean coastal lagoons that conform to a gradient of ecological status produced by anthropogenic impacts as determined by a structural quality index. The microbial decomposition rate in fine mesh litterbags increased linearly along the ecological gradient. However, this relationship was not observed for the overall decomposition rate in coarse mesh bags. Decomposition rates in coarse mesh bags were negatively related to macroinvertebrate diversity, indicating that, in transitional habitats, such as coastal lagoons, high biodiversity is not a prerequisite for successful ecosystem functioning. The results suggest that functional indicators, such as the microbial litter decomposition process, should be used in addition to structural ones to detect anthropogenic-derived environmental perturbations in coastal lagoons.

TI The perception of water related risks and the state of the water
   environment in the European Union
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB In this work, we examine the factors predicting the perception of three distinct risks, namely "Algae growth", "Chemical pollution" and "Changes to ecosystems", to the water environment of each European Union Member State. We utilize a novel dataset that combines a Europe-wide Eurobarometer poll on water-related issues and a database of water quality indicators, water stressors and impacts compiled for the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). We utilize a three-level logistic regression model with the 2nd and 3rd levels being the region and the country in which the respondent lives. We find that perceived risks generally reflect the actual state of the environment at both the regional and national level, with the national level being stronger.

TI Exploiting the innate behaviour of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, to
   limit invasion and spawning in wetlands of the River Murray, Australia
SO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY
AB Common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., a destructive invasive pest of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, move from rivers into wetlands to spawn, making them vulnerable to trapping, but traps may also capture and affect access for native species. This study trialled a trap designed to separate carp from native fish entering wetlands by exploiting their different jumping and pushing behaviours. Trials were conducted at a flow-through wetland on the River Murray, South Australia, from June to October 2008. No carp approached the wetland inlet, but many (n = 3736) were sampled at the outlet, most by the trap (n = 2530), but there was some avoidance. Ninety-two percent of trapped carp were successfully isolated by jumping or pushing. Separation was most efficient (and avoidance least) when carp were ready to spawn (water temperature >16 degrees C). The outlet design substantially reduced wetland carp invasion, but more trials are needed to assess the pushing ability of native fish, to deter entry by turtles, and with alternatives for wetland inlets.

TI Particle-Size Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Urban
   Road Dust of Masan, Korea
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Concentrations and compositions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particle size fractions of road dust sampled from contrasting areas of an industrialised city in Korea are reported. The largest amounts of road dust were present in industrial areas, followed by areas subject to heavy traffic, and the lowest amounts were associated with a residential area. The highest concentrations of PAHs were recorded in road dust sampled from the areas with the heaviest traffic (0.45-4.1 mu g/g), followed by industrial areas (0.1-3.56 mu g/g), with the lowest concentrations associated with a residential area (0.32-1.95 mu g/g). PAH concentrations in the fractionated dust from the industrialised areas exhibited an inverse correlation with particle size. Although a similar general pattern was observed in the areas of heavy traffic, some increased concentrations associated with larger particles possibly reflect petrogenic contributions. Particles in road dusts from the residential area were generally smaller than those from the other areas, with PAH composition dominated by pyrogenic sources. PAH compositional profiles, evaluated through diagnostic isomeric ratios, indicate that exhaust emissions, rather than crankcase oils or tire and asphalt abrasion, are the major polluting source.

TI The effects of motorway runoff on freshwater ecosystems .3. Toxicant
   confirmation
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Previous studies have demonstrated that small streams receiving road runoff have reduced water and sediment quality. These changes in quality are associated with alterations in the structure and functioning of stream communities. Laboratory studies have indicated that the community changes are due to sediment-associated contaminants, and toxicant identification evaluations have shown that the major toxicants are contained probably in a fraction of sediment extract that contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The aim of the present study was to determine whether PAHs were indeed the major toxicants in sediment extracts. Toxicity tests were performed with PAH mixtures, the toxic fraction of an extract of runoff-contaminated sediment, and a whole sediment extract. These indicated that three PAHs accounted for the toxicity of a sediment extract: pyrene, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene. The possibility of spatial or temporal variation in major toxicants was also investigated and tests on a number of sediment extracts obtained from a number of sites at different times demonstrated that the three PAHs accounted for 30.8 to 120% of an extract's toxicity. When the PAHs were considered individually, pyrene was shown to account for most of the toxicity (44.9%), followed by fluoranthene (16%) and phenanthrene (3.5%).

SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB In the framework of an ecotoxicological approach to the processes of bioaccumulation and transfer of Hg in freshwater systems, we present a synthesis of our experimental studies concerning the interactions between inorganic Hg and MeHg and biological barriers:  - at organism and organ levels:  three biological models are selected:  fish (Salmo gairdneri), burrowing mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia rigida) and rooted macrophytes (Elodea densa, Ludwigia natans).  Results show strong specificities of the biological barriers (gills, intestine, roots, ...) towards metal fixation and absorption, closely related to the chemical form of the metal, the contamination sources (water, sediments or food) and the physico-chemical characteristics of the medium; - at cell and molecular levels:  biophysical study of Hg fixation on membrane reveals a new binding site on the phospholipids, the primary amine group on serine and ethanolamine polar heads, jointly with the SH groups of proteins; Hg(II) induces a strong rigidification of the phospholipidic bilayers.  Inorganic Hg and MeHg transports through model membranes (BLM) are essentially due to diffusion of neutral chloride species.  These interactions between Hg compounds and membranes are strongly dependent on Hg chemical speciation (pH and pCl effects).

TI PICOCYANOBACTERIA AND BACTERIA IN LAKE KINNERET
SO INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE
AB In Lake Kinneret, we have been monitoring the numbers and depth distributions of bacteria and picocyanobacteria since early 1988.  Picocyanobacteria were found throughout the year at all depths, at concentrations ranging from < 10(3) to 10(5) cells.ml-1.  Highest abundances were recorded during summer and fall in the epilimnion.  The lowest areal standing stocks occurred from March to May, the period which corresponds to the peak of the annual dinoflagellate bloom.  Bacterial numbers ranged from about 10(5) to 10(7) cells.ml-1.  The picocyanobacteria were evenly distributed in the water column during the mixed period.  With the onset of thermal stratification and the end of the dinoflagellate bloom the numbers of picocyanobacteria increased rapidly in the epilimnion.

TI Ecological environment health assessment of lake water ecosystem system
   based on simulated annealing-projection pursuit: A case study of plateau
   lake
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB A lake ecological environment health assessment index system is constructed based on DPSR (Driving forces -Pressure-State-Responses) framework. The simulated annealing projection pursuit (SA-PP) algorithm, which can analyze high-dimensional data, is introduced and provides a new way for lake ecological environment health evaluation and decision-making. Qionghai, a typical plateau lake in Sichuan, China, is taken as an example to introduce the application of this assessment system. The results suggest the water ecological environment of Qionghai basin is in a relatively healthy state from 2017 to 2020. The state subsystem has the largest weight, and the important influencing factors affecting the health of lake water ecological environment are the water environment characteristics, ecological characteristics and pressure subsystem in the State subsystem. Zooplankton Simpson diversity index, chlorophyll a, NH3-N and total nitrogen are the main influencing factors of lake ecosystem health in the lake ecosystem health system. The restriction factor of the pressure subsystem is per capita daily domestic water consumption. Therefore, improving water quality and controlling water consump-tion intensity become important factors to improve the health of water resources and water environment in Qionghai basin. This study provides a new way for lake ecological environment health evaluation and decision -making.

TI A Critical Review of Methods for Analyzing Freshwater Eutrophication
SO WATER
AB Water eutrophication is a global environmental problem that poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The evaluation of eutrophication provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the management and rehabilitation of water ecosystems. In the last four decades, dozens of evaluation methods have been applied to freshwater eutrophication, but there is a clear need to optimize and standardize the most suitable methods. We have addressed this gap by presenting a systematic review of methodologies. Due to the diversity and complexity of water bodies, no single evaluation method was identified that would adequately represent eutrophication under all scenarios. We demonstrate that lakes can best be assessed using the trophic level index (TLI) method, reservoirs and wetlands the trophic state index (TSI) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, respectively, and rivers the FCE method or back propagation (BP) neural network methods. More recently applied methodologies including spectral imaging and 3-D mapping of water quality using underwater gliders allow greater resolution and can be effective in managing waterbodies to avoid future eutrophication. The aim of this review is to guide future studies on the most appropriate methods available for assessing and reporting water eutrophication.

TI CONTROLLED VERSUS CONVENTIONAL DRAINAGE EFFECTS ON WATER-QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING-ASCE
CT National Irrigation and Drainage Conference
CY JUL, 1993
CL PARK CITY, UT
AB Fertilized cropland is a potential nonpoint source of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can contribute to the nutrient enrichment of surface water ecosystems. Research has shown that agricultural drainage water may contain fertilizer nutrients and pesticides. Nitrogen and phosphorus are present in drainage outflow primarily because of the addition of fertilizer, which results from the change in land use following drainage improvements instead of from the mere installation of drainage. Yet, public concern for the environment has led to a general criticism of agricultural drainage for degrading water quality. Controlled drainage has been recognized in some states as a best management practice to reduce the transport and delivery of nitrogen and phosphorus to sensitive surface waters. This article summarizes and compares water quality impact associated with conventional and controlled drainage practices. Nitrogen and phosphorus reductions of 30% to 50%, resulting from controlled drainage are reported in several studies. Several researchers believe further reductions are possible by carefully managing fertilization rates and timing to match crop uptake. Further minimization of the off-site impact of agricultural production will require a better understanding of the mechanisms of fate and transport of nutrients and pesticides and their interaction with drainage and other water-management alternatives such as controlled drainage.

AB In the present paper, sensor based on the integrated three-electrode screen-printed system with in situ plated lead film working electrode (SPCE/PbF) was fabricated, and its microscopic and electrochemical characteristics were investigated. For the first time, a new supporting electrolyte composition (CH3COONH4, CH3COOH and NH4Cl of pH = 5.9 +/- 0.1) has been proposed in order to improve electrochemical response of SPCE/PbF towardU(VI) determination. The differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetric (DPAdSV) signal of U(VI) increased linearly from 0.1 to 10 nmol L-1 with limit of detection of 0.019 nmol L-1 and sensitivity of 0.97 +/- 0.00015 mu A/nmol L-1. The applicability of the SPCE/PbF for trace concentrations of U(VI) in water samples with the use of resin in order minimalize the influence of organic matrix was successfully demonstrated.

These valued purposes are the consequence of the unique natural characteristics of ecological sensitive systems as rivers and lakes for the conservation of their fish fauna and their general ecological stability. In this study it was recorded the freshwater fish fauna of the main rivers and lakes in the Region of Thessaly (Greece) and was considered the current protection status for each fish species according to the EU Regulation for Ecotopes (92/43/EEC), the Berne Convention, the IUCN 'Red List' of threatened vertebrates, and the Greek Red Book of fresh water fishes. Then their threats were categorised and the proper management strategies and legislation needs for its protection were specified. The knowledge of environmental legislation, which regards the threatened fish fauna, constitutes a key parameter for biodiversity protection of environmentally sensitive inland water ecosystems such as rivers and lakes, aiming to their rational management and conservation.

SO LIMNETICA
AB Mediterranean shallow lakes are affected by many deterioration processes like eutrophication, land-use changes along its drainage basin and climate change. Aquatic plants are expected to reflect the ecological changes of shallow lakes since they are in close contact with the environmental factors. We assessed the influence of climate, land use and local conditions on macrophyte community changes in Sentiz Lake, a steppe water body located in the northwest of Spam, using long term data of local conditions, satellite imagery, orthophotography and climatic series. We found important changes in the environmental drivers of aquatic macrophyte assemblages (e. g. mean depth, water surface area, shore vegetation, mean annual temperature and grassland coverage). Similarly, we found that aquatic macrophyte growth forms responded to different environmental controlling factors: submerged and floating-leaved hydrophytes responded to local conditions, while big helophytes and small helophytes responded to land use and climate, respectively. Overall, our study suggests that management efforts aimed at preserving aquatic macrophyte assemblages of shallow Mediterranean lakes should focus not only on local conditions of each lake but also on their watersheds and climate. Therefore, this study improves the knowledge of the environmental drivers of aquatic macrophyte assemblages of shallow Mediterranean lakes, incorporating long term data of both physical and biological parameters and providing a basic framework for applying management and conservation strategies in these and other similar ecosystems.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Aquatic microbial diversity, composition, and dynamics play vital roles in sustaining water ecosystem functionality. Yet, there is still limited knowledge on bacterial seasonal dynamics in lotic environments. This study explores a temporal pattern of bacterial community structures in lotic freshwater over a 2-year period. The aquatic bacterial communities were assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Overall, the communities were dominated by alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia. The bacterial compositions varied substantially in response to seasonal changes (cold vs. warm), but they were rather stable within the same season. Furthermore, higher diversity was observed in cold seasons compared to warm periods. The combined seasonal-environmental impact of different physico-chemical parameters was assessed statistically, and temperature, suspended solids, and nitrogen were determined to be the primary abiotic factors shaping the temporal bacterial assemblages. This study enriches particular knowledge on the seasonal succession of the lotic freshwater bacteria.

Results demonstrated that the engineered strain had a high Cr (VI) reduction rate of up to 40% at a concentration of 50 mg/l after being cultured for 48 h. Additionally, the optimal culture conditions were pH 7.0 and 37 C. Furthermore, the carbon sources and metal cations exhibited significant effects on the Cr (VI) reduction rate of the engineered bacterium. Sodium lactate, sodium acetate, Cu2+, Co2+ and Pb2+ were positively correlated with the reduction rate. Chromate reductase was soluble and presented in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which was as an electron donor, reached 14.83 U/mg.

CT 11th International Symposium on Ecohydraulics
CY FEB 07-12, 2016
CL Melbourne, AUSTRALIA
AB Hydropeaking is one of the main environmental impacts on running water ecosystems in Austria. Many affected rivers have a poor ecological status. Habitats for fish and invertebrates can be reduced, abundances can be diminished and organisms are affected by drift and stranding during the increase and decrease phases of peaks. To assess the ecological impact of hydro peaking, intensity thresholds according to different species and life stages can be applied. However, due to retention effects, the hydrological impact is not constant in a longitudinal view. A model to assess hydrological impacts considering distances to the power plant outlets is needed. For this purpose, we developed a model by detecting fluctuation intensities out of multiple hydrographs along the affected river reaches. This forms the basis for describing potential effects of hydro peaking by contrasting the varying hydrological impact intensity to threshold values of river organisms. Furthermore, mitigation scenarios can be evaluated, both ecologically and economically, by modelling modified hydro peaking intensities.

This study was carried out in Aysen region, in southern Chile, and it included different kinds of water bodies such as rivers, streams, ponds, lagoons and lakes distributed along an altitudinal gradient at 46 S. It was found a low species number, essentially cladocerans, copepods and amphipods. A null model was applied in order to determine the existence of regulator factors of species associations, and the results revealed that they are not random. The patterns would be influenced by geographical and limnological characteristics of the studied sites. Our results would agree with regional studies on habitat heterogeneity such as in Torres del Paine National Park and other zones in Tierra del Fuego island.

AB A single stress, acidification with sulfuric acid, was applied to Little Rack Lake in a whole-ecosystem manipulation. We documented a wide range of responses to the acidification, including increases in the concentrations of various chemicals, shifts in microbial processes and a major increase in water clarity to UV-B radiation. Each of these changes could in itself be considered as a separate ecosystem stress that is distinct from the intended manipulation. Acidification in Little Rock Lake was accompanied by a number of substantial changes in the occurrence of organisms. A series of detailed investigations indicates that the mechanisms underlying these organismal changes are varied but cannot usually be tied to the direct effects of acidification. Overall, our results demonstrate how multiple stresses can arise from a single agent operating on an ecosystem and suggest that singly operating stresses may actually be quite rare.

AB Microatolls are massive corals on flat reefs with the colony dying in the center or there is a hole in the middle due to erosion by algae or other micro-borers. This study aims to measure the ability of UAV RGB imagery to identify micro atolls located on reef flats and objects associated with them on small islands. High resolution satellite images were also used to compare their accuracy in estimating the size of micro atolls. Some of the important steps carried out are field surveys, aerial and google earth photo acquisitions as well as mosaics, classification with segmentation based on, shape and color, texture, and shape of object proximity. RGB UAV is used to collect data and it is processed by object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification algorithm and supervised classification. This paper represents the result of UAV data analysis is more accurate and precise than high resolution satellite image data analysis. The diameter of the micro atoll can be calculated and the associated community around it. This technology allows it to be used for monitoring shallow water ecosystems bordering community activities on the mainland of small islands and producing a higher scale.

TI Hyperspectral analysis of algal biomass in northern lakes, Churchill,
   MB, Canada
SO ARCTIC SCIENCE
AB A hyperspectral approach to quantify algal biomass was studied across 30 shallow ponds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands near Churchill, MB. Normalized difference algal indices (NDAI) were calculated based on hyperspectral measurements of the reflectance collected on shore with a hand-held spectrometer in parallel to estimations of biomass with an in vivo fluorometer designed for benthic algae. Algal biomass and coarse assemblages were differentiated through their spectral reflectance as a demonstration of concept for future upscaling that would be necessary for regional monitoring using remote sensing technology. Results indicated strong agreements between the calculated NDAI for measured reflectance from each pond and that of the isolated benthic zone. Cyanobacteria were the dominant component of the algal community for most ponds. As such, measures of reflectance and use of simple NDAIs may be able to characterize the total biomass of northern ponds. However, the distinction between algal groups may require independent validation of algal assemblages for estimations beyond total biomass. Nonetheless, hyperspectral analysis could provide a strong potential for monitoring northern freshwater systems at a regional scale.

SO AMBIENTE Y DESAROLLO
AB Water macro-invertebrates are a well-known group in the flowing-water ecosystems, though they have been poorly studied in the lentic ecosystems. In Colombia, studies about the relationship between this group and the floating macrophyte roots are scarce. Therefore, this work aims to determine association between Eichhornia crassipes and the water macro-invertebrates, and their relationship to the physical-chemical variables such as the dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolve solids, alkalinity, transparency, copper, water temperature, free chlorine, total chlorine, swamp depth and macrophyte spreading in the Palagua swamp (Colombia). This way, 11.759 macro-invertebrates, belonging to 37 families, were recorded and Planorbidae and Cyclestheriidae were the most abundant. Regarding the physical-chemical parameters, alkalinity showed significant differences regarding the time, while only the macrophyte spreading showed differences regarding the space. In turn, the Spearman coefficient showed a significant but inverse correlation between the swamp depth and the dissolved oxygen. The canonic correspondence analysis indicates that alkalinity and swamp depth are the variables with the greatest influence on the macro-invertebrates. The family diversity reported in the study was high as compared to the data available in the literature.

SO RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
AB The present research is based on the annual Reviews of Environmental Conditions and Pollution in the Russian Federation and Yearbooks of Environmental Pollution in the Russian Federation for the period of 2006-2015. The parameters and estimates of abiotic environmental component (air, surface water, and soil) and radiation conditions are generalized from the data of the national observation system of environmental conditions (a base of the national system of environmental pollution monitoring in the Russian Federation) as well as from the data of local environmental observation systems. The results of the analysis of observational data and the conclusion on the conservation of high levels of air pollution in the cities and surface water pollution in many water bodies (including the assessment of priority of existing problems) are an important element of the informational support of state control of the sources of pollutant emissions (discharges) to the environment. The given information is also used for the comprehensive assessment of the influence of unfavorable environmental factors on the population health and terrestrial and water ecosystems. Besides, information on the dynamics and actual levels of environmental pollution allows assessing the efficiency of nature protection measures taking into account the observed trends and dynamics of variations.

SO PHYCOLOGIA
AB We describe Chloroparva pannonica Somogyi, Felfoldi & Voros gen. et sp. nov., a new trebouxiophycean picoplanktonic alga isolated from a turbid, shallow soda pan in Hungary. The cells are spherical to oval, less than 2 mu m in diameter, with simple ultrastructure typical to small green algae. Cells divide by autosporulation, forming two daughter cells per autosporangium. Cell wall structure consists of an outer trilaminar layer, an inner microfibrillar layer and an electron-transparent layer covering the plasma membrane. The trilaminar layer of the mother cell wall often persists around the autospores. Typical chlorophyte pigments have been found, including chlorophyll a and b and lutein as the dominant carotenoid. The main fatty acid was oleic acid. The phylogenetic position of the new chlorophyte confirms the proposal of a new genus within the Trebouxiophyceae. Based on its 18S rRNA gene sequence, this isolate is distantly related to Nannochloris eucaryotum UTEX 2502, Chlorella minutissima C-1.1.9 and C. minutissima SAG 1.80 (<= 97.6% 18S rRNA gene pairwise similarities).

TI Nutrient loading by anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus):
   contemporary patterns and predictions for restoration efforts
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Anadromous alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) have the potential to alter the nutrient budgets of coastal lakes as they migrate into freshwater as adults and to sea as juveniles. Alewife runs are generally a source of nutrients to the freshwater lakes in which they spawn, but juveniles may export more nutrients than adults import in newly restored populations. A healthy run of alewives in Connecticut imports substantial quantities of phosphorus; mortality of alewives contributes 0.68 g P.fish(-1), while surviving fish add 0.18 g P, 67% of which is excretion. Currently, alewives contribute 23% of the annual phosphorus load to Bride Lake, but this input was much greater historically, with larger runs of bigger fish contributing 2.5 times more phosphorus in the 1960s. A mesocosm experiment in a nearby lake showed that juvenile ale-wife growth is strongly density dependent, but early survival may be too low for juvenile outmigration to balance adult inputs. In eutrophic systems where nutrients are a concern, managers can limit nutrient loading by capping adult returns at a level where juvenile populations would not be suppressed.

TI Seasonal Activity Budget of Adult Baltic Ringed Seals
SO PLOS ONE
AB Although ringed seals are important components in oceanic and fresh water ecosystems at high latitudes, little is known about how they exploit these harsh environments. Seasonal activity and diving behaviour of 19 adult Baltic ringed seals were studied by satellite telemetry. We elaborated an activity budget for ten months of the year, extending over the period from moult to the breeding season. Seals from three main regions showed explicit site fidelity and the distributions of animals tagged from different areas did not overlap, suggesting separate stocks. Both the mean duration and the mean depth of dives peaked in June and July. Seals spent 70% (females) to 85% (males) of their time diving in June and July which decreased to 50% in late autumn. Less than one percent of dives exceeded 10 min in females, while 10% of male dives lasted longer than 10 min in June to September. Less than one percent of dives lasted for more than 25 min. Both females and males were most active during day time and hauled out predominantly during the night. Activity patterns during the summer are suggested to be correlated to energy accumulation and prey availability. The information on seasonal activity budget is crucial for developing population energetic models where interactions between ringed seals and other trophic levels can be evaluated.

TI Valuation of Hidden Water Ecosystem Services: The Replacement Cost of
   the Aquifer System in Central Mexico
SO WATER
AB This paper reports research estimating the costs of replacing the groundwater that the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Toluca, and Cuernavaca, in Central Mexico, pump from 10 over-exploited aquifers with 6 supply alternatives of surface water. These aquifers provide about 70% of the water required by more than 28 million people, and their recharge zones in forested areas are increasingly threatened by economic activities. By designing a constrained optimization program that minimizes investment and operation costs, we found that replacing groundwater extraction involves the construction of all six alternatives at an estimated cost of US$25 billion at present values (US$0.6 m(-3) over a 26-year period). We designed and analyzed a scenario to combine measures to reduce water leaks in Mexico City; a positive balance was found: every dollar invested in leak control reduces replacement costs by between US$1.9 and US$8.4. Therefore, our results suggest the prioritization of leak control measures in order to reduce extraction from over-exploited aquifers. Local authorities should be warned about the economics of losing ecosystem services that are crucial to sustaining the population and the economic activities in the region of study.

AB There is currently a global call for more use of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM), and ecosystem models such as Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) are being used to provide a holistic view of ecosystem-fisheries interactions. Although these can be useful for an EAFM, the relative paucity of data available for deep-sea ecosystems raises concerns whether we can effectively apply an EAFM to the deep sea. The deep-sea ecosystem off the west coast of Scotland has been studied for longer and in more detail than most. This study assimilates the significant published and unpublished information available on this ecosystem into an EwE model. The results suggest that there are sufficient data available to construct an ecosystem model, but the quality of the data varies and serious potential sources of error are present in biomass and discard estimates. The assumptions needed to produce a model are varied and must be considered when interpreting the outputs of the model. Ecosystem modelling provides a unique view of the deep-water ecosystem and facilitates hypothesis development concerning predator-prey and inter-fishery interactions. Sharks are used to illustrate the benefits of using an ecosystem model to describe changes in their biomass and their prey species. The results show that both fishing for sharks and fishing for their prey affect the biomass of sharks.

TI New sustainable Mannich-functionalized lignin flocculants for
   ultra-efficiently tailoring wastewater purification
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The complex pollutants in wastewater, especially the highly toxic and carcinogenic azo-dyes, seriously endanger the water ecosystem and human health. Using renewable lignin to develop efficient flocculants is of great significance to environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the preparation process of lignin-based flocculant is not only inefficient and cumbersome, but also brings serious pollution, making their development unsustainable. In this study, a new type of ultra-efficient Mannich-functionalized lignin-based flocculants was prepared by a simple, green strategy. Lignin-based flocculants were synthesized by copolymerizing lignin with acrylamide in a UV-induced aqueous copolymerization system and then modified by Mannich with formaldehyde and diethylenetriamine. Comprehensive considering the influence of molecular weight, charge density and amphiphilicity, herein, two different types of lignin-based flocculant (LBF1 and LBF2) could be precisely tuned by adjusting the dose of formaldehyde and diethylenetriamine. The results showed that the turbidity removal rate of LBF1 for kaolin suspension could be up to 99.31%, and the decolorization rate of Acid Black 1, Direct Red 80 and Reactive Red 2 solutions using LBF2 was more than 99.60%, which outperformed almost all other lignin-based flocculants reported in the previous reports. Moreover, LBF1 and LBF2 showed excellent resistance to the complex external environment, reflecting their outstanding universality.

AB Long-term continuous monitoring (LTCM) ofwater quality can bring far-reaching influences on water ecosystemsby providing spatiotemporal data sets of diverse parameters andenabling operation of water and wastewater treatment processes inan energy-saving and cost-effective manner. However, currentwater monitoring technologies are deficient for long-term accuracyin data collection and processing capability. Inadequate LTCMdata impedes water quality assessment and hinders the stake-holders and decision makers from foreseeing emerging problemsand executing efficient control methodologies. To tackle thischallenge, this review provides a forward-looking roadmaphighlighting vital innovations toward LTCM, and elaborates on the impacts of LTCM through a three-hierarchy perspective:data, parameters, and systems. First, we demonstrate the critical needs and challenges of LTCM in natural resource water, drinkingwater, and wastewater systems, and differentiate LTCM from existing short-term and discrete monitoring techniques. We thenelucidate three steps to achieve LTCM in water systems, consisting of data acquisition (water sensors), data processing (machinelearning algorithms), and data application (with modeling and process control as two examples). Finally, we explore futureopportunities of LTCM in four key domains, water, energy, sensing, and data, and underscore strategies to transfer scientific discoveries to general end-users

TI Water resource management and public preferences for water ecosystem
   services: A choice experiment approach for inland river basin management
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The concept of ecosystem services provides a valuable approach for linking humans and nature and for supporting the protection of natural ecosystems. River water services, which influence public health and daily routines, have both social and ecological benefits to a surrounding area. However, river networks and their services have suffered extensive destruction due to urbanization and industrialization, especially in China. An assessment of river system benefits and recognition of public preferences are crucial for sustainable river management and effective river system restoration. The objective of this study was to assess a household's willingness to pay using a choice experiment (CE) with mixed logit and multinomial logit models. This technique was applied to evaluate a respondent's preferences regarding water service attributes such as upper basin, middle basin and lower basin ecological water distribution; water quality; and payment and the possible source of heterogeneity in these attributes. The estimated likelihood ratio test demonstrated that random parameter logit model (RPL) models had considerably more explanatory power than multinomial logit (MNL) models. It was also revealed that the RPL-II model was the most powerful among all the models, demonstrating the capability of that model to predict the choices of the respondents. Furthermore, the findings show that water quality was the most preferred river attribute, and households were willing to pay more for the water quality attribute that derives the highest marginal value. Household income level, residential location, education level, and sex were the main factors influencing willingness to pay. These assessments provide guidance, policy recommendations and a reference for researchers and policy makers to improve and enhance current river water services in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Environmental flows in the Anthropocence: past progress and future
   prospects
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Human modification of the global hydrologic cycle through the building and operation of hundreds of thousands of dams and diversions has significantly altered fluvial processes, leading to impairment of river ecosystem function and biodiversity loss worldwide. The concept of environmental flows (e-flows) emerged to mitigate the undesirable hydrological impacts of dams and water diversions, in order to strengthen ecologically informed water management. In this paper, we outline the scientific foundations and progressive development of the current e-flows framework over the last 25 years, identifying three discrete periods in its history: emergence and synthesis, consolidation and expansion, and globalization. We highlight the evolving challenges and audiences that e-flows engages, and discuss the challenges facing the framework during the current period of rapid global change. For e-flows to contribute most effectively to sustainable freshwater management on a global scale, it must, first, move from a focus on restoration to one of adaptation to climate and other environmental change stressors, second, expand its scale from single sites to whole river basins, and third, broaden its audience to embrace socialecological sustainability that balances freshwater conservation needs with human well-being in both developing and developed economies alike.

SO MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB The EU Water Framework Directive is a Community legislative instrument in the field of environmental protection that establishes a common framework for keeping water quality at a favourable level. To implement the directive, classification systems need to be established that allow detection of human impacts at early stages and, thus, more effective management of coastal communities. Due to the spatial variability of communities, however, the results of any assessment are highly dependent on the selection of data. In this study we identified local spatial scales in which variability of macrophyte communities was maximised, quantified links between observed patterns of sediment types and communities and estimated how selection criteria impacted the outcome of the assessment of indicator class value in four different communities of the Northern Baltic Sea. The main findings of the study were that: (i) there were no clear local spatial scales in which the variability of benthic communities was maximised; (ii) hard-bottom communities were better predicted by the spatial arrangement of sediment characteristics than soft-bottom communities; (iii) the selection of method had no effect on the estimates of macrophyte cover and indicator class; but (iv) method impacted independently of habitat type on error estimates of macrophyte cover and indicator class. To conclude, in such homogeneous and low diversity macrophyte communities it is preferable to use methods that result in lower error estimates of algal coverage and, thus, result in lower uncertainties of estimates in the water quality class.
