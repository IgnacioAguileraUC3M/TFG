TI Configurations of progress and the historical trajectory of the future
   in African higher education
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB The role of African higher education institutions has been embedded within the socio-economic and historical contexts of the continent. Understanding the nature of African universities, their roles in African societies, and their place in the global knowledge system demands comprehensive reflection of the historical trajectories of the sector itself. In order to re-imagine the future of African higher education, it is important not only to reconstruct the past by uncovering facts but also to deconstruct it by challenging the nature of established truth on which historical evidences are created. This article challenges and deconstructs dominant narratives on the historical trajectories and configurations of progress in African higher education systems. The article provides a thorough analysis of major trends, developments and challenges that the sector has been facing through time with the intention of reimaging and constructing the notion of a new or alternative future that addresses the recurrent challenges of the sector. The notion of creating the new African university carries a fundamental inquiry asking: 'What it means to be an African university?' 'What role do they play in African societies?' and 'How do African institutions manage to strike a balance between the individual, social and corporate responsibilities interacting with their stakeholders?' This article interrogates the intricate pattern of interactions among African societies and higher education institutions, reflecting on historical trends and critical challenges facing the sector that have been negatively impacting the pace of realising the desired future.

TI Are South African doctoral qualifications educating the thinkers we
   need?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Significance: The recently completed national review of the doctoral qualifications offered by South African higher education institutions has provided important insights into the national landscape of doctoral education, and raised many questions. One key question is whether our doctoral qualifications educate our students to be the broad and critical thinkers needed to address current and future scientific and societal challenges. In the South African higher education context, we must ask ourselves whether we are providing the academic and intellectual depth required to enable our doctoral graduates to achieve the graduate attributes that we express as our national aspirations, and we need to consider new approaches to doctoral education.

TI Smash-and-grab, truth and dare ...
SO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION GAZETTE
AB In this article, we daringly advance a 'smash-and-grab' approach as a radical epistemic grounding for communication studies. We draw inspiration from African scholarship, legitimating the 'smashing and grabbing' of usable and valuable insights from anywhere while viably calling for the construction and elaboration of conceptual schema that are locally relevant. In this way, we seek to reclaim the common humanity of scholars and to counter the current insularity by which communication scholarship remains steeped in archaic, patriarchal, and decidedly racialised ideas of the West and the rest.

TI ASSESSING EVALUATION EDUCATION IN AFRICAN TERTIARY EDUCATION
   INSTITUTIONS: OPPORTUNITIES AND REFLECTIONS
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB The demand for knowledge from evaluations to inform evidence-based policy making continues to rise in Africa. Simultaneously, there is increased recognition of the role tertiary education institutions can play in strengthening evaluation practice through high quality evaluation education. This article investigates the status quo of evaluation education in selected tertiary institutions in Anglophone African countries. The article utilizes a mixed methods research methodology that blends secondary data review, an online survey using a structured questionnaire and two regional workshops. Data was collected from 12 Anglophone African tertiary education institutions. Findings indicate that evaluation education in Anglophone African tertiary institutions is mostly in the nascent stages and there are mixed feelings on the appropriate entry levels (undergraduate or postgraduate). The study highlights the need for developing a specialized evaluation curriculum as evaluation education still borrows from theories and methodologies from the North. Institutional, operational and policy-related challenges are highlighted as well as the potential for collaboration among various stakeholders in strengthening the design and implementation of evaluation education. Key tenets for strengthening evaluation education are highlighted and discussed.

   SIFE and Multilingual Learners
SO UNDERTAKING EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES IN THE 21ST CENTURY: RESEARCH FROM
   THE FIELD
SE Research on Education in Africa the Caribbean and the Middle East
AB The education of refugee and immigrant students is complex due to various factors that are critical and sometimes competing. The purpose of this chapter is to proride a forum through which scholars froth several African nations can discuss key issues surrounding the African refugee and immigrant new comer student within a historical perspective of the contemporary migration of Africans. This chapter explains the pull and push factors, and examines the nature of challenges and their impact on the overall educational experiences of the African immigrant and refugee children (and their families) in the Western New York region with emphasis on: a) historical perspective of the contemporary migration of Africans, particularly for refugee and immigrant children, b) the complexities of factors in educating them, and c) the possibilities that lay ahead. Drawing from recent research, conference and workshop surveys, and data based on on-going work by the African Educational Alliance in Buffalo-New York, the authors will highlight findings and raise questions for insights into the challenges and the collaborative effort to support the African child's education. The discussion draws front in-depth interviews, document analysis, and critical personal narratives.

TI Merging right: Questions of access and merit in South African higher
   education reform, 1994-2002
SO PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION
AB The dismantling of South Africa's apartheid-controlled education system after 1994 brought with it unprecedented policy complications, among them the question of how best to integrate the desiderata of access and merit in school education and tertiary sectors. For the higher education sector, institutional mergers became an increasingly visible policy tool with the advent of the Asmal Ministry in 1999. Mergers promise better quality programs with improved access, accelerated integration, and - most importantly - greater resource efficiency. The fact that mergers played an initially muted role in South African education policy and planning is due in large part, I argue, to the failure of an anticipated "massification" in the late 90's. This unexpected result forced out the need for a quick and decisive economic streamlining of the higher education system. As before, the goals of merit and access were energetically proclaimed. Now, however the driving principle seemed increasingly to be one of demand-side cost efficiency. This reshuffling of the policy deck tells us something important about the respective stages of education policy, planning, and implementation, but also provides a link between post-apartheid school education and tertiary reform in the Republic. Both higher education mergers and school education local control measures enact a form of "centralized decentralization." Policymakers concentrate power all the more effectively by appearing to share its benefits among all relevant stakeholders in matters of equity and merit for South African education.

TI TOWARDS RELEVANT THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN AFRICA: COMPARING THE
   INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSE WITH CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGES
SO ACTA THEOLOGICA
AB During the past five decades the heartland of global Christianity has shifted to the Southern hemisphere. This places the responsibility of future Christianity predominantly in the hands of church leaders in these regions. It is therefore crucial to critically reflect on how effective theological education is to produce competent church leaders, especially in Africa. This article aims to give an overview of the challenges theological education in Africa is currently facing, and then to provide a macro vision of the major moments in the development of the international discourse on theological education over the past five decades. This comparison will inform practitioners about the relevance of current models used for theological education in Africa. By highlighting the relevance of these various models and how they relate to challenges in Africa, this article contributes to research on the development of new and alternative frameworks for theological education in an African context.

TI In pursuit of African scholarship: unpacking engagement
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Engagement between higher education and other societal sectors is a key theme in higher education discourse in South Africa, as it is in other countries. In South Africa, however, engagement has gained additional status as an appropriate strategy for pursuing African Scholarship. On the ground, however, inequitable power relationships and erratic participation have posed serious challenges to the effectiveness and sustainability of engagement initiatives. From the experiences of seven South African academics and the local community members and service-providers with whom they engaged in service-learning, three factors emerged as mediating the power/participation dynamic of their engagement. The impact of these factors, namely, structure, meaning, and place and time, are discussed, leading to the conclusions that scholarly engagement requires ideological and practical support from higher education institutions and further study in South African contexts.

TI The effect of the ideology of new managerial professionalism on the
   South African education system
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB If the intention of South African education legislation is to professionalise teachers, and if this is seen as empowering them for their task, connected to quality education, then it is indeed a worthy ideal. However, pedagogical values have been redefined within a neoliberalist framework, serving corporate culture and lowering the pedagogical role of teachers to a position of obedience to market norms. In the attempts of professionalising teachers, education has fallen prey to an ideology of new managerial professionalism - the worthy ideal of professionalising teachers has become a mechanism for dominating the very people it set out to liberate. Within the context of a growing global economy the pedagogical values that embody the professionalisation of teachers have been replaced by values aligned with economic growth. The professional role of the teacher and educational reform has been driven by a political ideology committed to new managerial professionalism. The paper highlights the way in which an overemphasis of the professional status of teachers within a neoliberalist framework establishes and sustains relations of domination in South African education. The effects of new managerial professionalism on education are also explored.

TI Beyond Reforms: The Politics of Higher Education Transformation in
   Africa
SO AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW
AB In spite of over a half century of interventions and waves of "reforms," higher education in Africa today consists of institutions, systems, and practices that lack distinct values and goals, or a mission and vision connecting them to the major challenges of their local and global contexts. What is needed in African higher education is true transformation, which will involve practical and epistemological ruptures with previous ways of doing things and a reconstruction of structures, relations, cultures, and institutions. Of particular importance are initiatives that will ensure gender equity, changes in the organization and process of knowledge production, and a reenvisioning of universities' funding sources and mechanisms.

TI African Studies Keyword: Body
SO AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW
AB The human body is a central entity and analytic within African life and Africanist scholarship. The source of perception and the seat of animation, of life, it grounds experience of the world while also providing a rich set of symbols from which humans draw in political, social, and religious life to create and communicate meaning. Livingston reviews approaches to the body as a key concept in Africanist scholarship, tracing regimes of bodily representation ranging from the deployment of bodily symbolism in ancient smelting furnaces to the hypervisibility of the black female body in the European colonial imagination. She discusses a welter of bodily experience, from the pain of childbirth and the vulnerabilities of illness and accident to the sensorium or the kinesthetic power of movement and dance. In the process, Livingston considers developments within the field of African Studies via the body.

TI Offerings of Women in the Transformation of African Higher Education: A
   Retrospective Overview
SO EDUCATION AND URBAN SOCIETY
AB This article presents an unusual concrete insight to African higher education transformation. The purpose is to examine the roles of African women mainly Charlotte Maxeke, a South African, in the transformation of higher education and to identify the legacy these transformation offerings translate into for women. It is organized as follows: first, the origin of transformation in higher education systems to global massification of education in the background section is traced. Second, in an attempt to understand as a means of examining the roles of women in the transformation of higher education, existing literature as evidence is engaged. Two crucial issues-challenges for African higher education transformation and women's role in higher education development in Africa-were reviewed analytically toward transformation of higher education. Third, empowerment theory, as suitable theory for the reasonable accomplishment of the purpose of this article, is presented. Last, the theory was applied to the discussions justifying the conclusion. The methodology used is both descriptive and exploratory. The article divulges that women had always being fanatical about empowerment of themselves and others because women had at some points in history contributed to developmental alterations of African higher education given their enormous offerings or contributions. Obviously, as revealed in this article, while risking their lives in an Apartheid/colonial regime where death could visit anyone who opposes the government at any time, their offerings or roles include financial commitment; empowerment advocacy and knowledge enchanting.

TI Markets, equity and democracy - Structural adjustment and the tensions
   of educational change in South Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB In 1994 South Africa embarked on a process of major reform of an education system that had existed to support and maintain apartheid. Two of the key principles behind these reforms were greater equity and democracy. However, although not formally having a structural adjustment policy, since 1994 the South African government has had close ties with the World Bank and has increasingly adopted the type of free market macro-economic policies that it favours. This article examines tensions in South African educational policy caused by existing policies favouring state initiated redistribution of resources and power on the one hand and the wider context of a mounting emphasis on limiting public expenditure and increasing private provision on the other. It concludes by asking whether South African education would benefit by borrowing from the World Bank to invest in human resources and argues that the potential dangers outweigh the potential benefits.

TI The didactics tradition in South Africa: a reply to Richard Kruger
SO JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES
AB There has been a growing interest in the European Didaktik tradition as part of a process of 'internationalizing' curriculum studies. Kruger provides useful insights into some aspects of Didaktiek in South Africa. However, the essay does not contextualize this tradition within the broader history of South African education. This reply contends that Didaktiek was interwoven with 'fundamental pedagogics' and as a consequence played a role in reproducing apartheid ideologyit did not provide a language of critique or possibility. This is one reason why the tradition has seen its demise in post-apartheid South Africa. I argue that curriculum theory, which crucially deals with the relationship between schooling and society and highlights the socially constructed nature of schooling, offers a more useful alternative for critiquing apartheid education policy and for charting a process of transformation of education in South Africa.

TI Teaching and learning through multiple intelligences in the
   outcomes-based education classroom
SO AFRICA EDUCATION REVIEW
AB As outcomes-based education forms the foundation of the new school curriculum in South Africa, educators are confronted with the challenge of not only meeting the different needs of individual learners, but also of helping learners (many of them previously disadvantaged) to achieve their maximum potential. One way of realising this ideal is by applying Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences in the classroom. The article provides a discussion on both Gardner's multiple intelligences theory and outcomes-based education in South Africa, as it is believed that together they can contribute to solving some of the present problems in South African education. The article defines the use of MI theory in an OBE classroom and suggests specific ways in which educators worldwide could incorporate the different intelligences in their teaching and learning activities.

TI Gazing at South African higher education transformation through the
   potential role of the Wesleyan quadrilateral: A theological approach
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB The 2015-2016 South African higher education student movements evoked critical conversations regarding the extent to which institutions of higher learning have transformed into democratic and inclusive spaces. One of the key gaps in this field is the paucity of research that explores the potential role of theology in steering the direction of transformation in South African higher education system. Through a Wesleyan approach, the paper argues that the four quadrilaterals of the Wesleyn approach, scripture, tradition, reason and experience will be used as a theological tool to weight beliefs in the levels of dogma and doctrine, opinion and so as not to confuse critical reflection with negativity and judgmentalism in critically reflecting on the South African higher education struggles for transformation and decolonization. In our attempt to contribute meaningfully to the broader debates, started by scholars such as Nadar and Reddy (2015) and more recently, Phiri and Nadar (2018), who locate their work in theology to think through gender, curriculum and African feminism differently, counter-hegemonically. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this emerging body of work by arguing that theology has a critical role to play in helping us to imagine what a transformed, inclusive and socially just higher education could look like.

TI Opening and transforming South African education
SO OPEN LEARNING
AB This article examines the challenge of opening and transforming South African education. 'Openness' and 'transformation' of any education programme in any society are ethicopolitical processes. In the case of South Africa, the transition from an autocratic education system serving the interests of a minority to a more modern and democratic educational dispensation demands a critical rethinking of the meaning of these twin concepts of openness and transformation. The policy of outcomes-based education (OBE) has been used as a strategy for educational change. This article argues that, although OBE can be understood in the context of the desire for change, the programme's implementation does not lead to radical opening and qualitative transformation of the South African educational sector. Any pedagogy of radical empowerment through political and deliberate advocacy policies needs to take into consideration the content of the new system of education, the professional quality of the educators, and the calibre of the new learners.

TI DR. ANDREW FOSTER: A LITERATURE REVIEW
SO AMERICAN ANNALS OF THE DEAF
AB OFTEN COMPARED to Laurent Clerc, Thomas Gallaudet, and Alexander Graham Bell, Dr. Andrew Foster was a deaf African American who founded 32 schools for the deaf in 13 African nations. The 60th anniversary of his arrival in Liberia and Ghana and the 30th anniversary of his tragic death in a Rwanda airplane accident both occur in 2017. Renewed interest in Foster has spawned research and events to reexamine questions about his contributions to the expansion of deaf education in Africa. However, none of these activities have taken a full biographical approach. More in-depth, historical, and biographical research is needed to answer the many remaining questions about Foster's life and legacy. A literature review was conducted to investigate what are considered Foster's key contributions and the factors that might have motivated him to expand access to deaf education in Africa.

TI African Cultural Education and Schooling: towards Bicultural Competence
   of African Australian Youth
SO AUSTRALASIAN REVIEW OF AFRICAN STUDIES
AB This article explores the concept of African Cultural Education Program (ACEP) as a relevant tool for gaining bicultural competence among African migrant descendant youth in Australia. The article proposes that acquisition of biculturally informative knowledge may be facilitated by critical exploration of diverse 'funds of knowledge' associated with the cultural experience and identities of the African Australian youth. ACEP is a Third Space phenomenon through which diverse 'funds of knowledge' may be explored, critically, towards a positively selfaffirming discourse. The article proposes that formal schooling of African Australians should be complimented by an African Cultural Education Program (ACEP). Such a program involves cultural translators as agents for facilitating dialogue about cultural identity and schooling towards bicultural competence.

TI Language and social justice in South Africa's higher education: insights
   from a South African university
SO LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION
AB The paper interrogates the issue of language and social justice in South Africa's higher education using quantitative and qualitative data collected at the University of the Free State (UFS). Data were collected using questionnaires. Through purposive sampling based on South African and UFS demographics, 120 questionnaires were administered to UFS students. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The results show that language is a critical component in the conceptualisation and actualisation of social justice in South Africa's higher education. The results further indicate that language continues to play the role of privileging access to higher education for some, while curtailing access to higher education for others, in South Africa. The paper concludes that this reality is contrary to the principles of social justice and recommends a radical overhaul of the language dispensation in South Africa's higher education within the framework of social justice.

TI Fragmented Soft Power: Bureaucratic Politics and China's Foreign Aid in
   Education to Africa
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA
AB Whilst China's increasing foreign aid in education to Africa, its soft power remains insufficient. 'Telling China's story well' attributes the lack of soft power to inadequate communication. This article argues that the 'story' rather than 'telling' matters. It reveals that the education-for-economic development paradigm adopted by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Education's reluctance toward Africa jointly shape China's ineffective practice in the international discourse. Institutional changes since 2018 can hardly alter this bureaucratic divide as the imbalanced capacity of China's economy and education remains. This article contributes to bureaucratic politics in foreign policymaking by identifying ministerial influences subject to their relevance to foreign policy rather than their occupancy of resources in the issue area.

TI Race-Positive Career and Technical Education: Techno-Social Agency
   Beyond the Vocational-Liberal Divide
SO TECHTRENDS
AB In the United States, the history of African American education has long referenced the Booker T. Washington-W.E.B. DuBois debate that put vocational or technical education and liberal education in opposition to each other in the goals for racial uplift. Today there is good reason to be skeptical of centering vocational training in African American education given that racially marginalized students are often regulated to vocational settings that reinforce class stratification. However, our research on broadening the participation of African American children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) illuminates a much more dynamic image of career and technical education (CTE) than is sometimes assumed. Using a racepositive framework, we show how CTE can be a generative site for moving beyond the liberal-technical dichotomy. We find that race-positive CTE is feasible when teachers seek to flatten hierarchies between the vocational and the liberal in education.

TI Evaluation roots reconsidered: Asa Hilliard, a fallen hero in the
   "Nobody Knows My Name" project, and African educational excellence
SO REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Asa Hilliard has left his mark, and his name belongs in the pantheon of esteemed African American scholars, educational researchers, teachers, and activists. Although his work has served as a clarion call for an Afrocentric orientation in psychology and education to address the needs of African American students, his contributions to the field's thinking about educational evaluation date back 30 years and have seldom if ever been noted. For nearly three quarters of a century, issues of fairness and equity have guided and driven the work of African American scholars in educational evaluation. These issues remain uppermost in their minds today): as they investigate society's woefully inadequate schools for children from racial minority and/or poor backgrounds. It is within this space that this discourse links the legacy of African American educational researchers and evaluators during the pre-Brown era to Hilliard's later contributions to the field's thinking about educational evaluation.

TI Forgotten voices of Black educators: Critical race perspectives on the
   implementation of a desegregation plan
SO EDUCATIONAL POLICY
AB The conceptualization and implementation of desegregation educational policies are incomplete when they ignore the voices of Black educators. Through in-depth interviews with 21 African American educators in St. Louis, this article highlights how elements of what is being defined today as critical race theory were embedded in these educators' analyses of a 1983 court settlement that resulted in a 16-year desegregation plan. Through rich and detailed accounts, these educators illustrate how the desegregation plan ultimately protected the overall interests of Whites. Their analyses of the plan-seemingly pessimistic-were realistic. The ending of the plan in 1999 continued to place the onus on Black people to rectify the inequitable education in the city. Suggested is the need for courts and policy makers to begin listening to the voices of African American educators when framing educational policies' in tent on improving the education of African American students.

TI The Interplay between South African Higher Education Context and
   Academic Development
SO ANTHROPOLOGIST
AB The design and implementation of pragmatic teaching and learning agenda is fundamental for universities to attain their vision, mission and strategic objectives/plans. It is within this background that this concept paper examines the interplay between the South African Higher Education context and academic development principally at a formerly disadvantaged Black South African university. This concept paper draws predominantly from the review of South African higher education landscape and academic development related literature since 1994, the year in which a democratically elected South African government assumed office. The organisational and analytical framework underpinning this concept paper is informed by the social realist concepts of structure, culture and agency. The concept paper proceeds by discussing the impact of South African Higher Education context on the institution, students and academic staff, the way academic development is conceptualized and structured at the university before concluding and making recommendations. It emerges that the structures of the university need be in place and functional so that different agential roles can be executed amidst several constrains and enablements. The importance of the role of the Centre for Higher Education and other structures in nurturing a culture that enhances the production of graduates with attributes required by the world of business came to the fore.

TI The effect of African leaders' foreign education/training on the
   completion of primary education in their countries
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB The quest for the determinants of education in Africa has paid little attention to the role of political leaders; many of whom once received foreign scholarships. This article aims to examine the effect they have on education. We assume that foreign training encompasses factors guiding the choice of economic policies. The results of the estimation using fixed effect, random effect, generalized least square and Driscoll-Kraay methods on a sample of 219 leaders from 1975 to 2015 reveal that western and other African countries educated leaders negatively affect primary completion; the result is robust in autocracies. Studying abroad deprives leaders from their home country realities and orients them towards foreign policies.

TI A 'Quality Revolution' Constrained? A Critical Reflection on Quality
   Assurance Methodology from the South African Higher Education Context
SO QUALITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB This paper attempts a brief meta-reflection on quality assurance policy and practice in South African higher education, with a focus on methodology. More specifically it seeks to answer the question 'What are the effects of the Higher Education Quality Committee's (HEQC) quality assurance technologies on institutional practice and how could they be more effective in achieving its mandate?' This question is pursued with regard to the failure of the quality assurance system to impact significantly on the graduation rates of African South African students, despite the South African government's (and thus the HEQC's) explicit 'transformation agenda' for higher education.

TI BALANCING ECONOMIC AND OTHER DISCOURSES IN THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF
   HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB Since the end of the apartheid era in South Africa, "internationalization" of higher education has been a popular theme as the country takes its place as a regional leader in education and research in sub-Saharan Africa. However, competing discourses of internationalization have produced economic and moral dilemmas rather than the realization of philanthropic academic aims. The process of internationalizing higher education in South Africa has been greatly compromised by under-funding and overcrowding of post-secondary education institutions in the country.

TI A Coat of Many Colours: A Critical Race Theory Analysis of Language Uses
   at Two South African Higher Education Institutions
SO JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE IDENTITY AND EDUCATION
AB Many African higher education entrants have an African language as a first language, whereas English and Afrikaans are default media of instruction in South African higher education institutions (HEIs). This precludes equivalent chances of academic success for students. Linguistic diversity in HEIs might also influence students' experiences in these institutions. This paper explores the perspectives of undergraduate students at a historically Black higher education institution (HBHEI) and a historically White higher education institution (HWHEI), regarding language use at these institutions and their accompanying experiences. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with 31 students and analysed the data using thematic analysis. We adopted a critical race theory lens to interpret participants' perspectives. We found enduring marginalisation of African languages, as informed by structural dynamics, and its detrimental effects on students' academic prospects and experiences, contrasting with the enduring privileging of English and Afrikaans in higher education.

TI Changing the geography of apartheid education in South Africa
SO GEOGRAPHY
AB The South African education system in the late 1990s is still trying to come to terms with the deep spatial and social divisions engendered by the apartheid past. School curricula have traditionally been devised at the centre with little collaboration from the practitioners in schools. With the end of apartheid, an attempt is being made to redress past imbalances and introduce a radically new curriculum. At present it seems that the position of geography in the new curriculum structure is somewhat precarious. However it is suggested here that geographical education has a key role to play in the 'new' South Africa.

AB Foreign investment can play an imperative role in education. As part of the research in understanding foreign investment in education in Africa and to demonstrate the inequalities that persist in the developing countries, the paper closely examined the model adopted by Oprah Winfrey at her Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls (OWLAG) in South Africa. The research on OWLAG directed us to examine private school versus public schools models in an African context. Both models in this paper are presented respectively and we propose a leadership academy for primary education in Africa. The academy will focus on learners at grade 0 to 6 and will turn gifted African girls and boys into innovative learners with new thinking. The focus will be on historically disadvantaged families as we believe that education is a basic essential service to these families. Apart from the curriculum, this initiative will create an appetite for Information and Communication Technology software in the education sector in Africa through socio-economic investments of various stakeholders as strategic assets. Finally, the paper presents the academy business model that will promote alternative revenue streams and the creation of strategic assets.

   PRESENT, AND POST-2015
SO POST-EDUCATION-FOR-ALL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM: STRUCTURAL
   CHANGES WITH DIVERSIFYING ACTORS AND NORMS
SE International Perspectives on Education and Society
AB This chapter aims to investigate and interpret China's educational aid by analyzing its history, philosophies, and practices in Africa. The study is based on review and analysis of governmental documents, reports, academic papers, and news by Chinese and foreign scholars on China's aid, particularly educational aid to Africa. The analysis unveils three transformations of Chind.c aid "from pro-ideology to de-ideology," "from single area to multiple areas," and 'from pragmatic economy driven to sustainable and humane economy focused" in Africa. Meanwhile, it indicates a continuity of the philosophy of solidarity, morality, and reciprocity in China's South-South cooperation with African educational development.
   The analysis also shows China's educational aid does not match well with the framework of the Western donors. China, under the FOCAC framework, is devoted to higher education cooperation, human resources training program, scholarship, and Chinese language education with African partners. With the growth of its economic and political influence, China will play multiple roles as the biggest developing country and as an active promoter and provider for South-South cooperation in the negotiation and construction of the post-2015 agenda. Nevertheless, we assume China will keep a pragmatic higher education cooperation with its developing country partners to inclusively link it with business, technology transfer, and people-to-people exchange.
   This study delivers a comprehensive review and analysis of paradigm shift, philosophy, mechanism, and practice of China's educational aid to Africa to fill up the literature gap in this field. It also timely presents China's stance toward discussion on the post-2015 agenda.

TI Making the invisible, visible: disability in South African distance

SO DISTANCE EDUCATION
AB Distance education celebrates its humanitarian mission of providing opportunities for disadvantaged and marginalized individuals who do not have access to traditional campus-based higher education. Large enrolments of students necessitate an industrialized approach in planning, design, and delivery informed by a normative assumption of ableism. In the context of post-apartheid South Africa, distance education fulfills a particular important role in ensuring access to education for all. This scoping review addressed two questions: "What is currently known, in the context of distance education in South Africa, about the educational experiences of SWDs?" and "How should we understand and respond to these experiences?" The scoping study shows, inter alia, that while there is an institutional commitment to providing equitable learning experiences, the lived experiences of students with disabilities provide evidence of their invisibility in the design, planning, and delivery of learning. The study concludes with some recommendations and provocations.

SO INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT
AB Cloud computing is a relatively new concept that holds significant promises for the future development and delivery of computer resources to secondary or basic education in South Africa, especially in schools most affected by the digital divide. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the extent to which cloud computing applications and services currently used by secondary education systems in developed countries around the world can be used to help breach the digital divide that currently exists in the secondary (basic) education sector in South Africa. The authors believe that South Africa has the required technology and skills to bridge the digital divide in secondary education and by doing so set the pace for the rest of the African continent. All it lacks is the political will and determination to do so.

It outlines briefly the ways in which social inclusion and exclusion were constructed under apartheid, and the ways in which these are redefined and reconfigured in the post-apartheid South African context. Using this as background, the article then looks at schooling in South Africa currently It outlines major educational policies and laws that have been promulgated since the transition to non-racialism and democracy in South Africa, and emergent trends and patterns within the educational and training system.

TI Social determinants for HIV prevalence among South African educators
SO AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
AB HIV prevalence among women in South Africa continues to be high despite the availability of a comprehensive plan for the control of HIV/AIDS and a plethora of prevention programmes. Any explanation for the ongoing high HIV prevalence continues to be elusive. The objective of this study was to understand the relationship between HIV, gender, race and socioeconomic status among South African public sector educators in order to inform prevention programmes. A cross-sectional survey involving a probability sample of 1,766 schools out of 26,713 in the Department of Education Register of School Needs was selected. A sample of 24,200 respondents out of 356,749 public sector educators participated in the study. Nurses registered with the South African Nursing Council were recruited, trained to conduct interviews and to collect specimens for HIV testing. The study found an association between HIV, gender, race and socioeconomic status among educators. African educators showed a higher HIV prevalence than other race groups. Among females, the highest HIV prevalence was among educators aged 25-35 years and in males aged 36-49 years. Further, educators with a high income and educational qualifications had a lower HIV prevalence compared to educators with low income and low educational qualifications, regardless of sex. Migration and marital factors were also found to play a role in HIV infection. The results suggest that HIV prevention needs to take into account critical issues around empowerment of vulnerable groups such as women and certain race groups to be able to implement safe sexual practices and therefore reduce HIV infections.

TI Moments Of Dislocation: Reflections on the Colonial Vestiges Embedded in
   African Higher Education
SO AFRICA EDUCATION REVIEW
AB Africans have exhibited tremendous resilience, coping abilities, and strategies to survive in multiple spaces globally despite the tensions and challenges associated with the Euro-colonial enterprise. However, the charge to liberate the African mind remains unabated and requires the unpacking of the complexities of the colonial schema, to advance African agency. The colonial is alive and a lack of scrutiny frustrates an understanding of its nuances and the guises in which it manifests, causing the colonised to perpetuate its plans in ignorance. The article presents selected areas where Africans have been de-centred in consciousness. Termed "moments of dislocation," these areas are historical, linguistic, inferiorisation of the African being, and journey to the West. Although these themes may not be exhaustive, they offer a path to instigate or sustain conversations about the insidious effects of the colonial, and potentially inculcated into discourses and praxis towards mental liberation. Identifying these disorders contributes to the comprehension of coloniality of knowledge, schooling, power, and being. Through critical African education, these concepts would receive unremitting scrutiny for African agency.

AB This paper investigates the claims of action research as an appropriate research methodology for investigating West African education. It suggests that since action research is sensitive to context and is directly relevant to practitioners. it might avoid some of the criticisms that have been levelled at some other methodologies. However, data from Ghana are used to problematize this position. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways in which collaboration between academics and teachers, based on action research, might develop so that both useful knowledge about education in West Africa is derived and practice is improved.

TI Examining the impact of HIV&AIDS on South African educators
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB Our aim in this study was to examine the impact of HIV&AIDS on South African educators. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in public schools combining HIV testing and a face-to-face interview with participants from a nationally representative sample of public educators. The results show that HIV is highly prevalent among South African public educators (12.7%) and the educators who are absent from school for longer periods (20 days or more) compared with those who are absent for less than four days have higher HIV prevalence (16.8% vs 11.95%). Educators also spend time away from teaching while they attend funerals for colleagues who have died (6.7%),for family members (13.4%) and for members of their communities (47.6%). This makes them feel depressed (71%). These results suggest that HIV&AIDS has an impact on the quality of education. There is a need to prevent new HIV infections and reduce morbidity through the implementation of comprehensive integrated prevention and treatment programmes targeted at educators. There is also a need to support educators in coping with the problem of HIV&AIDS at work and in the community.

TI Ethnic Studies: An Urgent Need in Theological Education in Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION
AB By virtue of its subject matter, theological education ought to infuse life with morals and values, thus moulding a just, moral and peaceful society such as is envisaged in God's telos for His world. And in line with its aims, theological education provides knowledge and skills to people to enable them to serve the church, together with the wider society where the church lives. A theological curriculum appropriate to its context ensures success in both these aspects of theological education. To their credit Africa's theological institutions seem to have curricula which are relevant to Africa's context. Success in sustaining the relevance of these curricula lies in continually revising the curriculum so that it does not become dated. One such urgent revision is in the offering of ethnic studies which is necessitated by the ethnic crisis in Africa. For this reason, ethnic studies in the curriculum of theological education in Africa are imperative. In the essay four ways are proposed in which ethnic studies could be included in the curriculum of theological education in Africa.

TI Africanisation of Legal Education Programmes: The need for Comparative
   African Legal Studies
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Debates and discussions about the African renaissance and the Africanisation of universities have raged for decades. The goal of developing an emancipatory Afrocentric system that frees African education from the continuous and dominant influence of Euro-and American-centric cultural values remains a challenge. This is particularly so with respect to conventional African legal training and research programmes. Some African legal scholars, sometimes imbued with xenophilia, have in many ways participated in the process that has seen the continuous marginalisation of studies on the law in Africa and African law. This paper argues that there is a need to rethink the place devoted to the study of African law and African legal systems. It contends that African law generally and African legal systems specifically will hardly be able to develop when present-day students spend most of their time, especially in a course such as comparative law, studying western legal systems. In order for African legal education to be relevant and meaningful it must prepare and equip today's lawyers to operate in a global world. It is therefore suggested that an Africanised legal programme should include a course on African legal studies and aim to be contextually and globally relevant whilst being sufficiently innovative and flexible to address the urgent needs of our times.

TI THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF THE SOUTHERN BIBLE INSTITUTE: A POST-SECONDARY
   SCHOOL OF BIBLICAL STUDIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS
SO CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB The United States of America has a long history in higher education, but one area of its history not exhausted through research involves higher education for African Americans. Specifically, higher education for African Americans in the area of theology or biblical studies presents numerous opportunities for further research. Soon after the enslaved African Americans were freed in 1863 as a result of signing the Emancipation Proclamation, the government provided land grants through the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890, for the establishment of public institutions of higher education for White and African Americans. AfricanAmerican ministers recognized the need to formally study the Bible. Segregation in the South prevented African-American ministers the opportunity to attend White seminaries. As a result, many African-American ministers spent time studying the Bible in small-group settings. In some instances, educated African-American ministers spent time teaching the uneducated ministers. Even though these ministers were creative in their pursuit of education, there was still a need to establish a formal institute to train African Americans in the exposition of the Bible. In Texas, this need resulted in the establishment in 1927 of Dallas Colored Bible Institute, known today as Southern Bible Institute. The purpose of Southern Bible Institute is to train African-American men and women in the scriptures. The institution realizes the need for pastors, missionaries, and Sunday school teachers to understand the Bible to effectively minister.

The South African Education White Paper (1997) and the National Plan for Higher Education (2001) are very specific when it comes to the role that higher education institutions should play in the development of communities and as a result contribute to wellbeing of the nation. The article is based on a case study of the Community Development Programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The importance of the management of community involvement through various sources at the university is the main focus. The distinctive advantages of having the infrastructure at the university are critically looked at.

SO AFRICA TODAY
AB This paper argues that the World Bank's economic cost-benefit methodology used in assessing primary education projects in Africa is largely ineffective in determining the Likely success and impact of these projects on their host countries. After analyzing the actual methods used, this study argues that to determine the net social value of primary education projects in Africa, the World Bank must reduce its dependence on traditional quantitative measures and incorporate a more pedagogical and sociological methodology combined with specific goals and increased field monitoring and assessment. The analysis ends with recommendations for methodological alterations and suggested means of offsetting additional costs.

TI STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES' EXPERIENCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN HIGHER EDUCATION
   - A SYNTHESIS OF LITERATURE
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB This review article offers a synthesis of published studies on students with disabilities' experience in South African higher education since 1994, when a democratically elected government took office. The article presents a review of published studies describing the experiences of students with disabilities in South African higher education (SAHE) in the period 1994-2017. A synthesis of the findings and implications of South African studies relating to students with disabilities in SAHE is provided. Three aspects will be discussed: (a) conceptualisation of disability; (b) access, inclusion and participation in higher education; and (c) supporting mechanisms for students with disabilities. Challenges, areas needing further study, lessons learnt, approaches and policy implications for policy-practitioners and institutions are suggested.

TI RACE, CULTURE, AND THE EDUCATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS
SO EDUCATIONAL THEORY
AB In this essay, Marvin Lynn explores a range of perspectives on African American education, with particular focus on three works: Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, by social anthropologist John Ogbu; African-Centered Pedagogy: Developing Schools of Achievement for African American Children, by teacher education expert Peter Murrell; and African American Literacies, by Elaine Richardson, professor of English and applied linguistics. Lynn draws on Charles Valentine's sociological framework for understanding culture in order to interrogate how the concept of culture is used in these works. Lynn concludes that critical race theory in education - a rapidly emerging discourse on schooling and inequality - may be a useful tool for lucidly framing the conditions under which African Americans are educated as well as the possible solutions to the perennial problems faced by this historically marginalized group.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the experiences of women of colour in South African doctoral education programmes. Through qualitative interviews with African, Indian, and Coloured female doctoral students, this study illuminates the challenges women of colour doctoral students face in progressing through doctoral education in South Africa, and the supports they utilize to help them persist and complete doctoral degrees. Findings are organized around four themes: (1) challenging race and gender stereotypes and expectations; (2) balancing multiple roles; (3) managing financial concerns and access to resources; and (4) finding support and encouragement. This study holds implications for how institutions of higher education can help support female students of colour in navigating their programmes.

TI Connectivism in Learning Activity Design: Implications for
   Pedagogically-Based Technology Adoption in African Higher Education
   Contexts
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING
AB This paper examines the possible characteristics and the value of designing learning activities grounded in connectivism-an emerging learning theory. It is an exploratory attempt to connect the theory to the prevailing technology adoption archetypes used in African contexts with the aim of extracting influences that could shape pedagogical technology adoption in African higher education contexts. A reflection on the process of designing learning activities that employ blogging in an experimental training intervention provides a unique context in which to try and infuse connectivist principles while outlining the challenges that surface. The questions driving the argument in this paper include: What do connectivist perspectives offer learning activity design and practice? What can the prevailing technology adoption models used in African contexts offer to learning activity design? Can we combine connectivist perspectives and African-based technology adoption models to inform pedagogical technology adoption in African higher education contexts? These questions are exploratory and are based on one single subjective experience of the author. They are part of an argument put forward as a proposal which is yet to be tested in practice.

TI Challenges Facing Physiotherapy Education in Africa
SO INTERNET JOURNAL OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES AND PRACTICE
AB Health care is changing and the demands put on health professionals are increasing. Physiotherapy education should reflect the health and social priorities of the nation. The World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) is committed to assisting physiotherapy associations in developing educational standards. Physiotherapy education in Africa however, seems to have a real need for assistance from the WCPT. The aim of this paper is to highlight the challenges facing physiotherapy education in Africa. The Delphi methodology was used to obtain information from key informants involved in the area of physiotherapy education from a variety of African countries. The majority of the participants were people who have experienced physiotherapy education in Africa either as graduates or current teachers. Data were analyzed into themes and sent back to respondents for confirmation. The most important challenges highlighted were: lack of undergraduate training opportunities, limited number of therapists, upgrading of physiotherapy educators, research as a major component of physiotherapy education, and recognition of physiotherapy as an essential service. It is concluded that assistance is needed for physiotherapists from Africa to take their rightful place in the health team and higher education institutions should look at improving diploma qualifications of physiotherapists in African countries.

TI Examining Life-Course Socioeconomic Position, Contextualized Stress, and
   Depression among Well-Educated African-American Pregnant Women
SO WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
AB Purpose: This article explores how childhood and adulthood socioeconomic position (SEP) and socioeconomic mobility, as indicators of life-course experiences, impact the relationship between contextualized stress and depression among well-educated, pregnant African-American women.
   Methods: The Jackson, Hogue, Phillips Contextualized Stress Measure and the Beck Depression Inventory were administered to 101 well-educated, pregnant African-American women during their first and second trimesters. Bivariate associations and regression analysis were conducted to assess life-course SEP, mobility, and contextualized stress as predictors of depression. Based on the demographic data for childhood and adult SES, the SEP and mobility variables were created.
   Results: Results from x(2) analysis revealed that high contextual stress was significantly associated with no change in mobility, that is, staying the same. Results from regression models found that contextualized stress was the only predictor for depression. Additionally, life-course SEP and mobility did not moderate the relationship between contextualized stress and depression.
   Conclusions: Our findings illuminated the persistence of racial and gendered stress as risk factors for depression among well-educated, pregnant African-American women, regardless of life-course SEP. We offer an explanation as to why African-American women who possess the material and social resources thought to mediate psychosocial and pregnancy risks remain in jeopardy.

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
AB Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have helped revitalize science education in South Africa and breach the iron control exercised over Black education by the apartheid government. Yet, back in the early 1970s NGOs in science education did not exist. This article is based on the story of one such NGO and the role it played in reconceptualizing science education in South Africa. It describes how the Science Education Project (SEP) confronted authoritarian practices not only of government departments of education but also within its own ranks. It concludes by suggesting that a way can be found whereby science education can become the Trojan horse of any authoritarian system. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons.

AB The development of ability fur technology and invention is required as self-sustaining growth of science and technology in Asian and African developing countries. Science education that connects to the real world is the required education for the self-sustaining growth. But in fact, it is very common to study for the entrance examination. According to C. Camilla,S. and Sjoberg, [The Re-emergence of Values in the Science Curriculum. Rotterdam, 2007, Sense Publishers], Ugandan students are the most interested ones in science and technology (I would like to be a scientist, I would like to get a job in technology) in the world. Science education should mortgages future of youth. Especially science education of developing countries should be directly connected to the real world. Because they need a lot of engineers as skilled worker, we implemented physics education that was directly connected with manufacturing by the sci-edu. support project in Uganda. The best results were achieved by contrivance in spite of poverty area. Our education method gave one form of New Science Education in Asia and Africa.

TI The South African Education Agenda: Identifying Markers for Rewriting
   Agricultural Extension Curricula
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
AB Changes in education and agriculture in South Africa indicate that agricultural extension practitioners should facilitate continuous learning among farmers. This requires that extension practitioners acquire new skills. To provide these skills requires a critical examination of agricultural extension curricula in the light of South Africa's educational, agricultural and rural development policies with a view to rewriting extension curricula. An initial theoretical examination of extension education in the light of South African education policy yields seven learning outcome indicators encapsulating theory and practice in: 1) theory and practice in problem solving; 2) collect, analyse, organize and critically evaluate information relevant to his extension responsibilities; 3) theory and practice in Participatory Technology Development and innovation; 4) theory and practice in systems (systems thinking), including beyond farm systems; 5) theory and practice in learning facilitation; 6) theory and practice in participatory 'curriculum' (extension outcomes, content and process) development; and 7) theory and practice in learning and learning styles. Tertiary institutions and other stakeholders can use these indicators to examine and continuously adjust curricula to ensure extension practitioners are equipped to deliver relevant support to farmers as the agricultural landscape changes.

TI Students' Engagement with Engagement: The Case of Teacher Education
   Students in Higher Education in South Africa
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
AB Public engagement is one of the three legs which support and underpin a restructured and transformed post-apartheid higher education system in South Africa (along with teaching and research). This third sector role of higher education is widely implemented in South Africa and is described differently by different institutions and entails a diverse range of activities, which include service learning. In the South African context we argue that building our understanding of the meanings of public engagement through engagement is vital. In this paper we explore teacher education students' engagement with service learning as a form of public engagement in higher education in South Africa.

TI The emergence of an education policy dispositif in South Africa: An
   analysis of educational discourses associated with the fourth industrial
   revolution
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
CT 7th Annual Conference of the South-African-Research-Association (SAERA)
CY 2019
CL Durban, SOUTH AFRICA
SP S African Res Assoc
AB The notion of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has recently entered the public and policy domain in South Africa. It has rapidly found resonance in policy discourse and the popular media. It has also entered the language of educational policy and institutions. The impact of 4IR on educational thinking and practice has hitherto not featured in academic discussion on education in South Africa except for a keynote plenary session at the annual conference of the South African Education Research Association (SAERA) in Durban (October 2019). The South African Education Deans Forum recently published a call for the submission of chapters for a book on teacher education, 4IR, and decolonisation.
   In this article, I develop an address that I delivered at the SAERA 2019 conference as part of the plenary panel. The article consists of four sections. The first offers a consideration of the entry of 4IR discourse into the educational imaginary. I suggest in this section that 4IR discourse has installed a socio-technical imaginary in South Africa's unequal educational dispensation. The second section concentrates on the construction of educational governance. Based on research on 4IR-related policy making, I discuss the policy directions taken by the Department of Higher Education and Training and the Department of Basic Education in giving effect to ways of engaging with 4IR in each of their domains. The third section features a discussion of the impact of technological disruption on society, the economy and education. The final section presents a discussion of the emerging educational architectures in the 4IR and a critical consideration of the curriculum and pedagogical dimensions of 4IR, which, I argue, are informed by an orientation that prioritises the acquisition of generic skills. Sidelining knowledge and concepts as central to the structuring of the curriculum, a generic skills approach succumbs to what might be called a knowledge blindness that holds pernicious consequences for epistemic access in South Africa.

TI Race-ing through the school day: African American educators' experiences
   with race and racism in schools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES IN EDUCATION
AB This article examines the ways African American educators experience themselves as raced individuals in their school settings and explores their perceptions of racial discrimination, subordination, and isolation. For this study, five African American educators participated in in-depth phenomenological interviews. Qualitative data analysis of their stories revealed seven major thematic experiences: (1) hypervisibility/invisibility; (2) intersecting identities; (3) challenging assumptions; (4) challenges to authority; (5) pigeonholing; (6) presumptions of failure; and (7) coping fatigue. The study confirms several tenets of critical race theory including the assertion that racism is not aberrant, but endemic and permanent in American society, and routinely exists in public schools. The study further suggests that those most directly positioned to bring about necessary, concrete change aimed at addressing racial discrimination and prejudice in schools are building-level administrators.

TI Theological education and the COVID-19 pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa: A
   Malawian perspective
SO IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a unique disruptive moment of unprecedented proportions in world history affecting all spheres of life. Theological education in Malawi, Sub-Saharan Africa, has not been spared in experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study argues that the effectiveness of theological education in Africa contributes towards the future of Christianity on the continent, because it serves as a foundation for a vibrant missional church. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for creativity and innovation which could ensure the survival and sustainability of theological education in Africa. It is therefore crucial to critically reflect on how the provision of theological education in Malawi in particular, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, in general, can be sustained during the uncertain and challenging times when the COVID-19 pandemic is devastating the African continent and the entire world. This article investigated the challenges and opportunities for theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In view of this, the following five objectives emerged: (1) to evaluate the Malawi government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) to discuss the history and importance of theological education in Africa; (3) to examine the challenges of theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) to assess the prospects of theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative research methodology was used, namely a literature review and interviews with members of the faculty of theological institutions in Malawi. Six main findings were established: First, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented both challenges and opportunities for theological education in Africa. Second, the effectiveness of theological education in Africa has contributed towards the future of Christianity on the continent. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the dominant models of theological education in Africa. This entails a shift from face-to-face teaching to online teaching and learning. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for the sustainability of theological education in Africa. Fifth, theological education has encountered misleading theologies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixth, theological education has the opportunity of constructing life-giving theologies in Africa. This study has two implications: (1) navigating the changing terrain of theological education in Malawi; and (2) theological education's employment of digital technologies during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Contribution: This study has contributed to the discourse of theological education in Africa by providing solutions to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Prostate Cancer Education in African American Barbershops: Baseline
   Client Survey Results and Differences in Decisional Conflict and Stage
   of Decision Making
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MENS HEALTH
AB There have been very few studies to rigorously evaluate the potential of African American barbers to educate men about prostate cancer in the barbershop setting. This research brief presents baseline data from a cross-sectional survey identifying differences in decisional conflict and stage of decision making by screening status from an efficacy trial to educate African American men about informed decision making for prostate cancer screening. Those men who had already received the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test were more advanced in their stage of decision making and had less decisional conflict about the PSA test than those men who had never received a PSA test. Educational interventions to increase informed decision making with prostate cancer screening must consider previous PSA test history as a mediating variable affecting decision self-efficacy.

TI Love and Justice: African American Women, Education, and Protest in
   Antebellum New England
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
AB African Americans who pursued higher education in antebellum America often faced harassment and violence. Historians link the struggle over African American education with broader protest strategies, with African American men taking center stage. This essay enlarges the narrative on African American education and social protest by examining how young African American women students contested racism and white supremacy. Focusing on the controversy that surrounded the first high school for young African American women in New England, this essay argues that young African American women deployed an ethic of Christian love as a form of social protest. These women named racial prejudice as anti-Christian while also advocating for a just and loving nation inclusive of African Americans. Though white opposition eventually shuttered the school, this essay shows how African American women's activism in the antebellum era is part of a longer genealogy of social protest.

TI Lifelong learning as cruel optimism: Considering the discourses of
   lifelong learning and techno-solutionism in South African education
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB This article seeks to examine how two discourses -of lifelong learning and techno-solutionism - tangle with each other in South African education policy imaginaries, particularly the latter discourse as a response to an (arguably manufactured) frame of "crisis". The author suggests that the discourse of lifelong learning constructs a relation of what Lauren Berlant terms "cruel optimism" for the marginalised majority of South Africans, sustaining a fantasy of liberatory education despite empirical evidence to the contrary. First, the prevalence of this discourse in key policy texts (predominantly education policy white papers) is examined, along with how both instrumentalist and humanist framings of lifelong learning promote and sustain this relation in spite of the ordinariness of the "attrition of the subject" (in Berlant's terms) as a defining experience of everyday life. Next, the ubiquitous frame of crisis in education analysis in South Africa is considered, along with techno-solutionism (a term coined by Evgeny Morozov in 2013) as a popular response amongst the dominant middle-class minority. The article suggests that cruel optimism is sustained for this middle-class group through techno-solutionist education utopias, as what Berlant terms a "redefinitional strategy" for manufacturing ahistorical moments of agency in the face of persistent structural issues centuries in the making. The lens of cruel optimism is thus offered as a mechanism for denaturalising the political work of both discourses, a necessary (albeit insufficient) move towards better grasping the nature of South African education concerns, as well as theories of change that might offer genuinely emancipatory learning for all.

SO CRITICAL ISSUES IN SOUTH AFRICAN EDUCATION: Illumination from
   International Comparative Perspectives from the BRICS Countries
SE BRICS Education
AB This chapter uses the two models of Wolhuter (2014b) and Wolhuter and Van der Walt (2018) to analyse and identify the weak places in the South African education system at primary and secondary levels, and the analysis of Wolhuter (2012) for identifying critical shortcomings at the level of higher education in South Africa. The model for the assessment of a national education project revolves around three dimensions of education, namely, the quantitative dimension, education quality and equality in education; whilst the latter is built on the roles or functions of a university in society, namely, teaching and learning at the cutting edge of science, service, innovation, preservation and development of culture and societal critique. It is concluded that the most critical problems in South African education relate to the issue of language of learning and teaching, accommodation of diversity, early childhood education, having education in tandem with the world of work, and, at the level of higher education, securing the establishment and maintenance of world-class universities. The chapter concludes with suggesting the international comparative method, and the Brazilian, Russian, Indian, China, South African countries as tertium comparationis for the illumination of these critical issues, thus setting a prospectus for the remainder of the book of which this chapter is the opening chapter.

TI The Enduring Relevance of Indigenisation in African Social Work: A
   Critical Reflection on ASWEA's Legacy
SO ETHICS AND SOCIAL WELFARE
AB Following the independence of many African countries in the 1960s, social work educators in Africa sought to depart from their 'Western' traditions and develop approaches to professional teaching and practice appropriate to the African postcolonial context. The Association for Social Work Education in Africa (ASWEA) led these endeavours between 1971 and 1989. This article narrates the journey of ASWEA through its documented history now made accessible as an online archive. Included is a discussion of the political agenda of ASWEA within the context of broader political movements at the time of its inception, when the debate on the 'indigenisation of social work education and practice' in Africa was just beginning. The article argues that to date, 'indigenisation' remains an ethical imperative for social work in Africa as it continues to seek locally relevant solutions to changing social problems.

SO REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
AB For the last two decades, the published research on the history of education of African Americans in the south during the era of de jure segregation has shifted from a focus on the inequalities experienced by segregated schools to understanding the kind of education African American teachers, principals, and parents attempted to provide under externally restrictive circumstances. This review provides a synthesis of this line of research. Results indicate that exemplary teachers, the curriculum and extracurricular activities, parental involvement, and the leadership of school principals were critical characteristics influencing the communities' perceptions of the schools. Additional research is needed that will explore student outcomes, variance within the characteristics, and external influences.

TI Towards a Humanising Pedagogy through an Engagement with the
   Social-Subjective in Educational Theorising in South Africa
SO EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH FOR SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This article is an attempt to bring the social complexity of education into a conversation with what is referred to as a humanising pedagogy. In the article, I work with a definition of humanising pedagogy based on a three-dimensional conception of social justice. Drawing on Nancy Fraser (2009), I suggest that such a pedagogy should involve 1) the question of knowledge redistribution, 2) recognition of the knowledges, literacies, and identities of students, and 3) an emphasis on participation that brings process pedagogical orientations back into view to counter the rigid pedagogical orientation that informs South Africa's curriculum approach. The article unpacks what it means to insert a conception of the social subjective into educational theorising in South African education academic work. I argue that this dimension is largely absent in hegemonic educational academic orientations, the consequence of which is a thinned-out focus on curriculum and pedagogy, devoid of how the complex social subjective frames the subject's access to education. Based on my ethnographic work in urban sites, the article offers a view of the social subjective that is aimed at disrupting South African educational theorising and provides a "pedagogical justice" view of education that may, conceptually, be able to account for the complex social subjective in education and thereby better enable the emergence of a humanising pedagogy in our educational discourses.

TI Special challenges in mathematics education in Sub Sahara Africa
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB Educational difficulties in mathematics education in Africa are diverse. Research shows that the challenges experienced in mathematics education are a by-product of those in education in general, and these span from policy, curriculum, instruction, learning, and information technology to infrastructure. Earlier commissioned studies by the World Bank revealed that there is a growing recognition that countries in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 48) need to improve their performance in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects if they were to grasp their full latent potential in a competitive global market that is increasingly shaped by the new technologically dependent world order. This study endeavors to document recently identified special challenges in mathematics education in Africa revealed in research over the past two years. Fifty-eight articles were reviewed, of which seven papers provide annotation of major findings of outstanding interest.

AB This historical multi-case study uses the concepts of coloniality of knowledge, critical hybridity, and indigeneity in examining higher education development in Africa through the efforts of Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, two educational reformers and former international students in the USA. We develop a framework for examining how transnational interactions between the Global North and the Global South shape higher education development. Implications are presented for the importance of flexible theoretical understandings of transnational higher education interactions as well as higher education practices in international student and scholar exchange and other transnational higher education engagement.

TI Impediments in promoting the functional status of African languages in
   higher education
SO SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB This paper seeks to provide an analysis of obstacles that hinder progress in promoting the functional status of African languages in the South African higher education sector. African languages suffer marginalisation despite the existence of various empowering and restorative legislative provisions and policies. In this study, we argue that African languages have a central role in driving the transformation agenda in the South African higher education sector. In particular, marginalising African languages has disastrous implications for the achievement of social justice and cohesion, and the access to and success of indigenous African language-speaking students. A language management approach was adopted as a foregrounding theory for this paper. A language planning and policy framework was also employed as a complementary theory. The study is based on data collected through semi-structured interviews with academics in the college of humanities at a university in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The study revealed a number of challenges, ranging from negative linguistic ideologies, orthography, weak bilingualism, among other factors. In rising to these pertinent challenges, higher education institutions need therefore to consider language management strategies designed to address language problems, particularly in multilingual contexts.

TI The transformation of music education: A South African case study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION
AB In this paper I reflect on transformation in South African education policy, post-1994. The new curriculum for schools was underpinned by the democratic values of the constitution and was a time of renewal for music education. However, over time as the original curriculum documents were revised, the focus of promoting indigenous traditions was abandoned and replaced by an overtly Western approach to music education. It is against this background that I also reflect on the transformation that occurred as a result of a continuing professional development programme that arose from a need to improve curriculum implementation in the arts.

As it appears, African leadership is still tied to European-centered frameworks that are counterproductive to the sacred existence of African peoples. Rarely does good news come from Africa; there are consistent problematic situations in self-governance. This article proposes proactive African-centered educational programs that could produce nationalistic and patriotic leadership willing to tackle Africa's endemic problems.

TI The Multiliteracies Learning Environment as Decolonial Nexus: Designing
   for Decolonial Teaching in a Literacies Course at a South African
   University
SO SCRUTINY2-ISSUES IN ENGLISH STUDIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB In higher education institutions in South Africa, educators working in the fields of language and academic literacy need to be sensitive and responsive to the linguistic and cultural diversity of the student body, and traditional pedagogical approaches are often inappropriate to meet the needs of students and of the wider call to decolonise higher education. As a group of lecturers working at the University of the Witwatersrand's School of Education in Johannesburg, South Africa, we worked to respond to this context by designing a literacies course that was underpinned by a decolonial and social practices approach to literacy. Using critical reflection as a research method, this article traces our theoretical grounding in designing this course, including New Literacies Studies (NLS), community cultural wealth, and theories in indigenous studies, such as cultural interface theory. This article further demonstrates how we applied this theoretical framework through introducing practical activities that could be used to develop situated literacies and that tapped into the community cultural wealth that students bring to the classroom. We discuss four formative and summative assessment elements that were central to the course, namely online assessments, portfolio tasks, an argumentative essay, and what we termed the triad project, to illustrate how the decolonial approach informed our curriculum design and pedagogy. Our approach allowed us to explore new forms of assessment which opened space for students' home languages, literacy practices, and identities to become valuable elements of teaching and learning.

TI No longer overlooked and undervalued? The evolving dynamics of
   endogenous educational research in sub-Saharan Africa
SO HARVARD EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
AB Multilateral donors like the World. Bank and bilateral agencies such as the United. States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the British Department for International Development exert a great, deal of influence in international educational development-particularly in sub-Saharan Africa-both in the programs they fund and the types of research they engage in. In. this article, Richard Maclure investigates educational research in Africa and juxtaposes research done by large, exogenous, Western, results-oriented organizations with research performed, by smaller, endogenous, local researchers aided by local research networks. Maclure argues convincingly that research that falls into the exogenous "donor-control" paradigm far too often is irrelevant to the African educational policy context and does little to develop local research capacity. The cases of two African research networks-the Educational Research Network of West and Central Africa and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa-are presented as exemplars of organizations that promote an alternative type of research that is endogenous, relevant to policy and the process of policymaking, and controlled by Africans. Maclure concludes with a call for increased support for and development of these types of networks, and for the development of the long-term solution to educational research in Africa-the university.

SO JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION
AB In the past few decades, scholars, activists, ann Educators have called for the development and utilization of African American-based theories and models of education. With the exception of Afrocentric education, little has been done to develop educational and theoretical models or strategies that address the historical and contemporary conditions of African Americans. By examining the educational thought of W. E. B. DuBois and extrapolating from his work a model of 6 educational principles, this article's purpose is to raise awareness of the need for African American-based education and encourage the further examination and development of African and American-based educational models.

TI Student mobility and doctoral education in South Africa
SO PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION
AB This article analyses doctoral education programmes in South Africa with a particular focus on student mobility. It investigates pull and push factors as a conceptual framework, arguing that the patterns of student mobility in doctoral education programmes in South Africa follow the patterns of international student mobility elsewhere, which are driven mainly by the quest for better opportunities. Contrary to previous studies, which do not focus on the role of the state, this article sees the state as playing a key role in facilitating such mobility. This article uses comparative education methods to compare the patterns of enrolment of doctoral education students in South Africa during 2005 and 2009. Statistical data from the Department of Higher Education and Training were used to analyse the enrolment patterns of doctoral students in South African universities. Secondary sources in the form of government documents, a literature review and internet sources were employed in contextualising the study.

TI RETHINKING INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN AN AFRICAN CONTEXT
SO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN AFRICAN CONTEXTS: A CRITICAL READER
SE Anti-Colonial Educational Perspectives for Transformative Change
AB Influenced by Paulo Freire's idea of critical pedagogy, this chapter argues for new ways of thinking about Inclusive Education in African contexts. This is so because of the complexity of the subject within the African schools. Inclusive Education challenges the practice in the whole schooling system, particularly the traditional way of teaching. It calls for the new and innovative ways of teaching and learning which take into account of the diversity of learners in the classroom. Learners with profound learning disabilities should not be discriminated. Teachers are expected have to develop intervention strategies that will cater for all learners including the ones with profound learning disabilities.
   Teachers may feel overwhelmed by the expectations and responsibilities for teaching learners with diverse need of learning; this may be, because teachers sometimes lack the skills and attitudes to engage with different kinds of learners. Teachers need to be prepared and ready to go an extra mile for learners with profound learning disabilities as they were previously excluded. Learners with profound disabilities should be socially and educationally accepted in the African context.

TI Creating strategies to deal with problems of teaching controversial
   issues in social studies education in African schools
SO INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION
AB The teaching of controversial issues has been widely viewed as preparing students for effective citizenship and, as such, is regarded as inevitable in social studies classrooms if students are to be able to think intelligently and to participate effectively in society. However, the effective implementation of issue-centered education in African schools, particularly in the area of social studies, is replete with problems. This paper examines those problems and concludes with some suggestions as to how controversial issues could be handled in our classrooms.

TI ON THE RELEVANCE OF AN AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY OF HIGHER EDUCATION
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Nowadays, higher educational theory seems to be concerned with positional thinking that reconsiders what universities ought to accomplish to justify their existence in the realm of higher education (Waghid and Davids, 2020). I want to extend this claim by arguing in defence of an African philosophy of higher education - one that is genuine and enframes higher education as a pedagogical space for resistance, critique, deliberative iterations, autonomy, and intellectual activism. Put differently, an African philosophy of higher education is one that is not only concerned with thinking and justification but expands into notions of democratic engagement, citizenship, and activism. When the latter are present, African philosophy of higher education has a real chance of manifesting ubiquitously in higher pedagogical actions, mostly teaching and learning. Only then, it possibly maintains its relevance to higher education discourses.

AB Information technologies have an active role in the educational field today. In developed countries, education is enriched by the contribution of Information Technology (IT) because personal computers (PC) can help learning. At the same time, developing countries suffer from problems such as poor attendance rate at schools as well as poor literacy rate. To solve this problem, many schools are established by NGO. Although these schools provide education and support to such children, they have the problem of scarcity of teachers. Therefore we introduce tablet personal computers (TPC) in this school to solve the problem. To solve the problem of children's illiteracy, we developed a tabletbased puzzle game for language learning. We tested this application in two NGO schools. In spite of their first use of TPCs, they became familiar with using them in about 10 minutes. This paper elucidates the usefulness of the TPC in educational field in developing countries and the problem of introducing TPC in order to effectively deal with the problem of illiteracy.

The study uses a qualitative single case study research methodology complemented with a quantitative approach. Both purposeful and convenient samplings were used in the selection of 28 participants. Semi-structured interviews and observation were used for the collection of data. The results showed that many lecturers do not clearly understand the concept of S-L. It is therefore recommended that lecturers be provided with skills development on S-L to improve its implementation in South African higher education.

TI Indigenous anti-colonial knowledge as 'heritage knowledge' for promoting
   Black/African education in diasporic contexts
SO DECOLONIZATION-INDIGENEITY EDUCATION & SOCIETY
AB This paper addresses some serious questions in the discussions around Black/African diasporic education: As African scholars how do we begin to pioneer new analytical systems for understanding our local/Indigenous communities and what are the challenges we are likely to be faced with? What are the intellectual and political merits of developing and promoting our own "home grown Indigenous perspectives steeped in culture-specific paradigms" (Yankah, 2004, p.26) in the Western academy? This is an opportunity and a challenge in the struggle to save myself/ourselves from becoming "intellectual imposter[s]", simply good at mimicking dominant theories and knowledges (Nyamnjoh, 2012) in the [Western] academy. We need to replace our 'cultural estrangement' with a 'cultural engagement' in the pursuit and promotion of African/Black education in Diasporic contexts. For African learners we need develop theoretical prisms or perspectives that are able to account for our lived experiences and our relationality with other learners, prisms rooted in our cultures, histories and heritage. I intervene in the discussion through transgressive pedagogies, by way of Indigenous epistemologies, to seek different ways for educational transformation for all learners. I borrow the ideas of pioneering Black/African scholars like W.E. B. Du Bois and Franz Fanon as I articulate an 'Indigenist anticolonial' framework for understanding issues of Black/African education for the 'global good'. I use my long standing work in the Canadian school system to ground issues in the discussion. Nyamnyoh (2012) notes, in writing about the Diasporic encounter, that as those who move and/or are forced to move, we cannot position ourselves simply in relation to those we meet on the journey. We must stake out our own discursive and political positions. We must be true to our authentic selves as African subjects of knowing.

AB This article investigates the developments in the social justice function of clinical legal education in African countries. It is based on a systematic review conducted to provide conceptual, methodological and thematic guidance into scholarship on the utilisation of clinical legal education in African countries to meet justice needs of the indigent in society. The results are analysed and clustered into themes about scholarship on the law school, the university law clinic and challenges encountered in this endeavour. The narrative findings suggest an increased application of clinical legal education as a result of reforms in African law schools although this increase is not supported by a corresponding increase in related research and publication. The article therefore highlights gaps in knowledge and delineates a future trajectory by making suggestions for further research.

SO JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
AB The following is a "conversation" between two of the most prominent and prolific African American scholars and intellectuals, bell hooks and Carter G. Woodson. Though their works were published more than 60 years apart, many of the issues Woodson addressed in his now-classic work, The Miseducation of the Negro, remain significant for African American intellectuals today. What is education? And what does is mean to truly "transgress" the boundaries of tradition?.

TI Political economy of higher education: comparing South Africa to trends
   in the world
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Education is one of the major linchpins of economic, social and political development of any nation. Recent evidence suggests that higher education can produce both public and private benefits. Thus, the role of the state in making education policy, and funding education is indeed critical, and cannot be left to be determined by market forces alone. Nevertheless, the trend of inadequate government funding for universities, loss of autonomy, infrastructural decay, falling academic standards, politicization and privatization of education, etc. appear to be a worldwide phenomenon and not just restricted to the developing world. South African higher education shows much promise with respect to knowledge production and dissemination, to contributing to social equity, economic and social development and democracy, and to the development needs of the Southern African region and the African continent. However, higher education in South Africa is under considerable stress from domestic and international trends that are redefining the nature and role of public sector post-secondary education (PSE) institutions worldwide. The paper will outline the role of PSE in the knowledge economy and the impact of the neoliberal context on the evolution of higher education in South Africa and the world. Given the significant developmental implications of investment in higher education, the authors argue that relegating this important public policy issue to the market forces is likely to promote inequality in the society, along with negative consequences for socio-political stability, economic sustainability, and knowledge generation.

SO RIDE-THE JOURNAL OF APPLIED THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article considers the opportunities presented by - and the obstacles preventing - the adoption of online resources in teaching Shakespeare in South Africa. Taking into account Shakespeare's controversial place in South African education, it addresses the widely differing contexts in which Shakespeare might be encountered in the country's classrooms. The author discusses his own experience of digital platforms in teaching Shakespeare to undergraduate university students and in developing the website Shakespeare ZA (), reflecting on the mutually informing relationship between digital engagements with Shakespeare-in-performance, multilingualism, reading practice and 'literacies' more broadly construed.

TI Theological education in tropical Africa: An essay in honour of
   Christina Landman and a Kenyan perspective
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB Christina Landman is a professor of Theology at the Research Institute for Theology and Religion, University of South Africa. As an East African serving under her as a research fellow at the Research Institute of Theology and Religion since 2014, and as somebody whose articles have been published in the two journals where she has been the editor, I can only honour her by contributing to her festschrift and in basing my reflections on my understanding of theological education in tropical Africa, where she plays a critical role - despite my bias towards East Africa, and Kenya in particular. In other words, the goal of this article is to focus on the future of theological education in Africa, with special reference to Eastern Africa, and Kenya in particular. How has Africa journeyed with theological education since its inception in the 19th and 20th century? How is it reflected in the academic institutions of higher learning, in ministerial training, in general academic contexts and in local congregations (churches)? Is it Africanity without ethics? Does it have a future? In addressing these concerns, the article employs historic-analytical design in its endeavour to assess the efficacy of theological education as an agent of social transformation in 21st-century Africa. Considering that Africa cannot be identified as a single geocultural context and/or as a monolithic entity, the article builds its case by mainly referring to the Kenyan context. Its methodology includes an extensive literature review of some materials that are connected to theological education, participant observation and personal reflections as an educationist in an African context. The methodology will also include the Protestant divinity school that was established in Frere Town, Mombasa, and later shifted to Limuru, Central Kenya, in 1929. It is set on the premise that the future of theological education in Africa is guaranteed by the growing interest in theological education among the youth, especially in the 21st century.

TI South African higher education language politics post #RhodesMustFall:
   The terrain of advanced language politics
SO SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB In 2015, South African higher education witnessed student-driven activism in the form of various #movements, beginning with the #RhodesMustFall campaign at the University of Cape Town, which morphed into the national #FeesMustFall movement. A corollary to these #movements was a language-specific #movement namely #AfrikaansMustFall. Very little literature exists on this latter movement in contrast to the sizeable literature corpus on the other two #movements. While highlighting this hiatus in the research literature, through a combination of extensive literature review and polemical analytic auto-ethnographic analysis, the article argues that the language contestations in south African higher education after #RhodesMustFall transcend the provincialism that hitherto defined language politics in the sector. To advance this thesis, the article argues that south African higher education language politics post #RhodesMustFall are an invitation to the terrain of advanced language politics. Advanced language politics transcends the traditional (and somewhat normalised) realm of the analogous relationship between language, the nation(-state) and reductionist ethnocentrism, and ventures onto the realm of language as a marker and means to (re)affirm, celebrate and advance value in the furtherance of human dignity, (social) justice, diversity of peoples and knowledges, fluid and multiple identities, fraternity, equality, globalism and egalitarianism - including egalitarian knowledge access.

AB Intentionally separate schools continue to educate African American students in spite of the Brown v. Board of Education (1954) decision, revealing the value of and continued need for such institutions. Little is known about the practices of these schools, the kind of education that they provide for African American students, and the potential implications these institutions might have for our broader educational system. Interviews, classroom observations, and document analyses, conducted over a period of nine months, result in a portrait of a separate school that reveals the very explicit ways in which teachers help students to develop a positive Black identity and understand the connection between their success and the success of their community.

TI African Education Challenges and Policy Responses: Evaluation of the
   Effectiveness of the African Development Bank's Assistance
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB P>From marginal access to school before 1960, African modern education systems expanded steadily during the 1960s and 1970s, prompted by high priority given to education. The 1980s experienced stagnation and decline due to a drastic decrease in education financing further to the balance of payment and budget deficits, and the ensuing structural adjustment programmes. Since 1990, there have been intensified efforts to reverse the trend through national and international efforts. The African education sector continues to face serious challenges of low and inequitable access to education, irrelevant curriculum and poor learning outcomes, inadequate political commitment and financing, weak education system capacity, and weak link with the world of work. Drawing on relevant documents and data, the paper discusses briefly those challenges and the education policy measures taken to address them. It also assesses to what extent the Bank response was relevant and effective in addressing the African education challenges. While progress has been made in bringing more children to schools, the results in terms of quantity and quality have been far from the targets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper concludes with a call for a greater effort to keep the promise for education for all and for quality education. This may require an invitation for a new forum on education to take stock and try again more realistic policies and better defined means to effectively implement them. The forum's resolutions should not be limited to the primary education but consider the education sector as a whole in the context of a globalized economy and labor market.

AB This paper discusses various issues that have plagued library and information science education in Africa since the first programmes were established.  A brief historical development of library education is provided, and an analysis of the issues presented.  Unresolved issues such as professionalism, standards, research degrees and recruitment of students are discussed.  For the future, it is noted that attention should be given to areas such as changes in the curricula, community service, public education, and the formation of an Association of Library Educators, among others.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This rejoinder is in response to criticism against the African Virtual University (AVU), an internet-based education modality, by Amutabi and Oketch [2003. Experimenting in distance education: the African Virtual University (AVU) and the Paradox of World Bank in Kenya. International Journal of Educational Development 23, 57-73]. By closely focusing on AVU "foreignness", its equity effects, as well as questions about its sustainability, this riposte argues that the origins, developments and modus operandi of the new virtual educational system mirrors that of the state universities in Kenya. The paper concludes by arguing in favor of the theory of isomorphism as a more comprehensive analytical framework for assessing complexities of the development and role of internet-based education in developing countries.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB PurposeThis study examines whether education in developing countries directly impacts their foreign income from the top export sector.Design/methodology/approachAs most developing countries follow developed nations to shape their development, this study assumes developing countries as education-follower and developed countries as education-leader countries. Considering selected countries from the South Asian Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and African countries as follower countries and Group of Seven (G7) as leader countries, this study employs Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger non-causality tests.FindingsThis study finds that education-follower countries' achievements do not directly impact foreign earnings from their leading export sectors. However, findings also confirm that leader countries have a bidirectional causal relationship between tertiary education and earnings from high technology exports.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study urging research-intensive education with comparative advantages in international trade. Using educational attainment on export earnings from the leading sector, findings support dependency theory in education is still existed.

TI Anti-Colonial Orientations to Place: Unsettling Encounters with South
   African Educational Landscapes
SO EQUITY & EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION
AB The authors bring together decolonial, place attuned, and critical posthumanist orientations to analyze an event during a residential workshop organized as part of a state-funded research project on decolonizing early childhood discourses in South Africa. An invitation during the workshop to grapple with what might be unsettling by attending to the agency of the more-than-human world and its entanglement with unequal human geographies of place, generated a diffractive photographic image and unsettling stories as a group of early childhood teachers and educational researchers kept re-turning to the data. Working with Barad's methodology of temporal diffraction as apparatus, we discursively and visually trace entanglements that emerged from this data. We conclude on the mattering of this work for engaging with the potentials and tensions of attending to the more-than-human within highly asymmetrical human relations in the settler colonial context of South African education.

AB In the context of the increasing use of ICTs as a medium for higher education delivery across national borders, the World Bank established the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN). GDLN's official mission was to facilitate rapid and simultaneous dissemination of knowledge to audiences in various socio-geographic spaces and the expansion of the opportunity for tertiary education in developing countries. Using the case of Centre d'Education a Distance de Cote d'Ivoire, one of the GDLN national institutional affiliates in Africa, this study illustrates the agendas of liberalization and globalization through ICTs in spite of the potential for local educational gains.

TI Entrepreneurship education for a renascent Africa
SO ROUTLEDGE COMPANION TO BUSINESS IN AFRICA
SE Routledge Companions in Business Management and Accounting
AB For African countries to compete effectively in the global economy, a 'transformative agenda' is needed. This agenda should necessarily promote the spirit of entrepreneurship as a strategic imperative at national levels. Fundamentally, this requires unblocking institutional impediments to entrepreneurship education and training. Against this backcloth, this chapter explores how the prevalent modes of entrepreneurship education within African educational systems have continued to be impacted upon by outmoded colonial values and the implications for developing modern entrepreneurial skills. It does this by comparing the relative traits that underpin differences in attitudes towards entrepreneurship among groups. The study draws from Bowlby et al.'s (2010) cross-national study, which was subsequently extended to Morocco (of which this study is a part). Thus, using samples drawn from Morocco, a link between educational system and entrepreneurial spirit is reconfirmed. But, more fundamentally, it finds that inappropriate pedagogical models have continued to negatively impact efforts to enhance entrepreneurship training and education. Many entrepreneurial programmes are rooted in colonial orthodoxies and, therefore, are unfit for purpose when put alongside developmental needs of a renascent Africa. To enhance national competitiveness, and to grow and sustain the spirit of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship curricula should build away from Africa's colonial past

AB This article describes a South Africa-based training programme in multilingual education for African educators and assesses its potentially transformative effects on participants. Based on a range of data collected during four course runs, as well as an e-mail survey of past participants, the authors explore how the programme has supported educators in promoting mother tongue-based schooling in multilingual African contexts. There is also a discussion of principal challenges involved in delivering a course that balances theory, ideology and practical knowledge. The authors conclude with implications for similar courses to positively impact educational practice in multilingual settings.

AB The importance of information security cannot be denied. It has increasingly become an integral part of our everyday lives. In line with some of the key issues relating to the construction of a South African education and training system for the 21st century, this paper argues that information security is both 'a social and economic need' and 'an intellectual and professional challenge' and should therefore be regarded as a critical cross-field outcome. This could help narrow the evident 'information security gap' that currently exists in undergraduate IT/IS/CS curricula at South African universities.

TI Humanity, expectations, access and transformation (HEAT): revisiting
   South African higher education entrance assessment in a postcolonial
   context
SO STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Entrance assessment and standardized testing is a feature of the South African higher education landscape, with many universities using assessment and testing as benchmarking, placement or, in some instances, gatekeeping exercises. Entrance assessment practices seek to inform universities about the capabilities of students. In this paper we examine current entrance assessment paradigms and practices through our frame of humanity, expectations, access and transformation (HEAT) embedded in a broader lens of postcolonialism. We claim that current practices do not lay a foundation for meeting the larger goals of higher education - they do not transform human relationships, ignore ways of being in the world, fail to sufficiently embed learning-centred teaching, nor promote metacognitive development, self-efficacy, resilience or lead to transformation. In so doing, we contribute a new way of thinking about the transformation of higher education today and the way in which diagnostic assessment could be re-visited to meet broader goals.

   AMERICAN GIRLS IN PRE-K-12 SETTINGS: IMPLICATIONS FOR ACCESS, EQUITY AND

SE Contemporary Perspectives on Access Equity and Achievement
AB Nationally, the state of education of African American girls warrants a culturally sensitive investigation (CSI). In 2015, a CSI is needed to respond to what is happening in the academic achievement among African American girls. The metaphor of CSI situates a problem solving approach that accentuates both the positive experiences and negative experiences of their educational performance. This chapter discusses the CSI evidence found in societal, education and schooling issues of African American girls and shares suggestions for improving their education in pre-K-12 experiences.

TI The international impact of Education research done and published in
   South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB The aim of this article was to determine the international impact of Education research in South Africa, through a citation analysis of articles published in the South African Journal of Education from 2000 to 2010 The citation impact (nationally as well as internationally) was found to be low. The international impact has been particularly poor, both quantitatively (in terms of the number of citations) and qualitatively (in terms of the standing of the publications in which this research does get cited, seen in the context of the hierarchy of scholarly publications). The article shows that certain topics of research in South Africa fail to break through to the international arena at all, such as research on the current restructuring of education in South Africa. Research that was cited most often in international journals dealt with research methodology, creativity and entrepreneurship education, beliefs and perception studies, and language-in-education in South Africa. In conclusion, a number of recommendations are made for raising the international profile of Education research that is done in South Africa and for further research in pursuance of that objective.

TI Sociocultural paradoxes and issues in e-learning use in higher education
   Africa
SO GLOBALISATION SOCIETIES AND EDUCATION
AB Sociocultural issues are major contributing factors in mass acceptance and effective use of technology. These issues are often perceived to contradict the benefits the technology brings about. E-learning use in higher education in Africa, as a technology, faces some sociocultural barriers that contradict its promise and benefits. This paper identifies five social cultural paradoxes, namely globalisation, cultural identity, westernisation, authenticity and foreign ideologies, with the aim of creating awareness of, and eliciting the interventions required to improve the acceptance and use of e-learning. The paper presents the differing and contradictory views of technology advocates and technology sceptics on the use of e-learning in higher in Africa.

SO JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
AB Punctuated with terms such as at risk, dropout, and disadvantaged, Western educational discourse is replete with euphemisms for the reasons that Black youth underachieve or fail in school. This article highlights some of the contemporary developments in Ontario, Canada, focusing on issues of African Canadian education. Pertinent issues of sociological and historical relevance are discussed, with implications for education in the contemporary schooling context. Education must cultivate a sense of identity within culture and community, while working with ancestral cultural knowledge retentions. This calls for a revisioning of the educational system in public schools so as to (a) introduce a more effective method of teaching diverse youth, (b) create spaces where the needs of the most disadvantaged are seriously and concretely addressed (and not glossed over), (c) promote schools with strong ties to the community, and (d) help learners build their self-, collective, and cultural identities within an environment of social excellence.

TI Internationalisation of higher education in South Africa: A historical
   review
SO PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION
AB Current debates on internationalisation are couched in relation to globalisation, and gives the impression that this phenomenon is new. There is also a tendency to discuss internationalisation in relation to various rationales, with economic rationales being dominant. This article challenges the assumption that internationalisation is something new and the notion that it is mainly driven by economic rationales. It argues that in colonial contexts, international education is as old as the advent of colonialism. In the context of South Africa international education is as old as the emergence of higher education in South Africa. Therefore current discussions on the role of international education as part of, or a response to globalisation, should also incorporate the role of international education in colonial conquest and perpetuation of segregation, failing which, discussions of internationalisation will be superficial and not do justice to the complex, divided and conflict-ridden nature of South African society.

   Education in 1950
SO STUDIES IN WORLD CHRISTIANITY
AB From April to July of 1950, Bishop Stephen Neill (1900-84) took a sweeping tour of East and West Africa to assess the state of African theological education. He visited Egypt, Sudan and the six British territories in tropical Africa: Tanganyika, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Gold Coast (Ghana) and Sierra Leone. Employed by the World Council of Churches at the time, Neill was appointed by the International Missionary Council to spearhead the project. The overall objective was to shed insight on what could be done to improve the quality of theological education and the training of ministry in Africa. Neill produced a considerable amount of material during and after the trip, including a 120-page 'travel diary' and a 51-page confidential report.
   This paper has three goals: to explain how and why this tour of African theological education came together, to provide an overview of Neill's research trip through his diary entries and to reflect on Neill's conclusions and suggestions for what ought to be done.

TI Africa unknown: Addressing the effects of an alienating education
   amongst learners in South Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AFRICAN RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB The article argues for the Africanisation of the South African education system, most critically at high school and tertiary levels. Using both experiential and theoretical reasoning, it seeks to present a compelling argument for the value of teaching our children, using methodologies, examples and stories they can relate to. It argues that this relatability is what will best develop the cognition of learners and better equip them to turn knowledge into action. The South African education system has often been seen as lacking a critical thinking and problem-solving element, and the article argues that this limitation is embedded in the abstractness of our curricula. The article presents a short case study highlighting just how little about Africa some of our best learners know. It ends by offering practical suggestions about how the education system could incorporate critical African knowledge in its learning models.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB We identify current stressors in the professional lives of South African secondary school educators. The study was exploratory, using a questionnaire, which listed 19 possible causes of stress and was completed by 987 educators from all racial groups and provinces in the country. South African educators in general currently experience the following as stressors: uninuolved parents, poor learner discipline, lack of learner motivation, learners' negative attitudes towards themselves, numerous changes inside and outside the school, and lack of self-esteem. Male and female educators differed significantly in their perceptions of some stressors. Educators with six to 15 years of experience and who were between 36 and 45 years old differed significantly from others on some issues.

TI Expanding doctoral education in South Africa: pipeline or pipedream?
SO HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
AB The purpose of this paper is to discuss both the status of the PhD in South Africa and the feasibility of the country's aspiration to increase by fivefold the production of PhDs by 2025. Based on the first empirical studies on doctoral education in South Africa, it argues that in order to move towards this target, an expanded and coordinated effort is necessary. This includes the removal of barriers that hinder the expansion of the South African higher education system. In particular the paper highlights insufficient funding, policy that stands in the way of expansion, scarcity of students, limited supervisory capacity and lack of recognition of the value of the doctorate and higher learning, as well as limited and inadequate partnerships. The main question is whether South Africa can achieve the desired outcome by following international trends or whether the expansion target is merely a pipedream.

In search of a new operating system: Making education more relevant, responsive and authentic." We begin with an overview of the societal changes defining the early 21st century. We suggest that, in light of these changes, education praxis, education scholarship, and teacher education need to be re-designed with relevance, responsiveness, and authenticity if it is to meet the critical changes required.

TI The Ideal of African Scholarship and its Implications for Introductory
   Philosophy: the Example of Placide Tempels
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
AB Thinking of an academic discipline in terms of a 'social practice' (MacIntyre) helps in formulating what the ideal captured in the slogan 'African scholarship' can contribute to the discipline. For every practice is threatened by the attractiveness of goods external to the practice - in particular, competitiveness for its own sake and to counter this virtues of character are needed. African traditional culture prioritizes a normative picture of the human person which could very well contribute here to upholding the values internal to scholarship. I argue, contrary to Matolino, that for these purposes Tempe Is' notion of the transactional process of becoming more of what you are by virtue of the human insertion in nature, is a useful starting point. But the dominant way philosophy is framed today, the human person outside of 'nature', omitting the key notion of presence-to-self, disallows this dialogue between the dominant tradition and African thought culture. I show, by interrogating what I take to be an impoverished understanding of objectivity in the dominant philosophical approach, how the idea of personal, subjective, growth is crucial to introductory philosophy if the project of African scholarship is to find purchase. As an example I look at rival ways of understanding the value of justice, procedurally or, alternatively, substantively and hence foregrounding participation.(1)

TI HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE EARLY EDUCATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MINISTERS
SO CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB The education of African American ministers in the United States has been little researched. Numerous books address the profession of ministry and the education of Blacks in general, but most do not specifically address issues pertaining to the professional education of Black ministers. The majority of the hurdles African Americans faced were primarily in the South and were incurred by the institution of slavery. This does not imply that African Americans residing in the Northern states did not encounter more than their share of hurdles based on the color of their skin.

TI "It is Better to Light a Candle Than to Curse the Darkness": Ethel
   Thompson Overby and Democratic Schooling in Richmond, Virginia,
   1910-1958
SO EDUCATIONAL STUDIES-AESA
AB In 1933, Ethel Thompson Overby became the first African American female principal in Richmond, Virginia. Her motto was "It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness" (Overby 1975, 1). Before becoming principal, Overby had been a teacher in the southern urban de jure segregated schools of the city. How did the racially segregated context impact her understanding of democracy as an African American woman? As a teacher, what educational practices did she subscribe to? What educational theorizing underpinned her educational practices as a teacher and as a principal? Who was she? These were the questions that guided this research into the educational theorizing of Ethel T.Overby. This research seeks to further the understanding of the theorizing that underpinned the educational practices of African American female teachers and principals who taught and led in public urban de jure segregated southern schools (Charron 2009; Johnson 2000; May 2007; Walker 2009). This historical qualitative research provides knowledge about the educational theorizing of African American educators and how past practices can support the educational fortitude of African American students today.

TI Technology enhanced teaching and learning in South African higher
   education - A rearview of a 20 year journey
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB In the last 20 years, the South African higher education has changed significantly, influenced by global trends national development goals and pressure from local educational imperatives, in the context of a digitally networked world. Shifts in technology enhanced pedagogical practices and in discourses around information and communication technologies (ICTs) have had varying degrees of influence in higher education. This paper takes a rearview of a 20-year journey of technology enhanced learning in South African higher education. An analysis of literature view is presented chronologically in four phases: phase 1 (1996-2000), phase 2 (2001-05), phase 3 (2006-10) and phase 4 (2011-16). In phase 1 technology was used predominantly for drill and practice, computer-aided instruction, with growing consciousness of the digital divide. In phase 2 institutions primarily focused on building ICT infrastructure, democratizing information, policy development and research; they sought to compare the effectiveness of teaching with or without technology. During phase 3 institutions began to include ICTs in their strategic directions, digital divide debates focused on epistemological access, and they also began to conduct research with a pedagogical agenda. In phase 4 mobile learning and social media came to the fore. The research agenda shifted from whether students would use technology to how to exploit what students already use to transform teaching and learning practices. The paper concludes that South Africa's higher education institutions have moved from being solely responsible for both their own relatively poor ICT infrastructure and education provision to cloud-based ICT infrastructure with "unlimited" educational resources that are freely, openly and easily available within and beyond the institution. Although mobile and social media are more evident now than ever before, teaching and learning practice in South African higher education remains largely unchanged.

TI Tracking the Money for Open Educational Resources in South African basic
   Education: What We Don't Know
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING
AB Limited research has been done to date on the extent of public funding of Open Educational Resources (OER) within basic education (K-12 equivalent) in South Africa. As claims have been made about the potential cost reductions that come with using OER, this study aimed to establish a benchmark of public spending on educational resources, uncover how much is being spent on OER and assess cost-savings of OER adoption.
   A desk review and document analysis of official information sources on South African basic education was conducted to develop a conceptual understanding of funding allocations the South African government uses for educational resources. A review of publicly available government reports and budgets showed that there is insufficient information at this time to determine how much is being spent on OER specifically or to act as a benchmark for potential cost savings of OER. This study highlights the information gaps which would need to be filled in order to make claims about OER and their potential as cost savers.

TI The governance of the South African higher education system: balancing
   state control and state supervision in co-operative governance?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The publication of the National Commission for Higher Education (NCHE) in 1996 was hailed as the first systematic attempt to map out a policy terrain for higher education in South Africa since the elections of April 1994. Its recommendations, particularly on the governance of higher education, elicited much discussion and debate. The debate continued (and continues) with the publication of the Green and White Papers, the Bill on Higher Education, and the Higher Education Act (HEA) in late 1997.
   This paper explores and seeks to clarify the emerging model of educational governance that has been accepted by the Ministry of Education in South Africa as the basis for managing and transforming the inherited system of higher education. Specifically, the paper considers the philosophy of "co-operative governance" and the governance recommendations of the NCHE Report and the HEA. These documents are examined in relation to state control and state supervision models of higher education governance. The paper concludes by considering the politics of policy development in the transformation of the South African higher education governance system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It outlines ambiguities within and between competing policies, tracing the historical trajectory and explaining its outcome. Apartheid governance, the attempts to reform it, policy options originating within the anti-apartheid movement, and the law passed in 1996 by the new Parliament, are discussed. Trends in South Africa during this decade have been consistent with trends in international education: decentralization, 'rolling back the state', privatization, increased class and/or regional disparities, and greater parental governance responsibilities.

This article offers our learning as leaders of a multicultural community of university educators that seeks to contribute towards repairing the damages of a divided and discriminatory past by means of self-study research. Through a collaborative arts-informed analysis process, we have heard multiple perspectives from community participants and expressed our own learning in dialogue with theirs. This has enabled us to recognize shared qualities of caring, listening, and creativity as vital to a socially just reimagining of higher education communities.

TI LIS Education in the Digital Age for an African Agenda
SO LIBRARY TRENDS
AB To provide an expos of digital-age library and information science (US) education for an African agenda, this paper adopts an emergent qualitative research design by drawing on the literature on US education in Africa. It also draws on data gleaned from a survey of heads of schools of LIS in South Africa, and from content analyses of LIS school websites in South Africa and selected parts of the continent. The paper locates its narrative within Abbott's chaos of disciplines theory and concludes that the US discipline's "interstitial nature," its "fractal distinctions in time," and the resulting chaos of disciplines should not be seen as a crisis for LIS education in Africa and globally, but as an opportunity for a paradigm shift to broaden the US disciplinary domain and to stake an intellectual claim on this extended domain and so contribute to the growth and development of US services in Africa within the context of an African development agenda.

TI Incorporating cultural action models in university-based adult
   education: the Ghanaian experience
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFELONG EDUCATION
AB Within the past two decades, mainstreaming culture in education has taken centre stage in Africa. This development has been facilitated by the fact that western education introduced in Africa during the era of colonialism marginalised indigenous knowledge systems. Although since independence African governments have made several attempts to reform education in order to make it more culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of Africans, the education system in Africa continues to reflect western values and knowledge sources. Non-western knowledge production sources continue to be neglected in universities in Africa. This paper discusses the philosophy behind the establishment of university-based adult education in Ghana and its trajectory since its establishment. The paper argues that although adult education is dynamic and transformational, there is a need to incorporate indigenous sources of knowledge. The paper proposes that cultural action models such as communalism and spirituality should be incorporated into the teaching of adult education.

SO TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB This paper, originally given as an address to an African audience of students and academics, examines the functions of education in Africa and argues that the western-oriented approach at tertiary level is injurious to the intellectual development of students. It sets out an analysis of the processes at work in the University of Ghana which alienate students from their own cultural and socio-economic experiences. Using the example of social work education since its inception in 1958 at the University of Ghana, this paper considers the nature of western-oriented curricula, detailing their impact on student learning and African scholarship. Finally, it is argued that the psychological legacy of the colonial era perpetuates the failure of African academia to effectively confront the dominance of Anglo-American paradigms.

AB Education has been challenged to respond to the inequality of the past and rapid changing demands of the world of work. Past studies revealed that the South African's apartheid legacy left many sectors and professions with skewed demographic profiles. It is argues that after twenty years of democracy, the shift in demographics in most cases has been miniscule and transformation clearly needs to be accelerated. Acceleration of transformation means that the responsibility of the South Africa education system is to ensure that its curriculum creates equal opportunities for all students that prepare them for the world of work and develop skills and knowledge for all students to take responsibility for their own learning. This paper is based on the premise that, decentralisation and good governance could assist with effective and corrective measures to put the South African education sector in the right path accepted by international standard.

TI Can African scholars speak? Situating African voices in International
   Communication scholarship
SO MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This article seeks to contribute and engage with debates pertaining to epistemology, knowledge production, and positionality of 'International Communication Studies' (ICS) in sub-Saharan Africa. The study operates on the assumption that International Communication studies in most Sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by tales of marginalization, poverty, wars, and tribal conflicts. While this approach speaks to the notion of development communication, it is insufficient to bolster the contributions of African scholarship to the global literature. In turn, ICS in Africa is treated as second class and dependent on Western scholarship for survival. Against this backdrop, the study interrogates the position of African scholarship, arguing that most research contributions are treated as repositories for raw data with no epistemological knowledge to contribute to the global network platform.

TI Decolonising inclusive education in lower income, Southern African
   educational contexts
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB The article proposes the need for the decolonising of the inclusive education movement in Southern African educational contexts. It draws on the authors' own research and reflexive engagement over the last five years on inclusive education policy formulation and implementation in selected Southern African contexts, namely, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Malawi. The article interrogates inclusive education policy enactment in the four country contexts through the lens of the theory of practice architectures, focusing mainly on the 'sayings' and 'performings.' The analysis highlights that discourses of inclusive education, which continue to be influenced by traditional special education ideologies from the global North and appropriated by the South have the power to undermine or subvert the inclusive education agenda in contexts shaped by neo-colonialism. The article argues for a critical inclusive education agenda located within social justice theory to enable the decolonising of inclusive education. The reflexive and ethical stance of a social justice framework has the power to identify, untangle and disrupt pervasive special education notions from the North, and challenge education administrators, school leaders at all levels and teachers to engage in ideological critique as they enact inclusive education policy and seek to address exclusion and oppression within the education system.

SO IMPROVING SCHOOLS
AB The focus of this research is cultural sustainability of African Canadian heritage. Research literature informs us that engaging youth in educational programmes at the local level is fundamental to sustainability discussions. Furthermore, students must be actively engaged in their African Canadian past, present and future education. However, there has been a lack of curricula and resources of African Canadian heritage in programmes, resulting in African Canadian students being unaware of the history, culture and positive contributions of their leaders to society. Educators of African heritage in Nova Scotia have developed African Canadian Studies 11. The interview data from African Canadian educators and students reveal the process for the development and implementation of this curriculum, the challenges that African Canadian educators face and the ways in which students become actively engaged in learning. The author suggests that this research has implications for cultural sustainability at the local and community level.

We explored the relationship between student involvement in cocurricular activities and learning outcomes related to collective leadership for social change. Data were collected via a survey of 1,309 students that included demographics, cocurricular involvement, and self-reported learning outcomes. Culturally relevant frameworks, Sartorius and Sartoriuss (2013) theory of historical legacies of apartheid, and previous work on student engagement in South Africa framed the exploratory model. Regression analysis revealed a noncredit leadership course, sense of belonging and student involvement as significant predictors of social change.

Through the implementation of critical literature review methodology and comparing similarities and differences among SAHEIs in their reporting of their attempts at benchmarking, this article will present concrete proposals for a pathway to effective benchmarking of community engagement at SAHEIs. SAHEIs have looked at conceptual models to enable high-quality community engagement, but effective measuring tools have eluded their efforts. Through evaluating the critiques and recommendations of the Higher Education Quality Committee at all SAHEIs regarding community engagement as well as the responses thereto, this article will discuss the obstacles to developing quality assurance of community engagement and the prospects for overcoming them. Insights into key elements required in the benchmarking of community engagement will be drawn from the history of community engagement at SAHEIs from apartheid to democracy.

TI Science mapping the knowledge base on educational leadership and
   management in Africa, 1960?2018
SO SCHOOL LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT
AB This review of research employed science mapping to analyse the intellectual structure of the knowledge base on educational leadership and management in Africa. The review analysed 645 Scopus-indexed documents on EDLM in Africa published between 1960 and 2018. Meta data associated with these documents were analysed using the VOSviewer software. The complementary use of citation and co-citation analysis determined that 95% of the African literature in EDLM has been published since 2000. Geographical distribution of African scholarship was highly skewed with South African scholarship accounting for 74% of the corpus. Citations analyses also identified highly cited scholars and documents within this literature. Analysis of the intellectual structure of the African EDLM knowledge base identified four main Schools of Thought. Three of these were comprised primarily of Africa-based scholarship and determined to be 'distinctively African' in terms of topical foci. The ?research front? or most current topical trend in this literature concerns leadership for educational and social transformation. Recommendations are made for building capacity among African EDLM scholars as well as for next steps in advancing the literature.

TI Migration and education in Zimbabwe and South Africa
SO SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF AFRICAN STUDIES
AB How African migrants establish themselves within new contexts through struggles for education is a relatively under-researched phenomenon in South Africa. The notion of "idioms of rootlessness" has been developed to make sense of migrants' understandings of new hostile environments. This article troubles this botanical metaphor through an exploration of the life-history of one Zimbabwean woman who migrated to South Africa and the specific role of education in her trajectory in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Her story is examined against the backdrop of the changing political economy of education in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In highlighting how she navigates borders for the education of her children and decides which children to educate where it shows how educational values, beliefs and practices also migrate. The paper argues that her struggle for the education of her children can also be interpreted as an expression of the desire for attachment in both spaces and as a means of claiming a place in both countries, across borders, for herself and her children.

TI From teachers to educators: Homogenising tendencies in contemporary
   South African educational reforms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper argues that the sociological literature concerning teachers' identities and their social locations have tended to concentrate primarily on only two aspects of teachers: teachers as workers; and, teachers as professionals. Whilst these are still relevant in considering the forces impacting upon teachers they are by no means sufficient. Teachers are more than just workers and professionals. They are raced, gendered, with different sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and so on, and their identities and consequently their daily, lived experiences on these levels also need attention. Locating the discussion within contemporary South African education and noting the shift in nomenclature from 'the teacher' to 'the educator', I point out that there is a consistent tendency in discursively projecting teachers in homogenised and generalised ways which cannot 'speak' analytically to the situated realities of teachers. In this regard, I use two case examples of teachers in different contexts to point to the importance of incorporating theoretically a more complex and nuanced understanding of the constitutive elements that make up 'the teacher/educator'.

TI Languages, development and reconstructing education in South Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The educational crisis in South Africa is examined against the history of language-in-education policy over the last 25 years. The Soweto student revolt in 1976 is identified as a pivotal point, resulting in educational responses which have exacerbated academic failure amongst the majority of school students.
   The vexed role of African languages in education, vis-a-vis structural constraints, including international 'aid', across the continent is discussed as a textured background from which innovative South African educators have had an opportunity to take cognisance.
   The argument in this article is that curriculum and language-in-education policy changes which came into force in 1997, whilst based on the goal of an equitable school system, are unfortunately flawed both in the conceptualisation process and implementation strategy. The role of African languages, despite policy statements to the contrary, is not adequately addressed.
   Suggestions which are influenced by developments elsewhere on the continent are offered as alternatives to reconstructing viable education in the country. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI EDUCATIONAL CONTROVERSIES - AFRICAN ACTIVISM AND EDUCATIONAL-STRATEGIES
   IN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, 1920-1934
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB This article examines three case studies of conflict between Africans' concepts of what education should be, and the education actually available in schools in Southern Rhodesia. It focuses on the 1920s and early 1930s, when African education first expanded and attained new levels of direct government involvement, and then began to contract under the economic pressure of the depression. In the Gutu district, students and parents fought for alternatives to the Dutch Reformed Church schools, attempting to enlist government support for alternatives, and attending independent schools. At Inyati, a London Missionary Society school, dissatisfied students struck, forcing major changes on the school as the mission acknowledged a need to provide pupils with not merely subsistence and disciplined learning, but also respect and advancement. The government's schools started out with strikes over academic and industrial curricula, and provided, in the contrast between Domboshawa's relative health and popularity, and Tjolotjo's continued conflict and problems, a lesson in the need to make compromises to achieve successful educational policy.
   Ultimately, student activism, through protests, strikes, or appeals, did alter the curricula, and the forms of discipline, of schools in Southern Rhodesia. But the changes were limited. Protests did not produce an educational system capable of allowing Africans to compete effectively with Europeans. Nevertheless these struggles taught important lessons about alliance formation, the presentation of demands, and negotiation. These lessons, and students' apprenticeship in activism, may have been as important as any formal curricular changes.
