AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a profound impact on the organization and delivery of clinical services in drug abuse treatment programs. The need for emphasis on HIV prevention vs. treatment services has varied with the geographic distribution of HIV infection among drug injectors. On-site primary medical care services have been developed in some treatment programs, whereas other programs have had to formalize arrangements for referral or contractual care with outside medical providers. No single model of care is necessarily appropriate for all drug treatment programs, and, along with the potential benefit, each may pose structural challenges that need to be addressed. The advent of the AIDS epidemic may have served in an inadvertently positive way, to draw attention to the increasingly illogical separation between di-Ecg abuse treatment and the larger medical care system. This review will examine the epidemiologic, clinical, organizational, and policy issues generated by the increased medical needs of drug users with HN infection in treatment program settings.

AB States and communities use many strategies and policies to facilitate the integration of HIV and AIDS services with alcoholism and drug abuse treatment and prevention programs. Massachusetts' policy initiatives that promoted collaboration between substance abuse programs and AIDS services are outlined The review begins with an overview of the HIV epidemic in Massachusetts and reflects on the initial challenges of building system capacity so that HIV and substance abuse services could become more closely integrated. The discussion summarizes specific policy strategies implemented to encourage system development and to develop program and staff skills for working with men and women with HIV/AIDS and at risk of infection. The initiatives included integration of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment programs, expansion of Medicaid reimbursement for substance abuse treatment training and skills development for counselors, and coordinated service development and advocacy for substance abuse and AIDS/HIV services.

AB This article provides information on harm reduction, a recent development in substance abuse services in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The author outlines abstinence and harm reduction perspectives and the stages of change model and discusses how these perspectives can be integrated in social work practice. He proposes using harm reduction strategies for individuals for whom the abstinence perspective may not be appropriate. Together, the traditional abstinence and harm reduction perspectives provide a basis for a more comprehensive continuum of care for individuals experiencing problems related to their substance use.

TI Adolescent substance abuse: A review of the past 10 years
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
AB Objective: To review and synthesize the recent scientific literature on adolescent substance abuse, covering natural history, epidemiology, etiology, comorbidity, assessment, treatment, and prevention, and to highlight areas for future research. Method: Studies of adolescent substance abuse were reviewed with the focus on substance abuse and dependence rather than substance use. Results: There has been a sharp recent resurgence in adolescent drug use. Biological factors, including genetic and temperament characteristics, as well as family environment factors, are emerging as important etiological variables. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, particularly with conduct disorder, is frequent and complicates treatment. New assessment instruments are available for clinical and research use, Among treatment modalities, family-based interventions have received the most study. Conclusions: The past decade has seen growth in the volume and sophistication of research on adolescent substance abuse and in the conceptualization of this problem. Further research is needed, particularly on the significance of comorbid conditions and on individualized and effective treatment approaches.

TI Gender differences in attitudes toward alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs
SO SOCIAL WORK
AB A number of differences exist between men and women in use patterns and risk factors for substance abuse. In recent years these differences have received increased attention; however, gender-related attitudes toward substance abuse need additional study. This study examines gender-related differences in beliefs about the causes of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; the power of various substances of abuse; the prevalence of substance use; and the effectiveness of various interventions. Women were more likely to attribute causality to biological or environmental factors, to perceive drugs as more powerful, to perceive a higher incidence of substance abuse, and to believe prevention and treatment were more effective. Therefore, prevention, assessment, and treatment programs should be designed differently for women than for men.

TI Competitive numerical analysis for stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model in
   a two-sex population
SO IET SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
AB This study is an attempt to explain a reliable numerical analysis of a stochastic HIV/AIDS model in a two-sex population considering counselling and antiretroviral therapy (ART). The authors are comparing the solutions of the stochastic and deterministic HIV/AIDS epidemic model. Here, an endeavour has been made to explain the stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model is comparatively more pragmatic in contrast with the deterministic HIV/AIDS epidemic model. The effect of threshold number H* holds on the stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model. If H* < 1 then condition helps us to control disease in a two-sex human population while H* > 1 explains the persistence of disease in the two-sex human population. Lamentably, numerical methods such as Euler-Maruyama, stochastic Euler, and stochastic Runge-Kutta do not work for large time step sizes. The recommended structure preserving framework of the stochastic non-standard finite difference (SNSFD) scheme conserve all vital characteristics such as positivity, boundedness, and dynamical consistency defined by Mickens. The effectiveness of counselling and ART may control HIV/AIDS in a two-sex population.

AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic needs constantly to be reanalyzed under subjective conditions. The increasing popularity of heating rituals in Malawi collectively represents the metaphorical malcontent of this catastrophic event. Beliefs are no more reflections of transcendent "tradition" than transformations of meaningfulness of mundane life. This is an innovative moral justification for normalizing human misery. However, the deterministic objectification by Western reductionism. blunders in to articulate the multi-faceted nature of the epidemic. Thus, international public health should be accountable for promoting a fruitful future for African people by reading the cultural, structural and symbolic contexts of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic.

TI Ethnic differences in the predictors of drug and alcohol abuse in
   hospitalized adolescents
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS
AB This study examined psychosocial correlates of drug and alcohol abuse in hospitalized adolescents and the extent to which these associations may be affected by ethnicity. Four hundred fifty- eight psychiatric inpatients, ages 12 - 19, completed measures of psychological functioning, environmental stress, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse. Multiple regression analyses examined the joint and independent predictors of drug and alcohol abuse for European Americans, Latino Americans, and African Americans separately. Seven variables - age, depression, impulsivity, low self- esteem, delinquent predisposition, low peer insecurity, and history of child abuse - jointly predicted drug abuse for all groups, and predicted alcohol abuse for European Americans and Latino Americans. However, several differences were noted with respect to which variables made independent contributions to the model. Such differences may reflect distinct risk factors for drug and alcohol abuse in these three ethnic groups and may also have implications for prevention and treatment programs.

TI Women living with drug abuse and HIV disease: Drug abuse treatment
   access and secondary prevention issues
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
AB In collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Health Resources and Services Administration is conducting a multisite, longitudinal study oil issues of service needs, service utilization, and access to care for drug abusers with HIV. This article discusses access to drug abuse treatment and HIV secondary prevention for 116 women interviewed during the study's first year in five U.S. cities. Using interview data from 115 service providers in those same cities, it also discusses drug abuse treatment availability and barriers to service expansion for drug users with HIV. Study findings indicate that there are highly significant gaps between the drug abuse treatment services these women feel they need and those they have been able to receive; these were particularly pronounced for drug detoxification and residential and outpatient drug-free treatment. Women who used crack cocaine or injection drugs had particularly high levels of need for residential and outpatient drug abuse treatment, while women who use crack were found to have significantly less experience with the drug abuse treatment system than IDUs. HIV secondary prevention was also found to be a critical need for these women, many of whom were engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for reinfection, infection with other diseases, and transmission to others. Providers indicated that lack of funding was the major barrier to expanding services for this population; other barriers, such as lack of ancillary services and transportation, were also noted. Two positive findings were that many drug abuse treatment agencies in these cities provide a wide range of ancillary services and that many different kinds of agencies offer drug abuse treatment services.

TI Substance Abuse and Public Health: A Multilevel Perspective and Multiple
   Responses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Substance abuse has been a thorny public health concern throughout human history. Manifestly, prevention and treatment are the two main strategies commonly adopted to tackle the problem of substance abuse. They are in fact cross-disciplinary, and they relate to the various domains of heredity, biology, psychology, cognitive science, family, social development and cultural structures. This special issue, "Substance Abuse, Environment and Public Health," has published empirical studies from different regions and countries globally to enhance the international exchange of latest views and findings on the etiology, processes and influences of substance abuse across different domains, through which a multilevel perspective is considered more helpful for analyzing its complex nature, courses and consequences. This in turn suggests the possible need to employ multiple responses dynamically and integratively in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse.

Few comprehensive interventions are available that effectively address the range of co-occurring problems associated with adolescent substance abuse. This article reviews the clinical interventions and research evidence supporting the use of Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) for adolescents with substance abuse and co-occurring problems. MDFT is uniquely suited to address adolescent substance abuse and related disorders given its comprehensive interventions that systematically target the multiple interacting risk factors underlying many developmental disruptions of adolescence.

TI Exploring health-seeking behavior among adolescent mothers during the
   Ebola epidemic in Western rural district of Freetown, Sierra Leone
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB BackgroundFrom 2014 to 2016, the largest Ebola outbreak in history threatened Sierra Leone and its neighbouring countries, Guinea and Liberia. The Ebola outbreak impacted pregnant adolescent girl's access to prenatal care during the pandemic. The aim of this study is to understand health-seeking behaviour among adolescent mothers who were pregnant during the Ebola epidemic in Waterloo, Sierra Leone.MethodsThe present qualitative study uses the "Three Delay" model, as a theoretical framework to understand and explore adolescent mother's health-seeking behaviour through four focus group discussions with five participants in each discussion group. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsA multitude of challenges were identified following the Ebola epidemic. The fear of contracting Ebola was a common reason for not seeking care or utilising services. This notion was perpetuated by perceptions in the community and participants personal experiences. Quarantines, national lockdowns, roadblocks, loss of income and extreme poverty were also identified as barriers to accessing health facilities during Ebola. The different encounters with health workers and the challenges that arose at the health facilities were subsequently additional discouraging factors influencing participant's decision not to seek health care.ConclusionMany of the pre-existing maternal health, societal and social-economic challenges were exacerbated during the Ebola. The epidemic also contributed new challenges such as public fear, mistrust towards health professionals and the health system. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on improving maternal care in general, but also improving preparedness for maternal care in case of future outbreaks, especially for the most vulnerable groups such as adolescent mothers.

TI Prediction of drug and alcohol abuse in hospitalized adolescents:
   Comparisons by gender and substance type
SO BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
AB The authors examined psychosocial correlates of drug and alcohol abuse in 462 hospitalized adolescents, and the extent to which these associations may be affected by gender or by substance type. Participants completed a battery of psychometrically-sound, self-report measures of psychological functioning, environmental stress, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse. Four multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the joint and independent predictors of drug abuse and alcohol abuse, for males and for females. Multiple regression analysis revealed that seven variables-age, depression, impulsivity, low self-esteem, delinquent predisposition, low peer insecurity, and history of child abuse-jointly predicted both drug and alcohol abuse, for both males and females. However, several differences were found with respect to which variables made independent contributions to the predictive models-with only delinquent predisposition making a significant independent contribution for all four conditions. We found distinct patterns of psychosocial predictor variables for drug and alcohol abuse, as well as distinct patterns for males and females. These results may reflect differing risk factors for drug abuse and alcohol abuse in adolescent psychiatric patients-and differing risk factors for males and females. Such differences have potential implications for prevention and treatment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI RELAPSE PREVENTION MODELS FOR SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT
SO PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB Relapse prevention (RP) techniques have been integrated into numerous aspects of substance abuse treatment and research. One of the most promising uses of RP techniques is to provide a conceptual framework for the delivery of outpatient drug-free substance abuse treatment. A number of writers and researchers have produced models of treatment using RP principles as the central philosophy and methodology. Several writers have created descriptive models which outline clinical recommendations on the uses of RP methods for substance abuse treatment. A number of researchers have created drug specific protocols which have allowed for the evaluation of specific RP methodologies with specific clinical populations. A third set of clinical researchers have combined RP techniques with other types of treatment materials to create integrated outpatient models of treatment. These models provide the field of substance abuse treatment with a clear framework for delivering outpatient substance abuse treatment. They are structured in such a way as to promote replication and evaluation. The development of this set of models allows for the systematic advancement of outpatient drug-free substance abuse treatment.

TI ESTIMATING THE COSTS OF SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TO THE MEDICAID HOSPITAL-CARE
   PROGRAM
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives. The purpose of this study was to develop a model, using the epidemiologic tool of attributable risk, for estimating the cost of substance abuse to Medicaid.
   Methods. Based on prior substance-use and morbidity research, population attributable risks for substance abuse-related diseases were calculated. (These risks measure the proportion of total disease cases attributable to smoking, drinking, and drug use.) The risks for each disease were applied to Medicaid hospital discharges and days on the 1991 National Hospital Discharge Survey that had these diseases as primary diagnoses. The cost of these substance abuse-related days were added to Medicaid hospital costs for direct treatment of substance abuse.
   Results. More than 60 medical conditions involving 1100 diagnoses were identified, at least in part, as attributable to substance abuse. Factoring these substance abuse-related conditions into hospital costs, 1 out of 5 Medicaid hospital days, or 4 million days, were spent on substance abuse-related care in 1991. In 1994, this would account for almost $8 billion in Medicaid expenditures.
   Conclusions. The use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs contributes significantly to hospital costs. To address rising costs, substance abuse treatment and prevention should be an integral part of any health care reform effort.

TI Adolescent substance abuse treatment outcome: The role of substance
   abuse problem severity, psychosocial, and treatment factors
SO JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB A structural equation model incorporating substance abuse problem severity, psychosocial risk and protection, and treatment variables examined adolescent drug abuse treatment outcome pathways across 6- and 12-month follow-up paints. Findings on resiliency factors and an empirical method adapted from previous research were used to select and assign 10 psychosocial factors to either a multiple protective factor index or a risk factor index. Gender, substance abuse problem severity, treatment modality, treatment length, and aftercare participation were also examined as outcome predictors. The findings suggest that treatment intensity decisions may be better informed by pretreatment psychosocial risk level rather than by substance abuse problem severity. The present study also suggests that drug-abusing adolescents who receive sufficiently long treatment, participate in aftercare, and possess at least 1 individual or interpersonal protective factor during their recovery process have the best chance to maintain gains made during treatment.

One of the most inspiring models concerning the interconnection of substance abuse and violence is the 13-model. Hereby the factors instigation, impellance, and inhibition are considered concerning the interconnection between the substance user and the risk situation. Until today, there are first promising programs for the prevention and treatment of substance induced violent behavior. These programs, e. g.

TI Discriminant analysis of factors differentiating among substance abuse
   treatment units in their provision of HIV AIDS harm reduction services
SO SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH
AB Given the association between HIV/AIDS and drug use, substance abuse treatment organizations must play a prominent role in the prevention of HIV/AIDS. Effective HIV/AIDS prevention efforts targeting intravenous drug users require the use of harm reduction strategies. Current substance abuse treatment approaches stress abstinence from drug use as the primary desired treatment outcome, which might be perceived to contradict harm reduction strategies. Using data from the notional Drug Abuse Treatment System Survey this article explores the effect of ideological beliefs held by substance abuse treatment personnel on the delivery of harm reduction services to clients in outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) units. Results of a discriminant analysis suggest that both abstinence-based ideologies of tore and harm reduction ideologies of tore distinguish between OSAT organizations engaged in harm reduction activities and organizations not engaged in such activities.

TI Adverse Childhood Experiences and Subsequent Substance Abuse in a Sample
   of Sexual Offenders: Implications for Treatment and Prevention
SO VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of substance abuse indicators in a sample of male sexual offenders (N = 679) and to examine the influence of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on the likelihood of substance abuse outcomes. Half of these sex offenders reported a history of drug or alcohol abuse, and nearly one in five reported a substance-related arrest. Higher ACE scores were associated with endorsement of a greater number of substance-abuse-related problems, suggesting that accumulation of early trauma may increase the likelihood for substance misuse. By enhancing our understanding of the frequency and antecedents of dynamic risk factors such as substance abuse, we can better devise clinical interventions that respond to the comprehensive needs of sexually abusive individuals and reduce risk for sexual reoffense. As well, early interventions for at-risk families and maltreated youth may interrupt their trajectory toward adulthood substance abuse and criminal behavior, including sex offending.

AB Adolescent alcohol and other drug abuse is an important public health concern, and the past two decades has seen a dramatic increase in the demand for interventions to address substance use problems among teenagers. This demand has led to the development of multiple primary, secondary, and tertiary substance abuse prevention programs, some of which have little theoretical basis and most of which currently operate in the absence of data supporting their effectiveness. Very recently, there has been increased emphasis on the goal of developing and testing theoretically based and empirically supported intervention approaches for adolescent substance abuse. We describe five ongoing research programs devoted to meeting this goal, The background and rationale for each research program are discussed, and preliminary efficacy data concerning the specific interventions are presented.

TI Exploring Roles of Stakeholders in Combating Substance Abuse in the
   DIMAMO Surveillance Site, South Africa
SO SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Background:The increasing prevalence of substance abuse in rural areas of Limpopo Province is a concern for most stakeholders including the families, South Africa Police Service, and social workers. Combating Substance Abuse requires the active roles of various stakeholders in the rural community, due to limited resources for prevention, treatment, and recovery. Purpose:To report on the roles of stakeholders in tackling Substance Abuse during the awareness campaign conducted in the deep rural community of Limpopo Province, DIMAMO surveillance area. Methods:Qualitative narrative design was adopted to explore the roles of stakeholders in combating Substance Abuse during the awareness campaign conducted in the deep rural community. The population consisted of different stakeholders who play an active role in reducing Substance Abuse. The triangulation method was used for data collection (interviews, observations, and taking field notes during presentations). Purposive sampling was used to select all the available stakeholders who actively combat substance abuse in the communities. Thematic narrative analysis was used to analyze the interviews conducted with and content presented by the stakeholders to generate the themes. Results:The prevalence of Substance Abuse among the youth in the Dikgale community is high with a growing trend of Crystal Meth, "nyaope," and Cannabis(marijuana). The prevalence is worsened by the diverse challenges experienced by the families and stakeholders which impact the strategies targeted to combat Substance Abuse. Conclusion:The findings indicated the need for strong collaborations among the stakeholders (including school leadership) to successfully combat Substance Abuse in rural areas. The findings demonstrated a need for a well-capacitated healthcare services with adequate rehabilitation centers and well-trained healthcare providers for combating Substance Abuse to minimize victim stigmatization.

TI A typology of families with parental alcohol or drug abuse
SO ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY
AB Objectives To estimate the prevalence of parental alcohol abuse (PAA) or parental drug abuse (PDA), to compare families with PAA/PDA to non-PAA/PDA families, and to identify different types of families with PAA/PDA in terms of mental disorders in parents, family separation, financial difficulties and educational level. Methods Register-based data from a complete birth cohort of children born in 1991 in Finland (N = 62,751), and their biological parents. Data were derived from Finnish administrative registers from 1991 to 2009. Latent class analysis was used to construct typology of families with PAA/PDA. Results 10.5% of families were affected by PAA or PDA before the children's 18th birthday. Of these families, five family types were identified. The most common type was characterised by father's alcohol abuse but had no other detectable problems besides parental separation. The second type was a family where the father had a drinking or drug problem, had financial difficulties and had moved away from the family's home. The two less common family types were characterised by the mother's drinking or drug abuse and mental disorders. The mothers of these family types were rather commonly living with their children. In the fifth family type, child typically did not live with either of the parents, both parents had alcohol/drug abuse and accumulated problems. Conclusions Early prevention and treatment are needed to avoid the accumulation of parental problems in PAA/PDA families. As both biological parents rather rarely were substance abusers, the parental role of the non-substance abusing parent should be supported and strengthened.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Studies of adolescents and adults have reported high levels of co-occurrence of substance abuse with other psychiatric disorders, suggesting influence between the conditions. The comorbidity seems complex and variable, indicating that there may be more than I type of association between the comorbid disorders. When occurring in childhood, some of the frequently comorbid psychopathologies typically precede later drug and alcohol abuse and may have implications for substance abuse prevention as early risk indicators and as targets for intervention. Research discussed in this article and in this special issue provides a foundation for investigating the question of whether effective treatment of childhood psychopathologies can prevent or at least mitigate substance abuse for some adolescents. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed.

TI HIV testing and sero-prevalence among methamphetamine users seeking
   substance abuse treatment in Cape Town
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
AB Introduction and AimsMethamphetamine use is highly prevalent in parts of South Africa, and there is concern this will contribute to the country's substantial HIV epidemic. We examined the feasibility of implementing routine HIV testing at a community-based substance abuse treatment centre in Cape Town and determined the HIV sero-prevalence among methamphetamine users seeking treatment at this site.
   Design and MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 293 participants completed measures of demographics, substance use and HIV treatment. HIV sero-prevalence was determined by a rapid finger-prick HIV test, and prior HIV diagnosis was confirmed via clinic records.
   ResultsThe majority of participants were male and self-identified as Coloured', with a mean age of 28years. The HIV sero-prevalence was 3.8%. Of the 11 participants who tested HIV positive, four were newly diagnosed. HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants were comparable on demographic and substance use factors. Uptake of HIV testing among all clients at the drug treatment centre increased from <5% prior to study initiation to 89% after study completion. Measures implemented to ensure high rates of HIV testing were regarded as sustainable.
   Discussion and ConclusionsOur study suggests that integrating routine HIV testing into substance abuse treatment is feasible in a community-based health centre. The low HIV prevalence among this sample of treatment-seeking methamphetamine users highlights the potential benefits of supporting expanded efforts to optimise HIV prevention with this young adult population.

TI National HIV/AIDS mortality, prevalence, and incidence rates are
   associated with the Human Development Index
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB Background: HIV/AIDS is a worldwide threat to human health with mortality, prevalence, and incidence rates varying widely. We evaluated the association between the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and national socioeconomic development.
   Methods: We obtained global age-standardized HIV/AIDS mortality, prevalence, and incidence rates from World Health Statistics Report of the World Health Organization. The human development indexes (HDIs) of 141 countries were obtained from a Human Development Report. Countries were divided into 4 groups according to the HDI distribution. We explored the association between HIV/AIDS epidemic and HDI information using Spearman correlation analysis, regression analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
   Results: HIV/AIDS mortality, prevalence, and incidence rates were inversely correlated with national HDI (r = -0.675, -0.519, and -0.398, respectively; P < .001), as well as the 4 indicators of HDI (ie, life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and gross national income per capita). Low HDI countries had higher HIV/AIDS mortality, prevalence, and incidence rates than that of medium, high, and very high HDI countries. Quantile regression results indicated that HDI had a greater negative effect on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in countries with more severe HIV/AIDS epidemic.
   Conclusions: Less-developed countries are likely to have more severe HIV/AIDS epidemic. There is a need to pay more attention to HIV/AIDS control in less-developed countries, where lower socioeconomic status might have accelerated the HIV/AIDS epidemic more rapidly.

TI Urbanization and hospital admission rates for alcohol and drug abuse: a
   follow-up study of 4.5 million women and men in Sweden
SO ADDICTION
AB Aims This study analyses whether the level of urbanization is associated with hospital admissions for alcohol and drug abuse, after adjustment for individual demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
   Design Follow-up study from 31 December 1996 to 31 December 1999.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants The entire Swedish population aged 25-64 yeras, in total 4.5 million women and men.
   Measurements Hospital admission rates for alcohol abuse (12 812 events) and drug abuse (6459 events). Level of urbanization was defined by population density and divided into quintiles. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the data.
   Findings The results showed an apparent gradient for both women and men; with increasing level of urbanization the hospital admission rates for alcohol abuse and drug abuse increased sharply. After adjustment for age, marital status, education and immigrant status, the hazard ratios for hospital admission for alcohol abuse were 1.76 [confidence interval (CI) = 1.58-1.96] for women and 1.71 (CI=1.60-1.82) for men in the most densely populated areas (quintile 5). For drug abuse the corresponding hazard ratios were 1.89 (CI = 1.67-2.15) for women and 2.38 (CI = 2.12-2.67) for men.
   Conclusions A high level Of urbanization was associated with increased hospital admission rates for alcohol abuse and drug abuse. The level of urbanization should be considered in the distribution of resources for prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.

TI Screening for parental substance abuse in pediatric primary care
SO AMBULATORY PEDIATRICS
AB Objective.-Parental alcohol and drug abuse may have significant deleterious effects on children. Although screening in the pediatric office is recommended, few screening measures have been evaluated for use in this setting. We sought to validate a 2-question screening tool for parental substance abuse.
   Methods.-A total of 216 caregivers bringing children to a primary care clinic completed a brief screening for psychosocial problems that contained 2 substance abuse questions. To assess reliability and validity of the questionnaire, recruited caregivers returned within 2 months to complete a computerized study protocol that contained the brief screening questions and the substance abuse sections of the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory (CIDI).
   Results.-Sixteen percent of caregivers acknowledged a problem with drugs or alcohol on the CIDI. A "yes" response to either screening question had a sensitivity of 29%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 17%, and negative predictive value of 98% for drug abuse. Values were 13%, 96%, 33%, and 87%, respectively for predicting alcohol abuse.
   Conclusions.-Brief screening in pediatric primary care can identify many, but not all, parents who may need intervention for problems with drugs and/or alcohol. Children should benefit from such screening if it enables parents to acknowledge and receive treatment for substance abuse. Further research is needed to assess whether sensitivity of screening can be improved without sacrificing brevity.

TI Treating antisocial behavior: A context for substance abuse prevention
SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB A large body of literature illustrates an association between antisocial behavior and substance abuse. In the present paper, this association is reviewed from a behavioral-economic standpoint. It is suggested that childhood antisocial behavior is a behavioral complement of substance abuse, and that prosocial behavior is a substitute for substance abuse. Based on this formulation, efforts to reduce or prevent antisocial behavior may be conceptualized as prevention programs for substance abuse. Four empirically supported approaches for the treatment of antisocial behavior are reviewed with respect to their promise for preventing and treating substance abuse. Taken together, they suggest that successful interventions for substance abuse may occur at various points over the course of development, beginning in infancy and extending into adolescence.

TI A developmental model of substance abuse in early adulthood
SO KINDHEIT UND ENTWICKLUNG
AB Development of a longitudinal model of the genesis of substance abuse in 25-year olds with special consideration of preceding mental disorders. Epidemiological longitudinal study (research at ages 8, 13, 18, and 25 years; n=321): Structured assessment of substance abuse (nicotine, alcohol, illegal drugs), psychopathology, psychosocial; and biological risk factors. The strongest predictor of substance abuse in early adulthood is the existence of addictive behavior at age 18 years: Addiction at age 18 years can be predicted by psychosocial risk factors and especially by preceding externalizing disorders. Transactional processes between these variables could be detected. Controlling for conduct disorders, hyperkinetic symptoms at all research ages additionally contribute to the prediction of nicotine abuse at age 25 years. The same could be found for hyperkinetic symptoms of 13-year-olds for later alcohol abuse. Additionally, obesity at age 8, 13, and 18 years proved to be a strong predictor of substance abuse at age 25 years.' Early detection and effective treatment of externalizing disorders simultaneously reduces the risk for substance abuse in early adulthood and can be seen as a powerful method of addiction prevention. Obesity in childhood and adolescence proved to be a risk factor for later substance abuse and must be considered for selective prevention trials.

TI Numerical investigations of stochastic HIV/AIDS infection model
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this paper, a stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model has been studied numerically. A discussion among the solutions related to deterministic HIV/AIDS model and stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model has shown that the stochastic solution is more realistic than the deterministic solution. To control the diseases, the threshold parameter R-0 plays a key role in the stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model. If R-0 < 1 then disease is under control while the disease is out of control if R-0 > 1. The explicit approaches such as the Milstein scheme, stochastic Euler scheme, and stochastic Runge-Kutta 4 are dependent on temporal step size, whereas non-standard finite difference approaches are independent of step size. The results for numerical approaches like the Milstein scheme, stochastic Euler scheme, and stochastic Runge-Kutta 4 scheme fail for outsized step size. The stochastic non-standard finite difference scheme conserves dynamic features like confinedness, consistency and positivity. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TI Analysis of HIV/AIDS Epidemic and Socioeconomic Factors in Sub-Saharan
   Africa
SO ENTROPY
AB Sub-Saharan Africa has been the epicenter of the outbreak since the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) began to be prevalent. This article proposes several regression models to investigate the relationships between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and socioeconomic factors (the gross domestic product per capita, and population density) in ten countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, for 2011-2016. The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the unknown parameters of these models along with the Newton-Raphson procedure and Fisher scoring algorithm. Comparing these regression models, there exist significant spatiotemporal non-stationarity and auto-correlations between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and two socioeconomic factors. Based on the empirical results, we suggest that the geographically and temporally weighted Poisson autoregressive (GTWPAR) model is more suitable than other models, and has the better fitting results.

The second project is integrating the Community Reinforcement Approach for adults into Multisystemic Therapy (MST) programs for use with substance-abusing caregivers. The third project is integrating Reinforcement-Based Therapy for adults with MST for child abuse and neglect in the treatment of families with co-occurring child maltreatment and caregiver substance abuse. Each project highlights the complexity of using the evidence base in the treatment of substance abuse, and the potential to improve outcomes for challenging clinical populations in real world practice settings.

TI Substance abuse and suicide risk among adolescents
SO EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB The aim of this paper was to review the literature concerning the relationship between suicide and substance abuse behaviours among adolescents, focusing on epidemiology, comorbidity and preventive programmes. We performed a Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, PsycLit and PsycInfo search to identify all papers and book chapters during the period between 1980 and 2011. Adolescents with substance abuse disorder who attempt or complete suicide can be characterized as having mood disorders, stressful life events, interpersonal problems, poor social support, lonely lives and feelings of hopelessness. The research supports the existence of a strong relationship between suicide and substance abuse. Preventive programmes should be based on the detection of risk factors associated with both suicide and substance abuse disorder. Management programmes should combine different therapeutic strategies such as peer-to-peer education, school-based programmes, psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment. Evidence suggests that targeted suicide prevention programmes can be delivered which reduce the burden associated with substance abuse and suicide in youths.

TI Global partnerships to support noncommunicable disease care in low and
   middle-income countries: lessons from HIV/AIDS
SO AIDS
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to identify lessons learned from partnerships addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic that can inform those needed to mitigate the noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) epidemic in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Design: We selected and analysed a convenience sample of organizational partnerships developed to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in LMICs, focusing on their specific strategies and contributions.
   Methods: A review of published literature and website information pertaining to a convenience sample of five global organizations and/or types of partnerships that provide support to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic was qualitatively analysed to assess key areas of support provided to scale-up services in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
   Results: Six topical areas of support were identified: HIV/AIDS service delivery; enhancing comprehensive health systems capacity; operational and implementation science research to improve care delivery; introducing and improving the availability of new products; political advocacy; and early-stage planning for sustainability and transition to more independent implementing-country delivery programmes. These six areas of support were qualitatively assessed for identify a focus, contributory or minimal contribution on the part of each of the organizations and/or types of partnerships reviewed.
   Conclusion: No single global partnership addresses the range of support needed to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and this will likely be true for an effective response to the emerging NCD epidemic. A range of coordinated financial and/or technical support as well as lessons learned from global HIV/AIDS partnerships will be key to achieving an effective response to the global NCD epidemic.

TI Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment in the Military: Lessons
   Learned and a Way Forward
SO MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY
AB Articles in this issue, "Stigma as a Barrier to Treatment," provide an excellent overview of the challenges associated with the treatment of substance abuse and mental health disorders in military settings. The issue serves to document substance abuse rates in the military; identify factors that influence and impede entry and participation in treatment, negative beliefs about treatment, and factors influencing perceived stigma; and examine the acceptability and feasibility of new substance abuse treatment models being employed at three Army installations. Two overarching conclusions can be made from the articles in this issue. First, the problems, barriers, and stigma associated with substance abuse and mental health disorders are not unique to military settings. Second, the military setting has unique characteristics that may help to destigmatize substance abuse and mental health problems, remove barriers to treatment, and facilitate access to military members to deal with substance abuse and mental health problems. In this article, we review similarities among military and civilian populations with respect to substance abuse and mental health problems; highlight strategies to reduce substance abuse among individuals in military service; and identify unique opportunities to improve substance abuse and mental health services within the military settings.

TI Diversity of HIV/AIDS epidemic in China: a result from hierarchical
   clustering analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis
SO AIDS
AB Objective: To find out the diversity of HIV/AIDS epidemic among different areas in China according to their varied epidemic characteristics.
   Design and methods: Seventeen provincial variables, generated from original HIV/ AIDS epidemic data and socioeconomic indicators to indicate HIV/AIDS epidemic characteristics, were introduced to hierarchical clustering analysis to form subepidemic areas. Then spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied to show the clustering distribution of cases from different most-at-risk populations.
   Results: Three HIV/AIDS subepidemic areas (A, B, C) were formed, each of which was further divided into two clusters, showing the diversity of HIV/AIDS epidemic in China. A1 was the earliest and severest HIV/AIDS epidemic area and occupied 37% hotspot counties. The epidemic in A1 was driven by IDU in its early period and heterosexual transmission later. Henan, the only province in A2, characterized by its HIV/AIDS epidemic among former plasma donors during the early 1990s, presented strong spatial clustering of blood/plasma transmission occupying 80% blood/plasma hotspots. The epidemic within B3, located in southwest China, was driven by IDU and heterosexual populations, and recently by MSM. The epidemic within B4, covering all four municipalities, had been largely spread among MSM since 2005. B3 and B4 occupied 76% MSM hotspots. For C5 and C6, only sporadic HIV/AIDS infections occurred in the last years among former plasma donors and heterosexual populations, whereas the prevalence among MSM had been increasing.
   Conclusion: China's different HIV/AIDS subepidemic areas had obvious diversity of affected populations, which should be considered when determining prevention policies. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

AB Correlates of substance abuse disorders in teenagers may suggest new treatment modalities. The present article examines correlates of self-reported substance abuse and dependence among a sample of 1936 youth at high risk for drug abuse, from 21 southern California continuation high schools. Among 32 demographic, drug use, drug use intention, coping, or health attitude-related variables, gender, cigarette smoking, anger coping, depression, and addiction concern were most consistently associated with self-reported substance abuse or substance dependence. These results suggest that affect management may help facilitate the prevention or control of adolescent drug abuse.

TI Adverse childhood experiences and personal alcohol abuse as an adult
SO ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
AB Adult alcohol abuse has been linked to childhood abuse and family dysfunction. However, little information is available about the contribution of multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in combination with parental alcohol abuse, to the risk of later alcohol abuse. A questionnaire about childhood abuse, parental alcoholism and family dysfunction while growing up was completed by adult HMO members in order to retrospectively assess the independent relationship of eight ACES to the risk of adult alcohol abuse. The number of ACES was used in stratified logistic regression models to assess their impact on several adult alcohol problems in the presence or absence of parental alcoholism. Each of the eight individual ACEs was associated with a higher risk alcohol abuse as an adult. Compared to persons with no ACES, the risk of heavy drinking, self-reported alcoholism, and marrying an alcoholic were increased twofold to fourfold by the presence of multiple ACES, regardless of parental alcoholism. Prevention of ACES and treatment of persons affected by them may reduce the occurrence of adult alcohol problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB Adolescent drug addiction and alcohol abuse are on the rise in this country. Teenagers of all races, socioeconomic groups and both genders have become avid experimenters with a full spectrum of substances, including alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, cocaine and hallucinogens. A diagnosis of addiction requires familiarity with the normative trends of adolescent behavior, as well as deviations from these trends. Moreover, an adolescent mother with a drug addiction problem confronts the additional burden of fostering adaptive developmental patterns in her infant. Treatment techniques such as previewing, which empowers through the representation and enactment of future outcomes, have helped addicted teenage mothers relinquish drug use and adopt more mature caregiving behaviors.

AB Background: The data of substance abuse are limited in Iraq. Psychiatrists perceived non-medical use of prescription drugs, including benzhexol (muscle relaxant), benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication), and codeine (opiate painkiller), as the most common form of illicit substance use.
   Aim of the: study: This study was designed to assess the substance - abuse - related knowledge and attitude among the youth in Tikrit.
   Results: Results showed that 78% didn't know any substance abusers while 22 knew at least one substance abuser. Also, a sizeable number of females and males(57.4%) were not able to define substance abuse correctly. Avoiding friends who are substance abusers can help in the prevention of substance abuse" was the most agreed upon factor for the prevention of substance abuse among males (82.5%) and females (85.7%). A percentage of females (84.6%) and males (70.2%) wary of those who used illegal substances. Also, females (76.9%) and males(68.2%) tended to avoid drug addicts.
   Conclusion: Both genders did not have enough knowledge about globally and locally used illicit substances. Negative attitudes toward substance abusers and substance abuse were clearly apparent in their responses. The youth agreed with spending as much money as possible on the treatment of substance abusers. The population showed good know, ledge about the ways and factors that may help in the prevention of substance abuse.

TI Criminally violent victimisation in schizophrenia spectrum disorders:
   the relationship to symptoms and substance abuse
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Violent victimisation among people with major mental illness is well-documented but the risk factors for criminal violent victimisation are not well understood.
   Methods: We examined the relationship between illness-related variables, indices of substance abuse and previous history of violence in a sample of 23 male criminally violently victimized and 69 non-criminally violently victimized male patients with DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder that were resident in the community and in contact with public mental health services in Victoria Australia. Data on criminal victimisation was acquired from the police database.
   Results: Demographic, a history of violence or illness-related variables did not distinguish between those had been the victim of a violent crime and those who had not. Our data indicated that drug abuse was a key factor in distinguishing between the groups, but the age of onset of substance abuse was not a significant factor. Scores on measures of drug abuse were modest predictors of criminal victimisation status in our Receiver Operator Characteristic analyses.
   Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that substance abuse (particularly drug abuse) is a key predictor of violent victimisation based on criminal statistics. The latter has implications for mental health professions involved in the care planning and community management of patients with major mental illness and work points to the importance of substance abuse treatment in the prevention of victimisation as well as violence perpetration.

AB Since 1993, 14 American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities have worked diligently to reduce the harm due to substance abuse in their communities: Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthy Nations Initiative 1, these communities implemented creative strategies that span the continuum from community-wide prevention, early identification and treatment to aftercare. Drawing upon the unique strengths of their own cultural traditions to find solutions to local substance abuse problems, these efforts have identified important and useful lessons for not only other AIAN communities, but also for sponsors of substance abuse programming in Indian country and elsewhere. Described here are successful strategies for developing and sustaining substance abuse programs in AIAN communities and an assessment of their impacts and accomplishments.

TI Pubertal Timing and Substance Abuse Treatment Outcomes: An Analysis of
   Early Menarche on Substance Use Patterns
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD & ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
AB This article examines the influence of pubertal timing on substance use patterns, specifically the relationship between onset of menarche and onset of substance use and substance abuse treatment outcomes. Findings show a significant relationship between pubertal timing and age of onset of substance use and age of onset of substance use and substance use severity at intake into treatment. The article concludes with a call for further research into the possible relationship between pubertal timing and treatment outcomes as well as effective gender-specific interventions for prevention and treatment of substance abuse among adolescent girls.

TI Determinants of Substance Abuse in a Population of Children and
   Adolescents Involved with the Child Welfare System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
AB Substance abuse is an important health issue facing children involved with child welfare, but little is known about the associated factors. The purpose of this study was to build on findings from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect-2003 and use a national sample of 10-15 year old children to examine the factors associated with substance abuse for all investigations and substantiated investigations of maltreatment. Our findings showed that almost 14% of all investigated children were abusing substances and that this proportion was even greater among those whose investigation of maltreatment had been substantiated (almost 16%). The severity of the experienced maltreatment, in addition to behavioural factors, was found to be associated with substance abuse. While the pathways to substance abuse are complex, understanding the risk factors associated with substance abuse in this population are important for targeted interventions for prevention and treatment.

TI Tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs: The role of the pediatrician in
   prevention, identification, and management of substance abuse
SO PEDIATRICS
AB Substance abuse remains a major public health concern, and pediatricians are uniquely positioned to assist their patients and families with its prevention, detection, and treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has highlighted the importance of such issues in a variety of ways, including its guidelines for preventive services. The harmful consequences of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use are a concern of medical professionals who care for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. Thus, pediatricians should include discussion of substance abuse as a part of routine health care, starting with the prenatal visit, and as part of ongoing anticipatory guidance. Knowledge of the nature and extent of the consequences of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use as well as the physical, psychological, and social consequences is essential for pediatricians. Pediatricians should incorporate substance-abuse prevention into daily practice, acquire the skills necessary to identify young people at risk of substance abuse, and provide or facilitate assessment, intervention, and treatment as necessary.

TI Alcohol abuse and depression in children and adolescents
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD & ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
AB This study examines gender differences in patterns of the co-occurrence of alcohol abuse and depression in youth. Data were from 1,458 youth (ages 9-17) randomly selected from the community. The child and one parent/guardian in each household were interviewed regarding childhood psychopathology, alcohol and drug use, and a wide array of risk factors. The findings showed that: (1) alcohol abuse/dependence was associated with elevated rates of depression in youth; (2) comorbidity between depression and alcohol use/abuse could be partially explained by shared risk factors; and (3) gender differences were found in the patterns of comorbidity. After controlling for other factors, the relationship between depression and alcohol abuse/dependence was no longer significant for girls, but it remained significant for boys. Among girls, however, cigarette smoking emerged as significantly related to depression. In the prevention of substance abuse and the treatment of depressive and addictive disorders. comorbidity of alcohol abuse and depression should be taken into account. Other clinical and policy implications are also discussed.

TI Meeting the substance abuse treatment needs of lesbian, bisexual and
   transgender women: implications from research to practice
SO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND REHABILITATION
AB Research on the incidence, etiology and substance abuse treatment needs of lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LBT) women is limited. Most research indicates higher levels of alcohol and drug abuse among these populations compared to their heterosexual counterparts, with recent research indicating that substance abuse is a particular concern for transgender individuals and an increasing problem among younger LBT individuals. Risk factors and reasons for substance abuse among sexual minority women are similar to those of heterosexual women, yet are substantially complicated by issues of family rejection and lack of social support, stigma and minority stress, as well as abuse and harassment. Historically, substance abuse prevention, early intervention, and clinical treatment programs were designed to meet the needs of the sexual majority population with relatively few programs designed to incorporate the specific needs of sexual minorities. This article reviews findings from previous studies and utilizes new data collected from community-based and residential substance abuse treatment programs to (1) examine issues relevant to LBT women and substance use, and (2) make recommendations for tailoring substance abuse treatment programs to meet the needs of these populations.

AB This study evaluated whether there were increasing admissions for illicit drug abuse treatment among older persons from 1992 to 2005 in the United States and describes the characteristics, number, and type of substances most commonly abused in this population over this 14-year period. Analyses used public data files from the Treatment Episode Data Set, which tracks federally and state funded substance abuse treatment admissions. From 1992 to 2005, admissions for illicit drug abuse increased significantly; in 2005, 61% of admissions age 50 to 54 years old and 45% of admissions age 55 years and older reported some type of illicit drug abuse, most commonly heroin or cocaine abuse. Criminal justice referrals for drug abuse admissions have increased over time and daily substance use remains high. Efforts to determine best practices for prevention, identification, and treatment of illicit drug abuse in older persons are indicated.

At the first stage the high priority was given to biological surveillance; very soon it was clear that behavioural surveillance should be strenghtened. Due to integration of both types of HIV surveillance it was predicted the commence of the HIV epidemic in Estonia. In February, 2001 it was proclaimed the concentrated HIV epidemic among IDUs in Eastern Estonia which rapidly enfolded the IDU sub-population in capital Tallinn.

Such stresses may heighten adolescents' vulnerability to drug abuse. This article documents the extent of drug use in a sample of 200 US.-born Asian Indian adolescents. According to the study participants' self-reports on lifetime use, 28 percent had used alcohol on at least one occasion, 165 percent had used cigarettes, and 2.5 percent had used marijuana. Adolescents who placed importance on their parents' drug abuse prevention messages tended not to use drugs. The implications of the study's findings for drug abuse assessment, treatment, and prevention are discussed.

For over two decades, cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention has become incorporated into substance abuse treatment by offering a specific perspective on relapse and a set of strategies aimed at maintaining behavioral change over the long haul and to reduce the impact of the fall should a slip occur. We first review Marlatt's original relapse prevention model, followed by an overview of substance abuse relapse prevention treatment outcome literature and review of studies testing components of the original model.

AB This study aimed to determine the impact of international travellers (tourists) on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. A compartmental epidemic model was extended to include the effect of tourists on the spread of HIV/AIDS. Nonlinear ordinary differential equations were used to describe the rate of change in the number of individuals in the respective compartments. Tourists are defined as travellers who leave their country for a period of time. The reproduction number was calculated to provide new insight into the spread of HIV/AIDS. The results indicated that the constant flow of tourists into a country increases the spread of these diseases, although it does not change the status of the HIV/AIDS spread from endemic to epidemic.

In recent controlled trials, behavioral prevention programs have been shown to reduce alcohol use in collegiate student athletes who are at-risk for alcohol abuse, with outcomes appearing to be enhanced when family members are prescriptively involved. However, no interventions have been found to decrease alcohol or drug use frequency in controlled trials involving athletes who have been diagnosed with substance abuse, and no prescribed clinical interventions for substance abuse have been tailored to accommodate the unique needs of competitive athletes. As an initial step in this development, we review an evidenced-supported behavioral treatment program modified for use with athletes. Optimizing the support of significant others, this innovative treatment approach comprehensively targets multiple areas of mental health while emphasizing cultural enlightenment. Recommendations are offered, including the great need for controlled treatment outcome research specific to substance abuse in athletes.

TI A community-based organization's integration of HIV and substance abuse
   treatment services for ex-offenders
SO SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE
AB This paper explores,the point of intersection of the substance abuse treatment and HIV services industries with the criminal justice system. Section I reviews the literature and "best practices'' that have integrated substance abuse treatment and HIV care and prevention services for ex-offenders and which informed the development of a community based organization's initiative, the VIP STRIVE Project. Section II presents a brief history of VIP in the context of its ability to adapt to its environment and to the changing needs of its target population, with specific reference to the development of HIV and substance abuse treatment services for members of the criminal justice population. The concluding section brings the two previous sections together by explaining how the VIP STRIVE Project can assist VIP in enhancing its capacity to integrate its substance abuse treatment and HIV services in order to improve services for this target population.

TI The mover-stayer model for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in action
SO INTERFACES
AB Short- and medium-term projections of the HIV/AIDS epidemic indicators are of great interest to those evaluating the needs for health care and prevention interventions. We developed a simulation procedure to obtain forecasts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and used it to estimate the characteristic regional parameters of the epidemic in Italy. The simulation procedure is based on a hybrid compartmental model, in which the epidemic evolves via nonrandom mixing patterns. Because of its structure, the model is suitable for policy making; in particular, for evaluating prevention campaigns, alternate forms of health care for people with AIDS, and drug supply-needs. The model will also be used to estimate the number of intravenous drug users in Italy and the number of AIDS cases not reported or reported with a delay to the Italian surveillance system.

TI HIV/AIDS epidemiology and prevention in China
SO CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objective To review HIV/AIDS epidemic history, current situation and prevention policy in China.
   Data sources Information included in this article was identified by searching PUBMED (1997-2006) online resources using the key terms "HIV/AIDS", "epidemic", "prevention", and "China".
   Study selection Original milestone articles and critical reviews written by major pioneer investigators of the field were selected.
   Results The key issues related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic situation in China and Chinese government prevention policy were summarized. HIV/AIDS epidemic groups and trends for HIV transmission were discussed.
   Conclusion In January 2006, 650 000 people were estimated to be living with HIV in China. The overall HIV/AIDS epidemic is at a low level (0.05%) and concentrated in several at risk populations. However, the data show that new cases of HIV infection are growing every year and spreading from at risk populations to the general population. Premier WEN Jia-bao announced the "Four frees and one care" policy and the Chinese government has developed a series of programs with strong policy measures to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in China.

TI MEMORY IS AN ACT OF LOVE: POETICS OF THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC IN PUERTO
   RICO
SO ROMANCE NOTES
AB In recent years, scholars have been interested in the representation of health and disease in latin american literary texts. although sickness is a phenomenon that takes place in the present and affects a particular body, patients look back to their past in order to confer purposeful meaning to their suffering. similarly, when a particularly deathly disease disturbs a community, the collective memory can work as a means to understand the current situation and to lighten the struggles of the present, as it is depicted in Inmunologia poetica (2010) by moises agostorosario (puerto rico, 1965). in this paper, i explore how agosto-rosario's book challenges a common framework that understands the HIV/AIDS epidemic through a closed linear narrative that hides the epidemic's onset because it is full of images of gay transgressive sexuality. instead, the poetic speaker represents a queer poetics of the hiv/aids epidemic by relying on gay memory and latino cultural perspectives. in the poems that i analyze, memory, community, and love work together to resist the hegemonic view of the hiv/aids epidemic that highlights containment, oblivion, and death.

TI PrEP in substance abuse treatment: a qualitative study of treatment
   provider perspectives
SO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PREVENTION AND POLICY
AB Objectives: To examine substance abuse treatment providers' views on engaging clients in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) care and research trials.
   Methods: Thirty-six medical and counseling service providers in six New York City outpatient substance abuse treatment programs participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Thematic content analysis was conducted by three coders, independently.
   Results: Providers' perspectives toward PrEP were characterized by six salient themes: 1) Limited PrEP awareness. 2) Ambivalence about PrEP; 3) Perception of multiple challenges to delivery; 4) Uncertainty about clients' ability to be adherent to medication; 5) Concerns about medication safety/side effects; and 6) Perception of multiple barriers to conducting clinical trials.
   Conclusions: Despite anticipated challenges, providers supported the introduction of PrEP in outpatient substance abuse treatment. Comprehensive training for providers is needed and should include PrEP eligibility criteria, strategies to support adherence and medication monitoring guidelines. Linkages between substance abuse treatment and primary care and/or enhancement of capacity within clinics to offer PrEP may help facilitate PrEP delivery. When conducting research in outpatient clinics, it is particularly important to protect client confidentiality.

AB Previous research has documented a strong linkage between substance abuse and criminal activity among young offenders. Consequently, the provision of effective substance-abuse interventions for this population is of paramount importance to the criminal justice system. This article explores the literature on the treatment of substance abuse in offender and nonoffender populations. It reviews three major areas: pretreatment variables (eg, gender and psychopathology), in-treatment variables (eg, program targets, program setting, client-treatment matching), and posttreatment variables (eg, aftercare). The article concludes with a list of empirically derived guidelines for the effective development and implementation of substance-abuse treatment programs for adolescents.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB An original approach to simulation modeling of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is proposed. This approach uses survivor functions estimated from cohort studies conducted with seropositive and AIDS-diagnosed individuals. The model can be considered an alternative to the usual Markov models and accounts for time-dependent HIV progression to AIDS, and AIDS progression to death. By using various forms of survivor functions, it can also easily be extended to accommodate natural history events, as well as long-term survivors and cofactor effects, when appropriate data are available.

TI KNOWLEDGE AND VIEWS ON DRUG-ABUSE OF PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE WORKERS IN
   NIGERIA
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB Primary health care (PHC) in Nigeria (as in many developing countries) relies heavily on paramedical personnel. Using a self-report structured questionnaire design, 207 PHC workers were assessed on their knowledge and views about drug and alcohol abuse. PHC workers with previous exposure to some form of drug abuse training were significantly more likely to be aware of the correct usage for the term 'drug abuse', although the whole range of drugs of abuse/dependence was much less well appreciated. Drugs reported by the PHC workers to be commonly abused in the study area were in keeping with previous findings on drug abuse in the country. However, 75.4% of the PHC workers perceived drug abuse as a low grade problem, in contrast to recent reports, of the increasing magnitude of drug abuse problems in the country. About one fifth of PHC workers were of the opinion that drug abusers should be punished. Only 35 (16.9%) of those who indicated the need for treatment mentioned that this could be carried out by PHC personnel. Many of the PHC workers showed limited knowledge of factors associated with drug abuse and on the scope of preventive strategies against drug abuse. Suggestions are made on the short and long term training needs of the PHC workers in order to ensure the successful incorporation of drug abuse treatment and prevention programmes into the PHC programme in Nigeria.

TI Behavioral Treatment of Substance Abuse in Schizophrenia
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Co-occurring substance use disorders are highly prevalent among individuals with schizophrenia and other serious and persistent mental illnesses (SPMI) and are associated with clinically significant consequences. A multifaceted behavioral treatment called Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Serious and Persistent Mental Illness (BTSAS) can reduce substance abuse in persons with SPMI. The key treatment strategies in BTSAS include a urinalysis contingency, short-term goal setting, training in drug refusal skills, psychoeducation about the impact of drug use, and relapse prevention training. A case example illustrating the application of BTSAS is presented and relevant clinical issues are discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol: In Session 65: 831-841, 2009.

TI The Pathology of Drug Abuse in Elderly Women: A Qualitative Study
SO ADDICTIVE DISORDERS & THEIR TREATMENT
AB Objectives: One of the most challenging issues facing elderly women is drug abuse. There are different factors affecting the start and continuation of drug use; however, there has not been much research on this subject. Therefore, the present study was conducted to better explore the pathology of substance abuse among elderly women. Materials and Methods: The present research was a qualitative study of 22 elderly women living in Tehran, Iran, who had experience with drug abuse. The data were gathered utilizing semistructured questions during face-to-face interviews and analyzed by conventional content analysis. Results: The data analysis process resulted in 3 main categories: "the maze of addiction among elderly women," "the factors that extend drug abuse," and "addiction in elderly women: the bell of deprivation." Conclusions: There are a few practices that are helpful in decreasing the likelihood of substance abuse among elderly women, including using new pain control treatment methods for the elderly, increasing awareness of the side-effects of drug abuse, inducting the necessary cultural domination practices through group media to prevent breaking the norms of society, and ruling out misconceptions. Financial and emotional support by both family members and society to prevent certain issues, such as forced marriage to addicted men, can also be beneficial in drug addiction withdrawal or prevention among the studied group. Easy access to special withdrawal centers for women, as well as educational-consulting sessions for family members, at which religious principles are emphasized, can help prevent the development of drug abuse in elderly women.

TI Substance abuse and the family: An examination of the South African
   policy context
SO DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY
AB National policy documents are important platforms for the prioritisation of social issues which is likely to spur research into the development of evidence-based practice guidelines that are effective and cost-efficient. In relation to the impact of substance abuse on the family, carefully designed policies that magnify support for the family can help lessen the burden of substance abuse on families. Using the Family Impact Lens (FIL) framework, this paper explored how family issues in relation to substance abuse are addressed within three South African policy and strategic documents: the Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse (PTSA) Act (2008), the National drug master plan (NDMP; 2013-2017) and the White paper on families in South Africa (2012). In keeping with the framework of the FIL, we evaluated whether the policies (1) mention the effects of substance abuse on the family, (2) recognise the importance of the family in the relative's rehabilitation and (3) address the needs of family members by providing policy directives to support families who are affected by substance abuse (affected family members (AFMs)). Although all three policies recognise that families are negatively impacted by a relative's substance abuse, the policies are overly focussed on individual approaches to deal with substance abuse and fail to adequately address the support needs of AFMs. Research on the support needs of AFMs is warranted in addition to the evaluation or development of evidence-based strategies to support AFMs. Further implications and recommendations for policy-makers, researchers and practitioners are provided in the paper.

TI Stochastic dynamics of an HIV/AIDS epidemic model with treatment
SO QUAESTIONES MATHEMATICAE
AB We investigate a stochastic HIV/AIDS epidemic model with treatment. The model allows for two stages of infection namely the asymptomatic phase and the symptomatic phase. We prove existence of global positive solutions. We show that the solutions are stochastically ultimately bounded and stochastically permanent. We also study asymptotic behaviour of the solution to the stochastic model around the disease-free equilibrium of the underlying deterministic model. Our theoretical results are illustrated by way of numerical simulations.

TI Impulsive SUI epidemic model for HIV/AIDS with chronological age and
   infection age
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB This paper develops an impulsive SUI model of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(HIV/AIDS) epidemic for the first time to study the dynamic behavior of this model. The SUI model is described by impulsive partial differential equations. First, the well-posedness of the model is attained by the method of characteristic lines and iterative method. Secondly, the basic reproduction number R-0(q,T) of the epidemic which depends on the impulsive HIV-finding period T and the HIV-finding proportion q is obtained by mathematical analysis. Our result shows that HIV/AIDS epidemic can be theoretically eradicated if we can have the suitable HIV-finding proportion q and the impulsive HIV-finding period T such that R-0(q,T)<1. We also conjecture that the infection-free periodic solution of the SUI model is unstable when R-0(q,T)>1. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Culturally-Informed Interventions for Substance Abuse Among Indigenous
   Youth in the United States: A Review
SO JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-INFORMED SOCIAL WORK
AB Purpose: Given the disproportionately high levels of alcohol and other drug abuse among Indigenous youth in the United States, the purpose of this systematic review was to explicate the current state of empirically-based and culturally-informed substance abuse prevention and intervention programs for Indigenous youth (ages 9-18). Method: The 14 articles that met inclusion criteria for this review were analyzed both in terms of the cultural intervention itself (primary population, intervention, core tenants, focus of intervention, intervention goals, location, intervention location, and program length) and their evaluation approach. Results: Results indicate variable integration of cultural components with the majority of interventions taking place in schools and treatment facilities, targeting primarily individuals. Discussion: There is a current gap in research on culturally-informed substance abuse interventions for Indigenous youth, which this review begins to address. Promising areas of future research and interventions include bringing communities and families into treatment and prevention.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE IN THE ADDICTIONS
AB Despite increasing interest in "faith-based" substance abuse treatment and HIV risk reduction interventions, there is little systematic evidence of the efficacy of explicitly spiritual interventions. However, fundamental to effective interventions is an explicit conceptualization of mechanisms underlying behavior change. This paper discusses the definition of faith-based organizations, specifically as they relate to substance abuse treatment programs, briefly reviews relevant behavior change theories to identify key variables underlying change, presents an integrative conceptual framework articulating linkages between spiritual intervention components, behavior change processes and substance abuse outcomes, and discusses how the mechanisms identified in our model can be seen in commonly used substance abuse interventions. Overall, the paper suggests that what happens in "faith-based" programs different from processes taking place in good social work practice in the addictions field.different from processes taking place in good social work practice in the addictions field.

TI DRUG-ABUSE AND ITS CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
   NIGERIA
SO CENTRAL AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB A review of the literature shows that drug abuse has become a major public health problem in Nigeria.  Alcohol, cannabis, psychostimulants and hypnosedatives are the most commonly abused drugs, although the abuse of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin appears to be on the increase in the big cities.  Drug abuse in the country now starts at an early age and cuts across all social groups.
   The need to incorporate drug and alcohol treatment and prevention programmes into the primary health care programmes (as part of the mental health component), was emphasised as a necessary strategy to ensure early detection and management, and a better coverage of the population of patients in need of care.  It was also suggested that there is an urgent need to encourage extensive epidemiological and longitudinal studies of drug and alcohol abuse in Nigeria in order to accurately determine the populations at risk, the changing patterns of abuse over time (including cross-cultural comparison), and to allow for adequate social monitoring, planning and evaluation of services.

TI Pharmaceuticals and the worldwide HIV epidemic: Can a stakeholder model

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
AB The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic has generated intense criticism of pharmaceutical drug prices, a natural consequence of the industry's unique cost structure. Many people have proposed that the industry adopt what might be called a stakeholder model in place of the traditional profit-driven model. However, the rapid drop in HIV drug prices, combined with generic entry and de facto abandonment of patent rights, has revealed the extremely limited role of drug prices and access in the face of fundamental problems in infrastructure, prevention, and other essential elements in battling HIVIAIDS. Adoption of a stakeholder approach is likely to undermine essential research and development while doing little to curtail the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Predictors of Accessing Substance Abuse Services Among Individuals With
   Mental Disorders Released From Correctional Custody
SO JOURNAL OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective: In the context of an increasing correctional population and corresponding rates of mental illness and substance abuse among this population, this study focuses on describing the predictors of substance abuse service utilization for ex-inmates with dual disorders. Our aim is to assess the likelihood and characteristics of ex-inmates with mental disorders who access substance abuse treatment services within 2years of correctional release. Methods: Using merged administrative data on all ex-inmates with open mental health cases released from the Massachusetts Department of Corrections and two county houses of corrections from 2007 to 2009 (N = 2,280) and substance abuse treatment outcome data through 2011, we analyze the influence of demographics, behavioral and mental disorders, and criminal justice variables on entry into substance abuse treatment within 24 months post-release. We also describe primary drug use and services utilized for all the ex-inmates who accessed substance abuse services (n = 1,383). Regression techniques were used to analyze the probability of utilizing substance abuse treatment services by various demographic, behavioral, and criminal involvement characteristics. Results: The prevalence of a history of substance use disorders is high in this population (69%, n = 1,285). Subsequently, at 24 months post release, 61% (n = 1,383) of ex-inmates with open mental health cases utilized substance abuse treatment services. This group was disproportionately female and White, with a preincarceration history of substance abuse and an increased number of previous incarcerations, and was more likely released under correctional supervision. Conclusions: Substance abuse is a chronic relapsing disorder and dual diagnosis is common among individuals with mental disorders involved with the criminal justice system. Their service needs and contacts across substance abuse, mental health, and criminal justice systems highlight individuals caught up in the institutional circuit. Study results point to the need for expanded and targeted dual diagnosis treatment approaches and relapse prevention for ex-inmates with mental disorders post correctional release.

AB Recreational drug abuse (RDA) is a commonly encountered clinical problem that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has resulted in a continuous steady increase in usage, morbidity, and mortality over the last two decades. The clinical picture of RDA is often opaque due to its extensive range of clinical presentation. As the problem becomes more widespread and many patients withhold a history of RDA, the radiologist frequently is first to note and suggest the possibility of RDA. Familiarity with the radiologic manifestations of RDA is critical to provide accurate diagnosis with a succinct differential diagnosis and to allow for prompt treatment of patients with this potentially fatal condition.

TI New features of the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in
   China
SO EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
AB Men who have sex with men (MSM) have accounted for an alarmingly increasing proportion of nationally reported human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) cases recently. While the latest HIV epidemic among this population was not well understood, the underlying reasons for the rapid increase of the HIV epidemic were even more rarely evaluated. This study reviewed all published articles and national surveillance data in recent years to analyze the new HIV epidemic among MSM in China, and this study finally concluded that a culture of risky sexual behaviors, low adoption of HIV testing and a high prevalence of syphilis infection were the major risk factors that predominantly facilitate homosexual HIV transmission. Both HIV infection and homosexuality remain highly stigmatized in China, which further exacerbates attempts at HIV prevention and control. A great deal of work still needs to be done for the national policy makers, programming, research and clinical sectors to help curb the HIV epidemic among Chinese MSM.

The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. It is found that if the threshold R-0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and if the threshold R-0 > 1, the system is permanent and the endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable under certain conditions.

SO AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
AB Empirical studies of American Indian health and mental health have focused primarily on reservation samples or small cross-sectional school-based or treatment samples. Few studies have addressed these issues among urban American Indian populations. This paper introduces an ongoing ten-year prospective longitudinal study of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and mental health status in a community sample of urban American Indian adolescents and women. The study uses structured interviews and diagnostic assessments to identify risk factors for, and measure prevalence of, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and psychopathology in 523 Indian youth and 276 Indian women. Study aims, rationale, research design, methods, sample characteristics, assessment instruments, and substance use prevalence are described, and methodological issues related to conducting longitudinal research are discussed.

TI Partner violence and substance abuse: Treatment interventions
SO AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
AB Partner violence is a serious public health issue. For couples who enter treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, rates of partner aggression are alarmingly high, with 53% to 63% of couples reporting one or more episodes of partner violence in the year prior to program entry (Murphy & O'Farrell, 1994; Murphy, O'Farrell, Fals-Stewart, & Feeham, 2001; Stuart et al., 2003). Indeed, one of the most challenging clinical issues faced by therapists who treat substance-abusing patients is intimate partner violence (IPV). This review describes the link between substance abuse (alcohol and drug) and partner violence and identifies treatment strategies for providers working with these clients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on a public health model, three types of strategies to prevent drug abuse can be discerned: primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention programs (anticipation and prevention of the occurrence of drug abuse) have mostly been directed to elementary grade school children in general. As knowledge about genetic predisposition increases, early developmental periods are increasingly plastic, and substance abuse is now beginning at earlier ages. Prophylactic interventions need to focus on childhood high-risk groups. With respect to secondary prevention (aiming at the discontinuation of infrequent drug-use) the stage (or stepping-stone) hypothesis is currently being challenged. Continuation is mainly a function of the type of drug as well as social and personality factors. Progression to higher-rank drugs depends mainly on the intensity of prior drug use. Comorbid psychiatric diseases are increasingly recognized and tractable. As in primary prevention the focus of secondary prevention shifts from sociocultural influences to the individual at risk. Regarding tertiary prevention (preventing the retaking of substances after achieving abstinence), research evaluating programs for the treatment of abuse of alcohol and other drugs indicates a limited staying power. Recent insights in the psycho-and neurobiologies of addictive behavior and in the psychopharmacological properties of alcohol and other drugs provide clinicians with new pharmacological tools to prevent relapse.

TI Belief, Behavior, and Belonging: How Faith is Indispensable in
   Preventing and Recovering from Substance Abuse
SO JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
AB This study reviews the voluminous empirical evidence on faith's contribution to preventing people from falling victim to substance abuse and helping them recover from it. We find that 73% of addiction treatment programs in the USA include a spirituality-based element, as embodied in the 12-step programs and fellowships initially popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous, the vast majority of which emphasize reliance on God or a Higher Power to stay sober. We introduce and flesh out a typology of faith-based substance abuse treatment facilities, recovery programs, and support groups. This typology provides important background as we then move on to make an economic valuation of nearly 130,000 congregation-based substance abuse recovery support programs in the USA. We find that these faith-based volunteer support groups contribute up to $316.6 billion in savings to the US economy every year at no cost to tax payers. While negative experiences with religion (e.g., clergy sex abuse and other horrendous examples) have been a contributory factor to substance abuse among some victims, given that more than 84% of scientific studies show that faith is a positive factor in addiction prevention or recovery and a risk in less than 2% of the studies reviewed, we conclude that the value of faith-oriented approaches to substance abuse prevention and recovery is indisputable. And, by extension, we also conclude that the decline in religious affiliation in the USA is not only a concern for religious organizations but constitutes a national health concern.

AB In this article I investigate the characteristics and determinants of out-migration in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, using data from a panel designed to Investigate the household impact of the epidemic. Departure models show that individual attributes, notably age and gender, play an important role in explaining out-migration from households that have not experienced morbidity or mortality. In affected households, a number of household-level variables, notably the sex of the household head, place of residence, family structure, the dependency ratio, human capital and household size feature as important determinants of out-migration. Health shocks independently explain part of observed differences in out-migration from affected households, the out-migration of ill persons from affected households and the out-migration of orphaned children from affected households. Thus, migration represents an important strategy for poorer households having to cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, both as an economic survival strategy and as a social strategy aimed at accessing support from the extended family.

TI Modelling the HIV epidemic: A state-space approach
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB A state-space approach is proposed for modelling the HIV epidemic. This model allows us to estimate and project the number of AIDS cases and the number of infective people at different stages using the Kalman recursion, in which we combine the information from the dynamic model and the observation of AIDS cases. The dynamic models (the state equations) are derived from the chain multinomial model proposed by Tan and his colleagues. The observation equations are the observed (reported) AIDS cases and the total system population which can be obtained by population survey. The methodology is illustrated by modelling the HIV epidemic in the homosexual population in the city of San Francisco. A brief discussion is given on the relationship between the backcalculation and our approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Growing up with parental alcohol abuse: exposure to childhood abuse,
   neglect, and household dysfunction
SO CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB Objective: This study is a detailed examination of the association between parental alcohol abuse (mother only, father only, or both parents) and multiple forms of childhood abuse, neglect, and other household dysfunction, known as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Method: A questionnaire about ACEs including child abuse, neglect, household dysfunction, and exposure to parental alcohol abuse was completed by 8629 adult HMO members to retrospectively assess the relationship of growing up with parental alcohol abuse to 10 ACEs and multiple ACEs (ACE score). Results: Compared to persons who grew up with no parental alcohol abuse, the adjusted odds ratio for each category of ACE was approximately 2 to 13 times higher if either the mother, father, or both parents abused alcohol (p < 0.05). For example, the likelihood of having a battered mother was increased 13-fold for men who grew up with both parents who abused alcohol (OR, 12.7; 95% CI: 8.4-19.1). For almost every ACE, those who grew up with both an alcohol-abusing mother and father had the highest likelihood of ACEs. The mean number of ACEs for persons with no parental alcohol abuse, father only, mother only, or both parents was 1.4, 2.6, 3.2, and 3.8, respectively (p < .001). Conclusion: Although the retrospective reporting of these experiences cannot establish a causal association with certainly, exposure to parental alcohol abuse is highly associated with experiencing adverse childhood experiences. Improved coordination of adult and pediatric health care along with related social and substance abuse services may lead to earlier recognition, treatment, and prevention of both adult alcohol abuse and adverse childhood experiences, reducing the negative sequelae of ACEs in adolescents and adults.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to determine if parental substance abuse places children at a higher risk regarding their own substance abuse, illegal activities, and psychological functioning. An intake assessment was conducted with 299 crack smokers currently undergoing treatment. It revealed that clients with a parental history of substance abuse were at over twice the risk for antisocial personality disorders, had been arrested significantly more times as an adult, were more likely to report illicit drug use in the past year, and had received prior treatment more often than clients without a parental history of substance abuse. Surprisingly, no relationship was observed between parental history of substance abuse and preadult behaviors including age-of-onset of drug use, childhood conduct disorders, age at first antisocial behavior, or number of arrests before age 18. Future prevention and treatment efforts with similar populations should recognize the strong influence of the family in the development of substance abuse.

AB Based on the deeply analysis of the current status and the existing problems of GIS technology applications in Epidemiology, this paper has proposed the method and process for establishing the spatial decision support systems of AIDS epidemic prevention by integrating the COM GIS, Spatial Database, GPS, Remote Sensing, and Communication technologies, as well as ASP and ActiveX software development technologies. One of the most important issues for constructing the spatial decision support systems of AIDS epidemic prevention is how to integrate the AIDS spreading models with GIS. The capabilities of GIS applications in the AIDS epidemic prevention have been described here in this. paper firstly. Then some mature epidemic spreading models have also been discussed for extracting the computation parameters. Furthermore, a technical schema has been proposed for integrating the AIDS spreading models with GIS and relevant geospatial technologies, in which the GIS and model running platforms share a common spatial database and the computing results can be spatially visualized on Desktop or Web GIS clients. Finally, a complete solution for establishing the decision support systems of AIDS epidemic prevention has been offered in this paper based on the model integrating methods and ESRI COM GIS software packages. The general decision support systems are composed of data acquisition sub-systems, network communication sub-systems, model integrating sub-systems, AIDS epidemic information spatial database sub-systems, AIDS epidemic information querying and statistical analysis sub-systems, AIDS epidemic dynamic surveillance sub-systems, AIDS epidemic information spatial analysis and decision support sub-systems, as well as AIDS epidemic information publishing sub-systems based on Web GIS.

AB We describe characteristics of women alcohol abusers, risk factors for alcoholism in women, barriers to treatment, and implications and strategies for physicians dealing with alcohol abuse in women patients, including risk assessments and intervention strategies. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism have a different physiologic effect on women than on men. Societal attitudes about women and alcohol and internal (self-perception) and external (environmental) factors can create barriers to the detection and treatment of female alcohol abusers. Physicians are in an excellent position to address the medical, psychologic, and social concomitants of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. The Council on Scientific Affairs recommends that physicians become more active in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of alcohol-related problems in women, including the diseases that may be associated with chronic alcohol abuse and the effect of alcohol on the developing fetus. Specific American Medical Association policy and recommendations for physician practice are included.

AB Applying a public health perspective to drug abuse research has far-reaching implications. First, the health of the entire community is of concern, not just the individual patient. Because of the social impact of drug abuse, these problems become the responsibility of all citizens to address. Second, the perspective requires treating drug abuse as a health issue, not as a criminal justice, moral, or social issue. Third, as in other branches of medicine, applying this perspective to drug abuse research will encourage development of the most effective ways to enhance drug abuse prevention and treatment interventions through cross-disciplinary approaches. The public health approach requires studies that (1) determine need for intervention; (2) provide clues about etiology; (3) determine effective approaches, systems, and financing strategies; and (4) measure the impact of interventions and services on the health of a population. Overall, attending to the public health implications of research will help to assure the maximum impact of scientific findings.

TI Changes in clients' well-being (ORS) and state hope (SHS) during
   inpatient substance abuse treatment
SO NORDIC STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
AB Aims:
   During inpatient substance abuse treatment, professionals seek to help clients to achieve improvement in various life domains affected by substance abuse. Progress monitoring during substance abuse treatment has been called for, and in this study we examine how clients' levels of well-being and hope change during inpatient substance abuse treatment.
   Methods:
   Clients (N = 168) entered the treatment facility between January 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. The prospective data were gathered from one treatment unit located in central Finland on entry into treatment, during and at the end of treatment. Using the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) as a therapeutic tool was standard procedure in the treatment unit. Demographic information on participants, information on their previous substance use and scores on the State Hope Scale (SHS) were collected through structured questionnaires. Non-parametrical tests (Mann-Whitney U test; Kruskal-Wallis chi(2); Spearman's rho) were used to study changes in indicators of well-being and hope.
   Results:
   As hypothesised, inpatient treatment had a positive effect on both ORS and SHS and they were interrelated. Differences in gender, living situation and previous admissions were found when studying how the background information of the participants was related to the change achieved in ORS and SHS.
   Conclusions:
   Inpatient substance abuse treatment seemed to enhance both well-being and hope of the clients of inpatient substance abuse treatment.

   TERTIARY PREVENTION OF ALCOHOL-ABUSE
SO SEMAINE DES HOPITAUX
AB Secondary prevention of alcohol abuse rests on early diagnosis and treatment. To achieve this, a network of Healthy Nutrition Clinics (HNCs) using recent clinical and biochemical evaluation tools was created in France in 1975. However, these clinics have failed to focus on alcohol abuse as initially planned. Reasons for this failure are analyzed, as well as the postive and negative effects of the new directives issued in March 1983. Quantitative data show that secondary prevention of alcohol abuse has virtually disappeared from the activities of HNCs, raising a serious public health problem. With regard to tertiary prevention, public education programs focusing on the right of individuals to abstain from alcohol are needed. Efforts should be made to help abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals resume work and social activities.

TI Impact of drug abuse on academic performance and physical health: a
   cross-sectional comparative study among university students in
   Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG
AB Introduction Drug abuse, the driver of human self-destruction, is rapidly increasing among university students and is emerging as a global health concern. Students who abuse drugs are lagging in respect of academic performance, achievement, and other co-curricular activities. This study aims to investigate the differences in academic performance between drug abusers and non-abusers, and the factors associated with drug abuse among university students in Bangladesh. Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey among the students of five public and semi-public universities in Bangladesh. The sample size was drawn by using the snowball sampling technique. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data, and the data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Results Of the 436 participants, 54.59% (n = 238) were drug abusers. Male students (68.43%) were found to be significantly (p < 0.01) more into drug abuse. Sociodemographic factors including residence status, academic year in university, father's occupation, and personal income were significantly associated with drug abuse. There was a negative correlation between drug abuse and academic performance, academic achievement, and maintaining good health. Conclusion The findings of this study reported a high prevalence and magnitude of psychoactive drug abuse among the university students in Bangladesh, and stress the negative impact of drugs on the abuser's academic life and physical well-being. Therefore, adequate campus-based initiatives should be extended for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse.

TI Health care utilization of carpenters with substance abuse-related
   diagnoses
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
AB Background Persons in the construction trades in the US have high rates of alcohol and substance abuse. We had the unique opportunity to evaluate health care utilization through private insurance and workers' compensation for a group of carpenters at high risk of injury and substance abuse.
   Methods We identified a cohort of union carpenters. Their claims for medical care through union insurance and workers' compensation, and appropriate measures of time at risk were documented. Using methods of indirect standardization, we compared utilization and costs between carpenters with and without alcohol and substance-abuse related diagnoses (ASRD).
   Results Through private insurance, those with ASRD had 10% higher outpatient utilization and 2.1 times higher rates of hospitalizations for injury care; 2.6 times higher rates of outpatient care; and 2.9 times higher inpatient admissions for non-injury care. Individuals with ASRD had only modestly increased rates (10%) of outpatient utilization through workers' compensation.
   Conclusions These findings support the need for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment services for this workforce. Operationalizing this among highly mobile workforces, such as the construction trades, is a challenge. While not intending to minimize the problems of alcohol or substance abuse on the job among carpenters, the focus of prevention should not necessarily be in the workplace. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI Estimation and Projection of the HIV Epidemic Trend among the Migrant
   Population in China
SO BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Objective The migrant population is a vulnerable group for HIV infection in China. Understanding potential epidemic trends among migrants is critical for developing HIV preventative measures in this population.
   Methods The Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) model was used to process prefecture and county-level surveillance data to generate HIV prevalence and epidemic trends for migrant populations in China.
   Results The prevalence of HIV among migrants in 2009 was estimated at 0.075% (95% Cl: 0.042%, 0.108%) in China. The HIV epidemic among migrants is likely to increase over the next 5 years, with the prevalence expected to reach 0.110% (95% Cl: 0.070%, 0.150%) by 2015.
   Conclusion Although the 2009 estimates for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China indicate a slower rate of increase compared with the national HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is estimated to persistently increase among migrants over the next 5 years. Migrants will have a strong impact on the overall future of the HIV epidemic trend in China and evidence-based prevention and monitoring efforts should be expanded for this vulnerable population.

TI Professional development: Students' perceptions of an immersion elective
   in substance abuse
SO CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING
AB Objectives: Persons facing substance abuse and addiction are ubiquitous in all areas of pharmacy practice. Some colleges of pharmacy (COP) do not report didactic coursework in substance abuse. An off-site elective was developed to offer students an experience in immersion learning on this topic. The elective objectives were (1) to facilitate professional pharmacy student development by challenging student perceptions of people regarding addiction and substance abuse concerns and (2) to elicit input on the course structure and activities to improve entry-level pharmacist preparation. Participation in the second goal was optional.
   Methods: Eleven pharmacy students participated. Surveys and on-site student reports were evaluated for common themes of student learning and substance abuse knowledge. This project maintained participant anonymity and was approved by the University's institutional review board.
   Results: The most common self-reported experience was recognizing addiction as a disease. Secondly, students reported increased knowledge in the following areas: healthcare provider risk, disease prevention, and treatment options for impaired healthcare professionals. Students included personal reflections on the entire experience, assigned personal goals for service delivery, considered this education essential for adequate pharmacist preparation, self-reported changes in knowledge and understanding of substance abuse and addiction following completion of the elective, reported the experience would influence their practice as pharmacists, and opined more students should have access to this educational experience.
   Conclusion.' Pilot study data supported substance abuse education inclusion in core curricula. COPs are encouraged to use published curriculum guidelines as a road map for development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Traveling waves of a delayed HIV/AIDS epidemic model with treatment and
   spatial diffusion
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, a delayed HIV/AIDS epidemic model with treatment and spatial diffusion is introduced. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of a disease-free steady state and an endemic steady state is discussed. By using the cross-iteration method and Schauder's fixed point theorem, we reduce the existence of traveling waves to the existence of a pair of upper-lower solutions. By constructing a pair of upper-lower solutions, we derive the existence of a traveling wave solution connecting the disease-free steady state and the endemic steady state. It is shown that the existence of traveling waves of the proposed HIV/AIDS epidemic model is fully determined by the basic reproduction number and the minimal wave speed. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

TI Pancreatic adaptive responses in alcohol abuse: Role of the unfolded
   protein response
SO PANCREATOLOGY
AB The majority of those who drink excessive amounts of alcohol do not develop pancreatic disease. One over arching hypothesis is that alcohol abuse requires additional risk factors, either environmental or genetic, for disease to occur. However, another reason be a result of alcohol-induced activation of adaptive systems that protect the pancreas from the toxic effects of alcohol. We show that mechanisms within the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) that can lead to protection of the pancreas from pancreatic diseases with alcohol abuse. The remarkable ability of the pancreas to adapt its machinery to alcohol abuse using UPR systems and continue functioning is the likely reason that pancreatitis from alcohol abuse does not occur in the majority of heavy drinkers. These findings indicate that methods to enhance the protective responses of the UPR can provide opportunities for prevention and treatment of pancreatic diseases. Copyright (C) 2015, IAP and EPC.

TI Stability analysis of a fractional order model for the HIV/AIDS epidemic
   in a patchy environment
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB A multi-patch HIV/AIDS epidemic model with fractional order derivative is formulated to investigate the effect of human movement on the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic among patches. We derive the basic reproduction number R-0 and prove that if R-0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is locally and globally asymptotically stable. In the case of R-0 > 1, we obtain sufficient conditions under which the endemic equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable. We also formulate a fractional optimal control problem (FOCP), in which the state and co-state equations are given in terms of the left fractional derivatives. We incorporate into the model time dependent controls aimed at controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic. The necessary conditions for fractional optimal control of the disease are obtained. The simulation of the model is done with two patches. The numerical results show that implementing all the control efforts decreases significantly the number of HIV-infected and AIDS people in both patches. In addition, the value of Rc, the control reproduction number, for a long time is at its minimum level, and the value of objective functional J(u) increases when the fractional derivative order a is reduced from 1 (0.8 <= alpha <= 1).

AB Aim. In this study, burnout and its internal and external factors were investigated among substance abuse counsellors (no. = 68) who worked in Centres for Prevention and Substance Abuse Treatment (no. = 18) in Croatia. Methods. Maslach Burnout Inventory was used which measured three burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment; and questionnaire of internal and external burnout factors. Results. The higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and the higher level of personal accomplishment were determined. Factors such as work conditions, emotions about us and work, work organization and certain personality traits showed significant relationship with three burnout dimensions. Conclusions. Overall, findings implicated a certain specificity of professional burnout in substance abuse counsellors, and the need for specific design of mental health care for them.

The conceptual and empirical foundations of the game (both a college prevention version and substance abuse treatment version) are discussed. Pilot studies with college students and residents at a substance abuse treatment facility for probationers indicate that Downward Spiral is engaging, informative, and thought provoking. Plans for examining the impact of this game as a preventive technique (for the college setting) and as an approach to increasing motivation for substance abuse treatment are described.

   Epidemic
SO CURRENT HIV RESEARCH
AB The stubbornly high incidence of new HIV infections belies the overwhelming evidence showing that sustained highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has the power to dramatically reduce the spread of HIV infection and forever change the face of this devastating epidemic. One of the main contributors to this public health paradox is the ongoing HIV epidemic among substance users who contribute significantly to HIV infection rates through injection drug use and high- risk sexual behaviours. Current evidence clearly shows that, in order to fill this gap, we need to integrate substance abuse treatment with HIV treatment programmes and provide substance abusers with universal access to HIV treatment through a focussed effort to seek, test, treat, and retain hard- to- reach high risk individuals. These aims will require structural changes in the health care system to overcome many of the obstacles that have inhibited the merging of substance abuse treatment with HIV programmes for far too long.

SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB Alcohol and drug use are considered to be risk factors for suicidal behaviors in adolescence, but the precise nature of the relationship between suicidality and substance abuse, and the implications of this relationship for prevention and treatment interventions remain elusive. There are several conceptual issues that need to be addressed when considering the substance abuse-suicidality relationship. What are the most appropriate ways of defining suicidal behaviors? What are the best ways of assessing suicidal behavior and characterizing its course over time? Should adolescents who are suicidal be considered to be a single homogeneous population? What are the possible ways in which the course of substance abuse and suicidality over time are related? What factors potentially affect the trajectories of both substance abuse and suicidality? Does the relationship between substance abuse and suicidality change over time? And, to what extent can our knowledge of factors precipitating and maintaining the joint outcomes of suicidal and substance abuse behaviors be incorporated into interventions that target both? Careful consideration and exploration of these issues hopefully should improve our understanding the substance abuse-suicidality interrelationship, and ultimately the development of more effective prevention efforts and treatments for youths with both problems.

TI Disparities in the Patterns and Determinants of HIV Risk Behaviors among
   Adolescents Entering Substance Abuse Treatment Programs
SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the government, the grantees or the individuals above.
   Background: Black youth-are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This study examined disparities in patterns and determinants of sexual risk: behaviors among black and white adolescents in substance abuse treatment programs.
   Methods: We used pooled clinical data collected from 4,565 sexually active 12-17-year-old black (29.7%) and white (70.3%) adolescents entering outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment programs nationally. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine racial differences in patterns of sexual risk behavior s and the associations of these behaviors with demographic, socioenvironmental and psychosocial risk factors, including substance use and abuse, symptoms of mental disorders and criminal behaviors.
   Results: Blacks were significantly more likely-than whites to have had sex with multiple partners, purchased or traded sex and used substances to,enhance their sexual experiences, even after adjusting for demographic, socioenvironmental and psychosocial risk factors; Substance use and abuse, internalizing symptom and drug-related crimes ere significantly associated with enaging in >= 2 sexual risk behaviors in both groups: Disparities in determinants of HIV risk were also found. For instance, male gender, single-parent custody and history of criminal justice involvemeht, were-associated with having had sex wiht multiple partners-among blacks but not among whites. Demographic, socioenvironmeintal and psychosocial risk factors accounted for up to 30% of the variance in sexual risk in both groups.
   Conclusions.. Black adolescents with substance use problems are at greater risk for HIV-infection than their white peers because of their higher rates of sexual risk behaviors. Differences in co-occurring psychosocial problems did not fully explain racial disparities in sexual risk behaviors. HIV prevention progams for black adolescents in treatment should consider both individual and broader contextual factors that co-occur with sexual risk behaviors.

AB Alcohol and drug abuse is a serious global public health and medical problem affecting every demographic group. It is also highly stigmatizing, especially among Muslim populations, which limits self-report and research. This brief review will broadly summarize global alcohol and drug abuse research on the magnitude of the problem. It will then examine recent research published in English on alcohol and drug use and abuse among Muslim populations. The studies included are those limited to research on prevalence, risk factors, treatment, and prevention. Finally, the paper will conclude with recommendations for future research on alcohol and drug use and abuse among Muslim populations.

TI The spatial distribution pattern of human immunodeficiency
   virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome in China
SO GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) exhibit variable patterns among the provinces of China. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is needed for the prevention and control of AIDS. Thus, the cumulative number of reported cases of HIV/AIDS from the period 1985-2013, and the incidence rate of AIDS in 2013 were determined. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and hotspot analysis were conducted using ArcGIS10.2 to explore the spatial distribution of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Both the thematic map and the global spatial auto correlation Moran's / statistics revealed a clustered distribution of the spatial pattern. A local spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated hotspots of AIDS incidence rate that were confined to the provinces of Guangxi, Yunnan and Sichuan. The hotspots encompassed Guangxi and Yunnan, while Henan Province displayed a negative autocorrelation with more variable numbers that included neighbouring regions. The Getts-Ord G(i)* statistics identified 6 hotspots and 8 coldspots for the incidence of AIDS, and 7 hotspots and 1 coldspot for the cumulative number of reported cases of HIV/AIDS. The spatial distribution pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China is clustered, demonstrating hotspots located in the Southwest. Specific interventions targeting provinces with severe HIV/AIDS epidemic are urgently needed.

TI Substance Abuse Treatment as HIV Prevention: More Questions Than Answers
SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB This report examines associations between the availability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related health services in substance abuse treatment programs and characteristics of the programs and the patients they serve.
   In a cross-sectional, descriptive design and via a validated survey, program administrators within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network provided information on program characteristics, patient characteristics (rates of risky sexual and drug behaviors and HIV infection), and the availability of 31 different HIV-related health services.
   Of 319 programs, 84% submitted surveys. Service availability rates ranged from: 10% (pneumococcal vaccination) to 86% (drug testing) for the 6 HIV-related services offered to all patients, 13% (Pc p smear for women) to 54% (tuberculin skin testing) forth? 6 services offered to new patients, 2% (sterile injection equipment) to 64% (male condoms) for the 4 risk-reduction services, 37% (Pap smear for women) to 61% (tuberculin skin testing) for the 11 biological assessments offered to HIV-positive patients, and 33% (medical treatments) to 52% (counseling) for the 4 other services offered to HIV-positive patients. The availability of these HIV-related services was associated with clinical settings, the types of addiction treatment services, the rates of risky drug and sexual behaviors, and HIV infection rates among patients. Availability of such services was below published guidelines.
   While the results provide another basis for the infection-related prevention benefits of substance abuse treatment, the variability in the availability of HIV-related health care deserves further study and has health policy implications in determining how to utilize substance abuse treatment in reducing drug-related HIV transmission.

SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Brazil and South Africa were among the first countries profoundly impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and had similar rates of HIV infection in the early 1990s. Today, Brazil has less than 1% adult HIV prevalence, implemented treatment and prevention programmes early in the epidemic, and now has exemplary HIV/AIDS programmes. South Africa, by contrast, has HIV prevalence of 18% and was, until recently, infamous for its delayed and inappropriate response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This article explores how differing relationships between AIDS movements and governments have impacted the evolving policy responses to the AIDS epidemic in both countries, including through AIDS programme finance, leadership and industrial policy related to production of generic medicines.

TI Free terminal time optimal control of a fractional-order model for the

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we present a fractional model for the HIV/AIDS epidemic and incorporate into the model control parameters of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), behavioral change and antiretroviral therapy (ART) aimed at. controlling the spread of diseases. We prove the local and global asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model. We present a general fractional optimal control problem (FOCP) with free terminal time and develop the Adapted Forward-Backward Sweep method for numerical solving of the FOCP. Necessary conditions for a state/control/terminal time triplet to be optimal are obtained. The results show that the use of all controls increases the life expectancy of HIV-treated patients with ART and remarkably increases the number of people undergoing PrEP and changing their sexual habits. Also, when the derivative order alpha (0.45 <= alpha <= 1) limits to 1, the value of optimal terminal time increases while the value of objective functional decreases.

TI Commentary on why national epidemiological estimates of substance abuse
   by race should not be used to estimate prevalence and need for substance
   abuse services at community and local levels
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
AB Large-scale epidemiological studies suggest substantially lower prevalence rates of substance abuse disorders in Black Americans than in White Americans. This is counterintuitive since indicators of socioeconomic status, which on an average are lower in Blacks than Whites, are inversely associated with the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Herein, we recommend against the use of race-specific national epidemiological data to estimate prevalence of substance abuse disorders and need for services at community/local levels. This is important so that catchment areas with high proportions of minorities receive equitable levels of substance abuse prevention and treatment resources. We illustrate our recommendation through observations and potential biases (e.g., reporting bias) identified from large-scale epidemiological studies of the prevalence of substance use disorders between Black and White Americans.

TI Substance abuse, comorbidity, and sensation seeking: Gender differences
SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
AB Two hundred sixty-two probands and 261 of their relatives with DSM-III-R diagnoses of drug and alcohol abuse and/or anxiety disorders completed the Zuckerman Sensation Seeking Scale. It was hypothesised that subjects with both substance abuse disorders and comorbid anxiety disorders would have lower sensation-seeking profiles than subjects with substance abuse alone. This was confirmed in women, with thrill- and adventure-seeking scores showing significant differences between pure substance abusers and those with a comorbid anxiety disorder, lending support to theories that substance abusers are a heterogeneous group. In men, there were fewer significant differences between diagnostic groups. If substance abusers are indeed a heterogeneous group, with some motivated by high sensation-seeking needs, a better understanding of these motivations can lead to more effective strategies of prevention and treatment, according to etiology.

SO ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AB Associations among mother-daughter attachment, mother and daughter substance abuse, and daughter's sexual behavior under the influence of drugs and alcohol were investigated among 158 adult U.S. Latina daughters. Latina daughters were sampled from four mother-daughter dyad types: substance abusing mother and daughter, substance abusing mother only, substance abusing daughter only, and non-substance-abusing mother and daughter. Substance abusing daughters with substance abusing mothers, and daughters who were less strongly attached to their mothers, reported more sex under the influence of drugs. Age, marital status, substance abuse, and mother's substance abuse all influenced the daughter's sex under the influence of alcohol. An unexpected positive association between attachment and sex under the influence of alcohol was found for daughters who were more closely attached to a substance abusing mother. Implications for future research, and HIV/AIDS and drug prevention and treatment programs for Latinas are discussed.

TI Prior substance abuse and related treatment history reported by recent
   victims of sexual assault
SO ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
AB To inform intervention approaches, the current study examined prevalence and comorbidity of recent use and history of abuse of alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs as well as history of substance treatment among a sample of female victims of sexual assault seeking post-assault medical care. Demographic variables and prior history of assault were also examined to further identify factors relevant to treatment or prevention approaches. Participants were 255 women and adolescent girls seeking post sexual assault medical services who completed an initial follow-up assessment on average within 3 months post-assault. The majority (72.9%) reported recent substance use prior to assault, approximately 40% reported prior substance abuse history, and 12.2% reported prior substance treatment history. Prior history of assault was associated with recent drug use and history of drug abuse as well as substance treatment. Among those with prior histories of substance abuse and assault, assault preceded substance abuse onset in the majority of cases. Almost all those with prior treatment history reported recent drug or alcohol use. A portion of sexual assault survivors seen for acute medical services may benefit from facilitated referral for substance abuse treatment in addition to counseling at the time of screening. Assessment and intervention approaches should target alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drug use and abuse. Substance use and associated impairment may serve as a rape tactic by perpetrators of assault. Substance use at the time of assault does not imply blame on the part of assault victims. Previous findings indicate that rape poses high risk of PTSD particularly among women with prior history of assault. Screening and intervention related to substance abuse should be done with recognition of the increased vulnerability it may pose with regard to assault and the high risk of PTSD within this population.

TI Can Major Public Health Emergencies Affect Changes in International Oil
   Prices?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB In order to deepen the understanding of the impact of major public health emergencies on the oil market and to enhance the risk response capability, this study analyzed the logical relationship between major public health emergencies and international oil price changes, identified the change points, and calculated the probability of abrupt changes to international oil prices. Based on monthly data during six major public health emergencies from 2009 to 2020, this study built a product partition model. The results show that only the influenza A (H1N1) and COVID-19 pandemics were significant reasons for abrupt changes in international oil prices. Furthermore, the wild poliovirus epidemic, the Ebola epidemic, the Zika epidemic, and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had limited effects. Overall, the outbreak of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in major global economies has a more pronounced impact on international oil prices.

TI Neighborhood alcohol outlet density and rates of child abuse and
   neglect: Moderating effects of access to substance abuse services
SO CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB This study investigates the relationship between concentrations of on- and off-premises alcohol outlets and rates of child abuse and neglect. Additionally, the study seeks to locate protective features of a neighborhood's built environment by investigating the potentially moderating role that access to substance abuse treatment and prevention services plays in the relationship between alcohol outlet density and child maltreatment. Using a cross-sectional design, this ecological study utilized data from 163 census tracts in Bergen County, New Jersey, on reports of child abuse and neglect, alcohol outlets, substance abuse treatment and prevention facilities, and the United States Census to investigate the linkages between socioeconomic structure, alcohol availability, and access to substance abuse service facilities on rates of child abuse and neglect. Findings indicate areas with a greater concentration of on-premises alcohol outlets (i.e., bars) had higher rates of child neglect, and those with easier access to substance abuse services had lower rates of neglect, controlling for neighborhood demographic and socioeconomic structure. Additionally, the relationship between on-premises alcohol outlet density and rates of child neglect was moderated by the presence of substance abuse service facilities. A greater concentration of off-premises outlets (i.e., liquor stores) was associated with lower rates of physical abuse. Findings suggest that the built environment and socioeconomic structure of neighborhoods have important consequences for child well-being. The implications for future research on the structural features of neighborhoods that are associated with child well-being are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Substance abuse remains a staggering conundrum for millions of youth worldwide. Use of tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs of abuse (Box 1) exacts a horrific toll on society and on the health of youth throughout the world [1-16]. This discussion presents selected comments on the epidemiology, etiology, evaluation, general treatment, and prevention of drug abuse among adolescents. In addition, comments on selected drugs of abuse are provided. It is recommended that all primary care clinicians be actively involved in the education, prevention, and management of adolescent drug use and abuse [17-27]. Community-based drug abuse prevention programs are encouraged for adolescents in school, out of school, at work, and in other situations [27-29].

TI Monitoring and Evaluation of Substance Abuse Services in South Africa:
   Implications for Policy and Practice
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
AB Although outcomes monitoring and the collection of other performance data holds benefits for service managers and policy makers, the extent to which these data are collected by South African substance abuse service providers is unknown. To describe (i) the extent to which substance abuse service providers in South Africa monitor and evaluate their programmes and (ii) the availability of structures to support monitoring and evaluation activities within these services. Cross-sectional surveys of substance abuse treatment services were conducted in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces (2006-2007) and the Central and Northern region of the country (2007-2008). A survey of prevention services was conducted in the Cape Town metropole (2008). Across all sites approximately half of the services reported never having evaluated their programmes. In addition, less than two thirds of treatment facilities routinely monitor client outcomes. Even where monitoring and evaluation did occur, less than a third of facilities used standardised questionnaires and less than two-thirds used urinalyses to collect outcomes data. Based on the above findings, a number of recommendations are made to expand monitoring and evaluation within South African substance abuse services.

AB Independent documentary filmmaking in contemporary China offers an alternative vision to official, mainstream, and commercial productions. This essay shows how the practices of independent filmmakers constitute alternative perspectives by first exploring representations of the AIDS epidemic and AIDS orphans in China, and then by examining reconstructions of sociopolitical history silenced by official discourse and ignored in collective memory. Also discussed are gender politics in documentaries which use women as discursive or visual subjects and the question of why the perspective of gender remains marginal to the documentary film practices.

TI The HIV/AIDS epidemic revisited in times of COVID-19: advocating for
   responsibility and rights in South African writing
SO SAFUNDI-THE JOURNAL OF SOUTH AFRICAN AND AMERICAN STUDIES
AB This paper examines two autobiographical responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa from the perspective of responsibility and rights. The analysis draws on interdisciplinary studies of the epidemic and its effects on South African communities. Memoirs by Edwin Cameron and Sister Abegail Ntleko address challenges in South Africa with regard to attitudes toward and treatment of HIV-infected people. Both writers use their texts to advocate for social and political responsibility and for the rights of those infected. Rian Malan's essays function as a counterpoint, bringing into focus controversial questions about the role of funding and reliable statistics for the epidemic. The topic is relevant in a South African context where antiretroviral treatment was met with skepticism in official political discourse. Representations of responsibilities and rights as well as official responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic have been additionally reexamined in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving the epidemic renewed relevance.

TI Mental disorders and harmful substance use in children of substance
   abusing parents: A longitudinal register-based study on a complete birth
   cohort born in 1991
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
AB Introduction and Aims. Adverse childhood experiences and their accumulation over childhood have negative outcomes to children, yet earlier findings on the independent effect of parental substance abuse seem inconsistent. Our aims were to examine: (i) whether parental substance abuse is associated with children's mental disorders in mid-childhood (7-12 years) and mental disorders and own substance use in adolescence (13-17years); and (ii) whether children are affected differently by a mother or father's substance abuse. Design and Methods. A register-based longitudinal data on a complete birth cohort of children born in Finland in 1991 (n=65 117) and their biological parents. The children were followed until their 18th birthday. Data were derived from the Finnish administrative registries. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used in the analysis. Results. Maternal, paternal and both parents' substance abuse were significant predictors of mental disorders and harmful substance use in children aged 13-17 years, even after controlling for other adverse childhood experiences, parental education and child's gender. Parental substance abuse predicted mental disorders in children aged 7-12 years in bivariate model but in multivariate model the association disappeared. Maternal substance abuse had stronger effect on harmful substance use in adolescent children than paternal. There were no significant interactions between substance abusing parents' gender and the child's gender. Discussion and Conclusions. Early identification, prevention and treatment of substance abuse in families with children in primary health care, child welfare and other services are crucial in preventing intergenerational transmission of the problems associated with parental substance abuse.

TI How does stress increase risk of drug abuse and relapse?
SO PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Rationale: The notion that stress leads to drug abuse in vulnerable individuals and relapse in addicts is not new. Most major theories of addiction postulate that stress plays an important role in increasing drug use and relapse. Several animal studies and some human laboratory studies have shown that stress exposure enhances drug self-administration. Although clinical observations suggest that exposure to stress increases drug use, and are associated with craving and relapse in addicts, human research in this area is largely correlational and at times contradictory. Objective: Given the growing preclinical evidence that supports the key role of stress in substance abuse, careful examination of this research area in humans is warranted. This paper examines empirical evidence on how stress may increase the vulnerability to drug abuse, and explores whether chronic drug abuse alters the stress response and coping in addicts, thereby increasing the likelihood of drug seeking and relapse. Unanswered questions on the association between stress and substance abuse in humans are identified. Conclusion: Preclinical research has shown that stress, in addition to drug itself, plays a key role in perpetuating drug abuse and relapse. However, the mechanisms underlying this association in humans remain unclear. A greater understanding of how stress may perpetuate drug abuse will likely have a significant impact on both prevention and treatment development in the field of addiction.

This document proposes a financing and delivery system to unlock broad access to PrEP for those most vulnerable to HIV acquisition and bring an end to the HIV epidemic.

TI A STOCHASTIC-MODEL OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC AND THE HIV-INFECTION
   DISTRIBUTION IN A HOMOSEXUAL POPULATION
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
AB In this paper we develop a stochastic model for the HIV epidemic in a homosexual population and use the model to characterize the HIV infection distribution and seroconversion distribution. Through computer-generated infection distributions and seroconversion distributions, we assess the effects of various risk factors on these distributions. The fitting of some data sets generated by computer suggests that the three-parameter generalized log-logistic distribution should be assumed as the infection distribution for the proposed stochastic model of HIV epidemics.

TI The Ebola epidemic in West Africa: Challenges, opportunities, and policy
   priority areas
SO NURSING OUTLOOK
AB The ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa has drawn attention to global health inequalities, in particular the inadequacies of health care systems in sub-Saharan African countries for appropriately managing and containing infectious diseases. The purpose of this article is to examine the sociopolitical and economic conditions that created the environment for the Ebola epidemic to occur, identify challenges to and opportunities for the prevention and control of Ebola and future outbreaks, and discuss policy recommendations and priority areas for addressing the Ebola epidemic and future outbreaks in West Africa. Articles in peer-reviewed journals on health system reforms in developing countries and periodicals of international organizations were used to gather the overview reported in this article. We identify individual, structural, and community challenges that must be addressed in an effort to reduce the spread of Ebola in West Africa. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa underscores the need for the overhaul and transformation of African health care systems to build the capacity in these countries to address infectious diseases. Public-private partnerships for investment in developing countries' health care systems that involve the international community are critical in addressing the current Ebola epidemic and future outbreaks.

TI Adolescent Health-Risk Sexual Behaviors: Effects of a Drug Abuse
   Intervention
SO AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB Adolescents who abuse substances are more likely to engage in health-risking sexual behavior (HRSB) and are at particularly high risk for HIV/AIDS. Thus, substance abuse treatment presents a prime opportunity to target HIV-risk behaviors. The present study evaluated a one-session HIV-risk intervention embedded in a controlled clinical trial for drug-abusing adolescents. The trial was conducted in New Mexico and Oregon with Hispanic and Anglo adolescents. Youths were randomly assigned to individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or to an integrated behavioral and family therapy (IBFT) condition, involving individual and family sessions. The HIV-specific intervention was not associated with change. IBFT and CBT were both efficacious in reducing HIV-risk behaviors from intake to the 18-month follow-up for high-risk adolescents. For low-risk adolescents, CBT (versus IBFT) was more efficacious in suppressing HRSB. These data suggest that drug abuse treatments can have both preventative and intervention effects for adolescents, depending on their relative HIV-risk.

AB The drug problem in China reappeared in the late 1980s. At that time, most drug abusers used opium only, with heroin accounting for a very small proportion and its use being limited to border areas in the southwest and rural areas in the northwest. Beginning in the early 1990s, drug abuse spread quickly. The number of registered drug addicts increased from 70,000 in 1990 to one million by the end of 2002. Besides opioids, some "new" kinds of drugs including amphetamines and ketamine have penetrated the country through various channels since 1997. Drug abuse has caused severe problems for both the abusers and society. Three types of treatment settings for detoxification and rehabilitation are available: compulsory detoxification institutions, rehabilitation units through labor, and voluntary detoxification institutions run by sections of public security, justice, and health, respectively. Medical treatment is often combined with psychological counseling and physical training. Pharmaceutical therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and nonpharmaceutical therapy are utilized for opioid addiction. Drug prevention, especially for young people, is emphasized. NGOs at different levels have all joined in this work. Intervention work was also started in regions where drug abuse and HIV/AIDS problems are serious. Drug abusers are helped to keep drug free after being released from detoxification settings by their communities. Different levels of institutions engaged in research on drug abuse are found in all parts of China.

AB To date, researchers investigating gender in relation to social issues underscore women and appear to sideline men. Focusing on women in studies concerning sociogender issues may exclude not only men from mainstream research, but also those who do not fit into the binary gender system, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) people. One area closely related to gender issues is the HIV epidemic. Mainstream discussions of men and other versions of masculinity and femininity including GLBT people in the gender-related studies of the HIV epidemic can decrease the vulnerability of individuals against HIV infections regardless of their biological sex.

AB Being, lately, one of the most important health issues, substance use and abuse has captured the attention of many researchers in the field. Nowadays, researchers mostly focus on how peoples'everyday environments and the political and cultural contexts in which they live in influence the prevalence and consequences of substance abuse.
   Geographers can contribute to this type of research on substance use and abuse by making connections between place environments and health and by using geographic tools in order to explore these associations. The geographic tools and methods have been centered around geographic information systems (GIS).
   The present paper approaches the discussion on how place concepts and geographic information systems tools have been used in understanding health and it suggests avenues of explorations for research on substance abuse. The concept of place provides a background for understanding the way in which substance abuse bahaviors, prevention and treatment relate to place environments from the personal scale to the global scale.

TI ALPHA-THETA BRAINWAVE NEUROFEEDBACK TRAINING - AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
   FOR MALE AND FEMALE ALCOHOLICS WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB This was an experimental study of 14 alcoholic outpatients using the Peniston and Kulkosky (1989, 1991) brainwave treatment protocol for alcohol abuse. After temperature biofeedback pretraining, experimental subjects completed 20 40-minute sessions of alpha-theta brainwave neurofeedback training (BWNT). Experimentally treated alcoholics with depressive syndrome showed sharp reductions in self-assessed depression (Beck's Depression Inventory). On the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-I, the experimental subjects showed significant decreases on the BR scores: schizoid, avoidant, dependent, histrionic, passive-aggression, schizotypal, borderline, anxiety, somatoform, hypomanic, dysthmic, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, psychotic thinking, and psychotic depression. Twenty-one-month follow-up data indicated sustained prevention of relapse in alcoholics who completed BWNT.

TI SUBSTANCE-ABUSE AND CONTROL IN THE UNITED-STATES - ETHICAL AND LEGAL
   ISSUES
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB In 1986, the United States began to wage its most recent War on Drugs. This has involved establishing various policies and making investments to implement these policies and approaches. In general, the U.S. has taken a tough-guy stand to drug abuse and control that emphasizes punishment, restriction, and 'social warfare', as opposed to a public health oriented position. Current policy reflects a 'quick fix' solution to a complex problem, which may partially explain its failure and why we appear to be losing the War on Drugs. In this review I summarize the current debates and controversies surrounding drug abuse in the U.S. regarding the extent of the drug problem, the need for drug control, prevention efforts, legalization controversy, workplace strategies, treatment dilemmas, and maternal drug abuse. I argue that a radically different approach must be taken that is grounded in public health methods and an appreciation of the larger social context in which drug abuse occurs. We must look for a long-term solution to this complex problem that is integrated into society, and which is certainly resistant to the current quick fix approaches.

TI Centering African-Descendant Women in HIV/AIDS Research, Policy, and

SO MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM
AB In recent decades, Brazil has been hailed as a model of successful prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. For nearly three decades, the country has been at the forefront of progressive and proactive approaches to slow the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While recognizing Brazil's tremendous successes with respect to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, this article offers a framework for understanding the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on African-descendant women in the country. The analysis focuses on the gender and racial dynamics of HIV/AIDS and seeks to center Afro-Brazilian women's experiences in relation to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It also examines black women's HIV/AIDS activism and argues for the importance of an intersectional approach to HIV/AIDS research and health policy in Brazil.

TI Journals of the plague years: Documenting the history of the AIDS
   epidemic in the United States
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB This commentary discusses several journalistic literary, and historical accounts of the AIDS epidemic as it has unfolded in the United States over the past 2 decades. By examining the different ways that different types of storytellers chronicle the political, social, public health, medical, and economic aspects of epidemic disease, this essay will demonstrate why the AIDS epidemic has been of such intense interest not only to physicians and public health experts but also to journalists, novelists, playwrights, memoirists, and historians. AIDS is a particularly fascinating example of society's broad concern with epidemics because it both is a global pandemic and, in recent years, has become a chronic disease.

SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB Substance abuse patterns were reviewed for a group of patients admitted to the Gambling Treatment Program at the Brecksville Veterans Administration Medical Center.
   A retrospective chart review of 113 consecutively admitted patients between September 2000 and September 2001 found that 66.4% of pathological gamblers had a lifetime history of substance abuse or dependence at some point in their lives. A history of substance abuse or dependence was less common among gamblers aged 60 and above.
   In the year prior to admission, 58.1% of those with a history of substance abuse or dependence were actively using substances. Alcohol was the most commonly used substance, followed by marijuana and cocaine. In most gamblers with comorbid disorders, the onset of substance dependence preceded the onset of problem gambling.
   Pathological gamblers engaged in multiple impulsive and dysfunctional behaviors including suicide attempts, compulsive shopping and spending, and compulsive sexual behavior, and the presence of comorbid substance abuse disorders may influence the degree to which pathological gamblers engage in these additional problematic behaviors. These factors have important implications for treatment and prevention of relapse, as well as for theories of addictions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Gender differences in social and psychological problems of substance
   abusers: A comparison to nonsubstance abusers
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
AB This study examines gender differences in 16 social and psychological problems among substance abusers and nonsubstance abusers in a community population to determine whether such differences are simply a reflection of differences between men and women in the general population. Data were gathered from 119 respondents using the Addiction Severity Index. Loglinear analysis suggests that problems typically attributed to ''being a female substance abuser'' may be due to the effect of gender or substance abuse alone. Only two problems significantly distinguish female substance abusers from the other comparison groups:psychiatric hospitalizations and relatives with substance abuse. However, women in the overall sample were more troubled by family problems, had more parents with psychiatric problems, and received more outpatient psychiatric treatment. Problems associated with substance abuse, not gender, include divorce, problems controlling violence, and parents with substance abuse problems. These findings suggest that substance-abusing women experience a ''double whammy'' because they incur both the problems of women and the problems of substance abusers. Disaggregating gender and substance abuse effects has implications for treatment-matching and relapse prevention, specifically for suggesting strategies that address the special vulnerabilities of substance-abusing women.

AB A novel HIV/AIDS epidemic model in which we incorporate a new compartment, that is, treatment compartment T, is introduced. The global dynamics of our model are determined by the basic reproduction number R-0. When the basic reproduction number R-0 is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. When the basic reproduction number R-0 is greater than unity, the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are conducted to support our analytic results.

TI Substance abuse treatment in human immunodeficiency virus: The role of
   patient-provider discussions
SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB Substance abuse treatment is associated with decreases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior and can improve HIV outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with substance abuse treatment utilization, including patient-provider discussions of substance use issues. We surveyed 951 HIV-infected adults receiving care at 14 HIV Research Network primary care sites regarding drug and alcohol use, substance abuse treatment, and provider discussions of substance use issues. Although 71% reported Substance use, only 24% reported receiving substance abuse treatment and less than half reported discussing substance use issues with their HIV providers. In adjusted logistic regression models, receipt of substance abuse treatment was associated with patient-provider discussions. Patient-provider discussions of substance use issues were associated with current drug use, hazardous or binge drinking, and Black race or ethnicity, though substance use was comparable between Blacks and Whites. These data suggest potential opportunities for improving engagement in substance abuse treatment services. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Theology and HIV/AIDS in Latin America - Perspectives and challenges
SO ESTUDOS TEOLOGICOS
AB This article presents data about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Latin America, revealing the challenge it poses and the kind of responses it requires from theology. It maps briefly the main forms of religious response to the epidemic, as well as some theological reflections produced in Latin America. It asks about the little attention given to it, especially in the context of Liberation Theology, in contrast with a more dense production by feminist and gay/queer theologies, pointing to an "indecent theology" as a theological discourse and practice able to respond to the issues presented by the epidemic. At last, proposes the "body", taken in its materiality, as a fundamental category for the theological production starting from the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Let's talk about sex: helping substance abuse counsellors address HIV
   prevention with men who have sex with men
SO CULTURE HEALTH & SEXUALITY
AB Integrating HIV prevention into substance abuse counselling is recommended to ameliorate the health outcomes of men who have sex with men. However, culture-based countertransferences (CBCs) may hamper this effort. Using a case illustration, this paper will explain the manifestation of CBCs held among substance abuse counsellors and how they hinder counsellors' work with men who have sex with men. The following CBCs will be explored: distancing, topic avoidance, heteronormativity, assumptions and denying client strengths. These CBCs allow counsellors to avoid discussions about sexual practices and curtail HIV prevention counselling, while undermining the counsellor-client relationship. Based on the empirical literature on HIV and substance abuse prevention with men who have sex with men, we provide recommendations to help counsellors overcome CBCs and integrate HIV prevention consistently with men who are in treatment for substance abuse.

TI Self-Perceived Strengths Among Adolescents With and Without Substance
   Abuse Problems
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB The importance of examining positive aspects of youth development has been emphasized across disciplines involved in the care of youth with substance abuse problems. However, little is known about the strengths of adolescents with substance abuse problems, especially youth entering residential treatment. Utilizing the Strengths Assessment Inventory, a measure assessing psychological and social strengths, we examined patterns of strengths across groups of age- and gender-matched youth who reported no substance use, frequent substance use, and those entering treatment for severe substance use. Each group consisted of 43 participants ranging in age from 14 to 18 years. Results indicated that, on average, individuals entering treatment scored lower on personal strengths. However, through the use of more sophisticated statistical approaches, it was found that certain strengths were predictive of individuals belonging to the treatment group. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to the treatment of adolescent substance abuse problems.

TI Ideology and social work practice in substance abuse settings
SO SOCIAL WORK
AB The profession of social work has a unique role in preventing and treating alcohol and other drug problems. In human services settings shared beliefs or ideologies of care are expected to have substantial influence over the way in which problems ave perceived and the types of service technologies used. Thus, it is important that social work professionals be cognizant of what beliefs they hold and how their beliefs about substance abuse treatment and prevention may affect practice. This article discusses current ideologies of care in the substance abuse arena, including the disease/abstinence, psychosocial, ecological, and harm-reduction approaches. In addition, this article examines managers' beliefs about substance abuse programs to determine if there are differences between those who have a social work background (that is, hold at least one social work degree) and those who do not. Suggestions for social work practice and future research also are provided.

TI Gender differences among adolescents with substance abuse problems at
   Maria clinics in Sweden
SO NORDIC STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
AB Aim: The article describes similarities and differences regarding various risk factors between girls and boys with substance abuse problems who begin outpatient treatment at the Maria clinics in Sweden. Potential hypotheses and some implications are also discussed. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on interview data from 2169 adolescents obtained over three years from outpatient clinics in 11 Swedish cities. Results: Girls appear to consistently have more difficult family and childhood environments than boys, and are more likely to have problems related to school, more serious substance abuse problems, and more severe mental health problems. Criminal activity is significantly higher among boys. Conclusions: The study shows that girls entering treatment generally have significantly more risk factors than boys and thus more extensive problems in several aspects of life, which in turn increases the risk of developing serious drug and alcohol problems in adulthood. The study supports the gender-paradoxical relationship in which a smaller proportion of girls than boys enter treatment for substance abuse, even though girls tend to have more problematic life situations.

SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB During the last few decades, community coalitions have increasingly emerged as program vehicles for coping with alcohol and other drug problems. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported "Fighting Back," a community coalition program between 1992 and 2002 that was developed at each community and operated at 15 sites in 11 states. The program's goal was the reduction of alcohol abuse and illegal drug use through coalitions. An outside interdisciplinary evaluation of the Fighting Back and matched comparison sites concluded that the program had no significant effect on substance abuse. Various aspects of the evaluation are discussed. For the last 15 years, the federal government has supported hundreds of anti-substance abuse coalitions. In the articles that follow, different features of the evaluation dealing with results, treatment of substance abusers, community structure, correlative factors, research methodology, bibliography, and a funder's perspective are set forth.

TI Biological basis of sex differences in drug abuse: preclinical and
   clinical studies
SO PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The recent focus on drug abuse in women has brought attention to numerous differences between women and men. In this review, we discuss both preclinical and clinical findings of sex differences in drug abuse as well as mechanisms that may underlie these differences. Recent evidence suggests that the progression to dependence and abuse may differ between women and men; thus, different prevention and treatment strategies may be required. Similar sex differences in drug sensitivity and self-administration have been reported in laboratory animal studies. Females appear to be more vulnerable than males to the reinforcing effects of psychostimulants, opiates, and nicotine during many phases of the addiction process (e.g. acquisition, maintenance, dysregulation-escalation, relapse). Male and female animals differ in their behavioral, neurological, and pharmacological responses to drugs. Although the role of sex in the mechanisms of drug action remains unclear, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen, play a role in producing sex differences in drug abuse. Future research is necessary to provide information on how to design more effective drug abuse treatment programs and resources that are sex specific.

TI Characteristics of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Women Aged 15-49 Years from

SO BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Objective To describe the characteristics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in women aged 15-49 years in China.
   Methods HIV/AIDS cases from 2005 to 2012 that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified on the Chinese HIV/AIDS case reporting system. Descriptive and spatial analyses were performed.
   Results A total of 103,559 female HIV/AIDS cases were included in our study. Based on the descriptive analysis, between 2005 and 2012, the proportion of heterosexually acquired HIV infection among women (15-49 years) increased rapidly from 35.8% to 87.4%. Approximately 60% of these cases were infected through non-marital heterosexual contact. Among older women (40-49 years), a slightly increasing trend was identified. The spatial analysis detected 'hot spots' in the Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Chongqing provinces. The epidemic trends in these areas were predominately driven by heterosexual transmission.
   Conclusion Non-marital heterosexual contact is a very important factor in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in women aged 15-49 years, and the HIV infection rate in older women is increasing. Several epidemic hot spots were detected in northwestern and southwestern China. Efficient interventions are needed to control the spread of HIV/AIDS among women living in these areas.

TI A review of technology-assisted self-help and minimal contact therapies
   for drug and alcohol abuse and smoking addiction: Is human contact
   necessary for therapeutic efficacy?
SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB Technology-based self-help and minimal contact therapies have been proposed as effective and low-cost interventions for addictive disorders, such as nicotine, alcohol, and drug abuse and addiction. The present article reviews the literature published before 2010 on computerized treatments for drug and alcohol abuse and dependence and smoking addiction. Treatment studies are examined by disorder as well as amount of therapist contact, ranging from self-administered therapy and predominantly self-help interventions to minimal contact therapy where the therapist is actively involved in treatment but to a lesser degree than traditional therapy and predominantly therapist-administered treatments involving regular contact with a therapist for a typical number of sessions. In the treatment of substance use and abuse it is concluded that self-administered and predominantly self-help computer-based cognitive and behavioral interventions are efficacious, but some therapist contact is important for greater and more sustained reductions in addictive behavior.

TI TREATMENT OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE-ABUSERS - ISSUES FOR PRACTICE AND
   RESEARCH
SO SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE
AB Treatment of adolescent substance abuse poses difficult challenges to social work practitioners. Effective intervention requires awareness of assessment and treatment approaches and knowledge of individual, peer, and family factors that contribute to alcohol or drug use. Social work's emphasis on contextual factors in the etiology and maintenance of addictive disorders is an important contribution to substance abuse treatment. Practitioners are in an excellent position to implement interventions addressing multiple causes of substance abuse. This paper discusses the prevalence of alcohol and drug use among adolescents in the United States. Assessment issues are identified and promising approaches to treating adolescents with substance use problems are noted. Implications for social work practice and research are delineated.

TI Rapid disease progression and the rate of spread of the HIV epidemic
SO AIDS
AB Traditional HIV epidemic models suggest that rapid disease progression may lead to reduced transmission because of a decreased time for the spread of the virus. We present a transmission model structured by age and duration of infection, and propose that rapid disease progression may lead to higher viraemia at a younger age, when individuals are more sexually active. We suggest that rapid disease progression should be considered as a factor in the scale of the HIV epidemic in Africa.

TI GROWTH-MODELS AND THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN FINLAND
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Today, we know a lot about HIV and AIDS, yet too little to be able to stop the pandemic by a vaccination or by medication. Until that day is at hand, the only means of controlling the pandemic is by information-information about the diffusion of the virus, about risk behaviour, about safe sex, and about social responsibility. Educating people must be based on concise clinical experience, an up-to-date picture of the epidemiological situation, and reliable forecasts about the future course of the epidemic. Producing reliable forecasts about the HIV epidemic has proved to be a more complicated task than expected. The proven, reliable, and in most cases very useful epidemiological models have been far from successful when applied to the HIV epidemic. The reason for this is mostly due to the lack of reliable data depicting the true HIV seroprevalence. Instead of being handicapped by the problems of inadequate data, geographical modelling of the HIV epidemic is able to rely on its theoretical understanding and good knowledge about the spatial organization and the functioning of societies to make its forecasts. Due to its flexibility of approach, geographical modelling can adjust itself to less accurate data, thus providing an interim forecasting instrument until epidemiological modelling becomes successful. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the HIV epidemic in Finland based on cartographic analysis of municipal data and the use of a simple growth model.

TI Prevention and Drug Treatment
SO FUTURE OF CHILDREN
AB Evidence linking alcohol and other drug abuse with child maltreatment, particularly neglect, is strong. But does substance abuse cause maltreatment? According to Mark Testa and Brenda Smith, such co-occurring risk factors as parental depression, social isolation, homelessness, or domestic violence may be more directly responsible than substance abuse itself for maltreatment. Interventions to prevent substance abuse-related maltreatment, say the authors, must attend to the underlying direct causes of both.
   Research on whether prevention programs reduce drug abuse or help parents control substance use and improve their parenting has had mixed results, at best. The evidence raises questions generally about the effectiveness of substance abuse services in preventing child maltreatment. Such services, for example, raise only marginally the rates at which parents are reunified with children who have been placed in foster care. The primary reason for the mixed findings, say Testa and Smith, is that almost all the parents face not only substance abuse problems but the co-occurring issues as well. To prevent recurring maltreatment and promote reunification, programs must ensure client progress in all problem areas.
   At some point in the intervention process, say Testa and Smith, attention must turn to the child's permanency needs and well-being. The best evidence to date suggests that substance-abusing parents pose no greater risk to their children than do parents of other children taken into child protective custody. It may be sensible, say the authors, to set a six-month timetable for parents to engage in treatment and allow twelve to eighteen months for them to show sufficient progress in all identified problem areas. After that, permanency plans should be expedited to place the child with a relative caregiver or in an adoptive home.
   Investing in parental recovery from substance abuse and dependence, the authors conclude, should not substitute for a comprehensive approach that addresses the multiple social and economic risks to child well-being beyond the harms associated with parental substance abuse.

TI How Uganda reversed its HIV epidemic
SO AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB Uganda is one of only two countries in the world that has successfully reversed the course of its HIV epidemic. There remains much controversy about how Uganda's HIV prevalence declined in the 1990s. This article describes the prevention programs and activities that were implemented in Uganda during critical years in its HIV epidemic, 1987 to 1994. Multiple resources were aggregated to fuel HV prevention campaigns at multiple levels to a far greater degree than in neighboring countries. We conclude that the reversed direction of the HIV epidemic in Uganda was the direct result of these interventions and that other countries in the developing world could similarly prevent or reverse the escalation of HIV epidemics with greater availability of HIV prevention resources, and well designed programs that take efforts to a critical breadth and depth of effort.

   Intervention: Research and Practice Considerations
SO SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Social workers are often on the front lines of the HIV/AIDS epidemic delivering prevention education and interventions, offering or linking individuals to HIV testing, and working to improve treatment access, retention, and adherence, especially among vulnerable populations. Individuals with substance use disorders face additional challenges to reducing sexual and drug risk behaviors, as well as barriers to testing, treatment, and antiretroviral therapy adherence. This article presents current data on HIV transmission and research evidence on prevention and intervention with substance abusers and highlights how individual social workers can take advantage of this knowledge in practice and through adoption and implementation within organizations.

TI The Cuban Response to the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa: Lessons in
   Solidarity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB In December 2013 the first case of Ebola appeared in Guinea. In September 2014 the United Nations (UN) and its specialized agency the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a call for medical collaboration in response to the medical crisis and social disaster caused by the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Cuban authorities responded immediately to the call by offering specialized help for the epidemic, in collaboration with WHO. A group of 256 Cuban doctors, nurses and other health professionals provided direct care during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Equatorial Guinea from October 2014 to April 2015. This paper explains the main features of the Cuban health system, describes the development of Cuba's international medical cooperation approach, and highlights the work done by Cuban health collaborators in addressing the damage caused by the Ebola epidemic. Information used includes reports and documents of the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba, reports of WHO and PAHO, and articles published in scientific journals and newspaper articles. The response of the Cuban medical teams to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is only one example of the Cuban efforts to strengthening health care provision in areas of need throughout the world.

TI State policies matter: The case of outpatient drug treatment program
   practices
SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB This study examined relationships between state policy requirements governing outpatient substance abuse treatment services and reported outpatient treatment program practices. State policies effective as of February 1, 2003, and February 1, 2004, were collected and analyzed via primary legal research; data were validated by state officials (88% response rate; > 90% validation rate). Treatment practice data were obtained from the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services for the years 2003 and 2004. Multivariate analyses clustered by state were conducted, controlling for state, program, and state-aggregated client admission characteristics. Results indicated that treatment programs located in states with requirements for comprehensive substance abuse assessment, family counseling, substance abuse and infectious disease/sexually transmitted disease testing services, HIV/AIDS education, and aftercare services had significantly higher odds of offering such services (p values ranging from <.05 to <.001). This study presents new information regarding the potential role that state policy context may play in understanding treatment program practices. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Behaviors Influencing Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission in the
   Context of Positive Prevention among People Living with HIV/Acquired
   Immunodeficiency Syndrome in Iran: A Qualitative Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB Background: Identifying factors, which influence health behaviors is critical to designing appropriate and effective preventive programs. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is highly related to people behaviors and understanding factors influencing healthy behaviors among Iranian people living with HIVs (PLHIVs)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is very important to tailor an effective response to HIV/AIDS epidemic.
   Methods: This study was conducted as a qualitative study by methods of focus group discussion and in-depth interview in six provinces of Iran with 64 PLHIVs to determine factors influence engagement in positive prevention.
   Results: Knowledge and education, feelings of responsibility and positive prevention practices were identified as the primary domains of engagement. These domains were found to be influenced by feelings of ostracism and frustration, poverty, barriers to disclosure of HIV status, access to and utilization of drug abuse treatment services and antiretroviral therapy, adherence to treatment, age, religiousness, sex work, singleness, and incarceration.
   Conclusions: Designing new interventions and updating current interventions directed toward the aforementioned factors should be addressed by responsible Iranian authorities in order to have a national effective response on the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Using the Kalman filter and dynamic models to assess the changing
   HIV/AIDS epidemic
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
AB Many factors, including therapy and behavioral changes, have modified the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in recent years. To include these modifications in HIV/AIDS models, in the absence of appropriate external data sources, changes over time in the parameters can be incorporated by a recursive estimation technique such as the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter accounts for stochastic fluctuations in both the model and the data and provides a means to assess any parameter modifications included in new observations. The Kalman filter approach was applied to a simple differential model to describe the observed HIV/AIDS epidemic in the homo/bisexual male community in Paris (France). This approach gave quantitative information on the time-evolution of some parameters of major epidemiological significance (average transmission rate, mean incubation rate, and basic reproduction rate), which appears quite consistent with the recent epidemiological literature.

AB Risk factors that predict vulnerability for nicotine and other drug abuse have been identified using preclinical models, and there is close agreement with clinical and epidemiological studies. The major risk factors to be discussed are age, sex/hormonal status, impulsivity, sweet-liking, novelty reactivity, proclivity for exercise, and environmental impoverishment (vs. enrichment). This discussion will focus on factors that preclinical research has determined are strong and translatable predictors of nicotine and other drug abuse. An advantage of using preclinical models is that prospective, longitudinal studies and within-subject designs can be used to reveal risk factors that are diverse yet maintain unique characteristics. The many interrelationships among these factors lead to an additive vulnerability that increases the predictability that drug abuse will occur. A feature that these risk factors have in common is that they consistently predict Vulnerability to drug abuse over critical transition phases of addiction that are difficult to examine prospectively in humans, such as acquisition, escalation, and reinstatement of drug-seeking after abstinence (relapse). The models offer valuable information that has been transferred to effective prevention and treatment strategies for smoking and other drug abuse in humans. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI POLICY ADOPTION IN DYNAMIC INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS: EVIDENCE FROM
   NATIONAL AIDS PROGRAMS
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The policy adoption is often seen as a function of internal determinants, external determinants, or a combination of the two. In the years since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic nearly every country in the world has adopted of some nature a program to combat the epidemic. This article demonstrates the mixed mechanisms influencing the adoption of AIDS pro-rams. in a quantitative study of 90 countries. Prior studies have claimed that Multilateral organizations were vital to global action against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This study provides empirical evidence showing the actions taken by the multilateral organizations have both helped and hindered efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

AB Background.  This article describes some sociomedical aspects of drug abuse and the responses that must be undertaken to control drug abuse related problems in Slovenia.
   Conclusions.  The legal and illegal drug abuse needs to be tackled at the community level.  An integrated approach that combines medical, psychological, social and other interventions to treat high-risk individuals, their families and communities and to mobilize local communities should be used.  Physicians and other primary health care workers have a key role in such efforts.  Other sectors and levels, including self-help, voluntary, social welfare and specialised activities are important.  Cleare national drug policy supported by political will, improvement of the drug prevention and treatment infrastructure, and elaborate government strategy are needed.

TI The Role of Executive Cognitive Functions in Changing Substance Use:
   What We Know and What We Need to Know
SO ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB Executive cognitive functions (ECF) have been linked to skills such as planning, organizing, problem solving, decision-making, initiating and self-regulating behavior, working memory, and motivation; critical activities needed to monitor and change substance use behavior.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate how ECF may impact important variables associated with changing substance use behavior.
   This study is a critical review of the extant literature about how ECF may influence substance abuse treatment outcomes and behavior change.
   A review of the literature found evidence that poorer ECF likely hinders substance use behavior change and is often associated with behavior labeled as denial. However, the relationship between ECF and substance abuse appears to be highly complex.
   Traditional methods of substance abuse assessment, interpretation of behavior, and intervention may need to be reconsidered in light of new research about executive cognitive dysfunction. Implications for future research are discussed.

TI Identifying the scope of ethical challenges caused by the Ebola epidemic
   2014-2016 in West Africa: a qualitative study
SO PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE
AB Background: The West African Ebola virus epidemic from 2014 to 2016 is unprecedented in its scale, surpassing all previous and subsequent Ebola outbreaks since 1976. This epidemic provoked a humanitarian emergency that extended to different spheres of life, making visible ethical challenges in addition to medical, economic, and social ones. The present article aims to identify and differentiate the scope of ethical issues associated with the Ebola epidemic. Methods: An online media analysis was performed on articles published from March 2014 to September 2015 in ten preselected academic journals (scientific press) and two online newspapers (lay press). Two methodological approaches were combined: a systematic literature search and a qualitative content analysis. An additional keyword search was conducted on the PubMed database for the period after the end of the Ebola epidemic (2016-2020) to obtain an overview of research dealing with medical ethics due to the epidemic and to compare these results with the identified ethical challenges. Results: A total of 389 articles dealing with the subject fields "Ebola epidemic " and "ethics " were researched. For qualitative content analysis, the time span with the highest article density was selected and a total of 64 articles were included (15 scientific articles, 49 popular articles). Five core ethical challenges of the Ebola epidemic emerged: 1. Responsibility and Accountability, 2. Spillover Effects, 3. Research and Development, 4. Health Communication, and 5. Resource Allocation. Articles in academic journals were dominated by the discussion of normative aspects in the area of "research and development ", while newspaper articles focused on aspects of "responsibility and accountability ". Conclusion: An ethical discussion of the Ebola epidemic requires an examination of as many of the ethical dimensions involved as possible. The presented investigation of the two types of media with regard to the Ebola epidemic offers this possibility of a more comprehensive insight into this diversity as a basis for ethical discussions.

TI Bariatric surgery and alcohol and substance abuse disorder: A systematic
   review
SO CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
AB Introduction: Bariatric surgery is a relatively safe surgical procedure with a high success rate. However, recent reports indicate a higher prevalence of alcohol or substance abuse disorder in this patient group. The purpose of this study was to review the related evidence to serve as a reference for multidisciplinary teams who treat these patients.
   Methods: We searched the PubMed and CENTRAL databases. The odds ratios were extracted from the different articles, comparing the prevalence of the abuse of alcohol or other substances in the postoperative period versus preoperative levels. We also compared the prevalence of alcohol use disorder after different types of bariatric surgery.
   Results: A total of 49 121 bariatric patients (80.8% female) were evaluated for alcohol use disorder. In general, bariatric surgery was found to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of alcohol abuse (4.58 +/- 5.3 vs. 1.58 +/- 10.7% in the preoperative period). We also found that the population of patients who underwent RYGB procedures had a higher prevalence of alcohol use disorder than patients who underwent another type of surgery (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.51-2.21). The prevalence of substance abuse disorder (other than alcohol) after this procedure is less studied, although there appears to be an increased risk of abuse of certain substances.
   Conclusions: Bariatric surgery is the best treatment for obesity and its complications. The evidence reviewed suggests that it correlates with a modest but consistent increase in the prevalence of abuse of alcohol and other substances. Medical teams who treat bariatric patients must be informed about this eventuality for its timely prevention, diagnosis and treatment. (C) 2021 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI Pilot evaluation of a substance abuse prevention group intervention for
   at-risk bariatric surgery candidates
SO SURGERY FOR OBESITY AND RELATED DISEASES
AB Background: Concerns have been raised about an increased incidence of substance abuse after bariatric surgery. Alcohol use after surgery may be particularly problematic because of changes in pharmacokinetics leading to greater intoxication. The present study evaluated a substance abuse prevention group pilot intervention for at-risk bariatric surgery candidates
   Methods: Patients with a history of substance abuse/dependence or at-risk substance use applying for weight loss surgery (WLS; N = 86) were referred to a single-session 90-minute intervention (67.4% female; 65.1% Caucasian; mean age 46.2 years; mean body mass index 48.77 kg/m(2)). The session included education about the health effects of alcohol/substances on WLS outcomes, developing alternative coping strategies, identifying warning signs of misuse, and providing treatment resources. Patients completed a preintervention and postintervention questionnaire measuring knowledge of substance use health effects, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Items, and items on motivation for abstinence.
   Results: Patients reported a significant increase in knowledge regarding the negative effects of substance abuse after surgery (t = 42.34; P < .001). Patients also reported more healthy alternative coping strategies after the intervention (t = 18.96; P < .001). In addition, a significant number of patients reported a lower intention of consuming alcohol after surgery (chi(2) = 16.18; P < .001) and were more likely to report health reasons as motivation to abstain (chi(2) = 102.89; P < .001).
   Conclusions: At-risk patients applying for weight loss surgery may benefit from a substance abuse prevention intervention. More research will be needed to see if such benefits can be sustained over time and if interventions affect postsurgical behaviors. (C) 2013 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

SO SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objectives: To assess knowledge and attitude of Primary Health Care (PHC) physicians about commonly abused drugs in the community and to assess their ability to detect abuse and abuse behavior.
   Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Setting: Twenty-five PHC centers in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. Subjects: One hundred and forty physicians from randomly selected PHC Centers. These physicians participated by filling out a self administered questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measures: Knowledge of main features of substance abuse, reported cases of substance abuse, and attitudes of PHC physicians towards managing this problem.
   Results: Sixty-nine percent of PHC physicians are of the opinion that substance abuse is a common and expanding problem. Most participating physicians think that substance abuse is a problem of young males. Although most PHC physicians have a satisfactory factual knowledge about features of dependence, only 23% of them have actually seen a substance abuser in the last 12 months in their practice; giving a prevalence rate of one per 1000. Male physicians in the age group under 30 years and more than 50 years, and those having postgraduate qualifications, were more able to detect abuse behavior. Most commonly reported substances of abuse were: alcohol, amphetamines, volatile substances and heroin. Most of the participating physicians underestimated the role of the PHC system in the management of substance abuse. Conclusion: Training and further studies are required to improve prevention and early treatment.

CT 16th International AIDS Conference
CY AUG 13-18, 2006
CL Toronto, CANADA
AB Although stigma is considered a major barrier to effective responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, stigma reduction efforts are relegated to the bottom of AIDS programme priorities. The complexity of HIV/AIDS-related stigma is often cited as a primary reason for the limited response to this pervasive phenomenon. In this paper, we systematically review the scientific literature on HIV/AIDS-related stigma to document the Current state of research, identify gaps in the available evidence and highlight promising strategies to address stigma. We focus on the following key challenges: defining, measuring and reducing HIV/AIDS-related stigma as well as assessing the impact of stigma on the effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment programmes. Based on the literature, we conclude by offering a set of recommendations that may represent important next steps in a multifaceted response to stigma in the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs: The role of the pediatrician in
   prevention and management of substance abuse
SO PEDIATRICS
AB During the past three decades, the responsibility of pediatricians to their patients and their patients' families regarding the prevention of substance abuse and the diagnosis and management of problems related to substance abuse has increased. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has highlighted the importance of such issues in a variety of ways, including its guidelines for preventive services. Nonetheless, many pediatricians remain reluctant to address this issue. The harmful consequences of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use are a concern of medical professionals who care for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. Thus, pediatricians should include discussion of substance abuse as a part of routine health care, starting with the prenatal visit and as a part of ongoing anticipatory guidance. Knowledge of the extent and nature of the consequences of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use as well as the physical, psychological, and social consequences is important for pediatricians. Pediatricians should incorporate substance abuse prevention into daily practice, acquire the skills necessary to identify young people at risk for substance abuse, and provide or obtain assessment, intervention, and treatment as necessary.

TI Impact of HIV co-infection on the evolution and transmission of
   multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
SO ELIFE
AB The tuberculosis (TB) epidemic is fueled by a parallel Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic, but it remains unclear to what extent the HIV epidemic has been a driver for drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we assess the impact of HIV co-infection on the emergence of resistance and transmission of Mtb in the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB in South America to date. By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction of transmission networks utilizing a new model optimized for TB, we find that HIV co-infection does not significantly affect the transmissibility or the mutation rate of Mtb within patients and was not associated with increased emergence of resistance within patients. Our results indicate that the HIV epidemic serves as an amplifier of TB outbreaks by providing a reservoir of susceptible hosts, but that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver for the emergence and transmission of resistant strains.

AB Major research findings show gaps in health services research on the prevalence and outcomes of patient- and organization-level human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug abuse prevention and treatment services. The latest thrust of health services research on translational research issues includes informing and training practitioners about new, proven drug abuse treatment interventions; changing treatment organizations ( creating a climate for change and building a culture to sustain change); and financing new treatments. Findings defining the direct relationship between the quality of drug abuse treatment and the patients' program completion, the perception of the staff by the patient, feelings of self-empowerment and mitigation of patient and organizational readiness, the superiority of integrated care, and the primary reasons for delays in HIV-infected substance-using patients seeking care are included. More needs to be done to increase the participation of substance abuse programs in teaching about and implementing HIV prevention and developing means to modulate or eliminate barriers to the integration of HIV and substance abuse care.

TI Spirituality and religiosity in the context of drug abuse
SO REV RENE
AB Objective: to investigate the influence of spirituality/religiosity in the context of drug abuse. Methods: this is an integrative review, conducted on the databases Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences and SCOPUS. The following descriptors were used in the Portuguese and English languages: drug users, spirituality, religion, drug abuse treatment centers and treatment outcome. Results: eight articles were analyzed, among which there was a prevalence of publications of the year 2015 and of quantitative studies. The studies approached mainly the prevention of drug abuse, the change of the user's behavior and the religious/spiritual confrontation. Conclusion: spirituality/religiosity seems to be a positive factor for drug users facing treatment, as well as in the protection against the abusive use of these psychoactive substances.

TI A Historical Perspective on Offender Drug Abuse Treatment
SO HANDBOOK OF EVIDENCE-BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE
   SETTINGS
SE Issues in Childrens and Families Lives
AB The nexus between substance abuse and crime has its roots in the nineteenth century when alcohol was seen as a problem that contributed to crime. In the twenty-first century, there is a need to continue to seek magical solutions that will "break the cycle" of substance abuse and crime. The research conducted and collected from programs and interventions has been established over the years and indicates there is evidence that what works, and what does not work with the offender population has been proven. A historical review of what has been done throughout the years to reduce the impact of the drug abusing offender underscores this knowledge. This review demonstrates that "effective" programs have been developed, and redeveloped under different names throughout the last quarter of a century. Today there is the opportunity to bring together researchers, programmers and funders to develop evidence-based program infrastructures, implementation plans, performance standards, training and evaluation knowledge to develop strong, evidence-based foundations for designing future operations, programs and interventions.

TI Prediction of suicidality and violence in hospitalized adolescents:
   Comparisons by sex
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
AB Objective: To examine psychological correlates of suicidality and violent behaviour in hospitalized adolescents and the extent to which these associations may be affected by their sex.
   Method: A sample of 487 psychiatric inpatients (207 male, 280 female), aged 12 to 19 years, completed a battery of psychometrically sound self-report measures of psychological functioning, substance abuse, suicidality, and violent behaviour. We conducted multiple regression analyses to determine the joint and independent predictors of suicide risk and violence risk. In subsequent analyses, we examined these associations separately by sex.
   Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that 9 variables (sex, age, hopelessness, self-esteem, depression, impulsivity, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and violence risk) jointly predicted suicide risk and that an analogous model predicted violence risk. However, we found several differences with respect to which variables made significant independent contributions to these 2 predictive models. Female sex, low self-esteem, depression, drug abuse, and violence risk made independent contributions to suicide risk. Male sex, younger age, hopelessness, impulsivity, drug abuse, and suicide risk made independent contributions to violence risk. We observed a few additional differences when we considered male and female subjects separately.
   Conclusions: We found overlapping but distinctive patterns of prediction for suicide risk and violence risk, as well as some differences between male and female subjects. These results may reflect distinct psychological and behavioural pathways for suicidality and violence in adolescent psychiatric patients and differing risk factors for each sex. Such differences have potential implications for prevention and treatment programs.

TI Substance Abuse Treatment Clinician Opinions and Infectious Disease
   Service Delivery
SO JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES
AB Substance abuse treatment programs are an important platform for delivery of services for infectious diseases associated with drug and alcohol use. However, important components of infectious disease care are not universally provided. Clinician training often focuses on information about infectious diseases and less attention is paid to provider opinions and attitudes that may be barriers to providing infectious diseases services. In a national multi-site trial conducted by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), we investigated the relationship between clinician opinions and the delivery of services for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and sexually transmitted infections in substance abuse treatment settings. Survey data were collected from 1,723 clinicians at 269 CTN treatment programs. Clinician opinion was found to be significantly related to infectious disease service delivery. Implications for training are discussed.

AB The study of the threshold dynamic co-epidemic of the HIV-TB is important to understand how the disease is related, and how prevention and treatment is most effective. In this paper, the mathematical model can be used to provide insight into the dynamics of co-epidemic HIV-TB is the most effective. In particular, we examined the effects of re-infection of TB in the susceptible heterosexual population. We have obtained the effect re-infection TB in heterosexual population significant to the magnitude of the basic reproduction number. In a simulation model of the rate of transition from exposed to active TB is much shorter than the transition from individual latent HIV to individuals with HIV less attention. Co-epidemic HIV-TB in this paper describes the importance of including the re-infection TB and effects of HIV on TB and vice versa on the transmission and progression of the HIV and TB epidemic.

TI Towards an integrated framework for accelerating the end of the global
   HIV epidemic among young people
SO SEX EDUCATION-SEXUALITY SOCIETY AND LEARNING
AB For decades, the HIV epidemic has exacted an enormous toll worldwide. However, trend analyses have discerned significant declines in the overall prevalence of HIV over the last two decades. More recently, advances in biomedical, behavioural, and structural interventions offer considerable promise in the battle against generalised epidemics. Despite advances in the prevention of transmission and new infections, morbidity and mortality of HIV among young people remains a considerable concern for individuals, couples, families, communities, practitioners, and policy-makers around the globe. To accelerate the end of the global HIV epidemic among young people, we must merge existing efficacious interventions with more novel, cost-effective implementation strategies to develop integrated, multi-level combination interventions. The benefits of conceptualising the HIV epidemic more broadly and adopting ecological frameworks for the development of HIV prevention programmes are critical.

TI AN EVALUATION OF IMMEDIATE OUTCOMES AND FIDELITY OF A DRUG ABUSE
   PREVENTION PROGRAM IN CONTINUATION HIGH SCHOOLS: PROJECT TOWARDS NO DRUG
   ABUSE (TND)
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG EDUCATION
AB The present study provides an implementation fidelity, process, and immediate outcomes evaluation of Project Towards No Drug Abuse (TND), a drug prevention program targeting continuation high school youth (n = 1426) at risk for drug abuse. A total of 24 schools participated in three randomized conditions: TND Only, TND and motivational interviewing follow-up, and no treatment control. Fidelity was high: across program schools the curriculum was implemented as intended and was received favorably by students. Relative to controls, intervention conditions produced effects on hypothesized mediators, including greater gains in program related knowledge, greater reductions in drug use intentions, and positive changes in motivation. However, few generalizations to attitudes and intentions regarding risky sexual behavior were found. The pattern of results suggests that the experimental manipulations worked as intended.

TI Substance abuse relapse in a ten-year prospective follow-up of clients
   with mental and substance use disorders
SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
AB Objectives: This study addressed the rate and predictors of substance abuse relapse among clients with severe mental illness who had attained full remission from substance abuse. Methods: In a ten-year prospective follow-up study of clients with co-occurring severe mental and substance use disorders, 169 clients who had attained full remission, defined according to DSM-III-R as at least six months without evidence of abuse or dependence, were identified. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was developed to show the pattern of relapse, and a discrete-time survival analysis was used to identify predictors of relapse. Results: Approximately one-third of clients who were in full remission relapsed in the first year, and two-thirds relapsed over the full follow-up period. Predictors of relapse included male sex, less than a high school education, living independently, and lack of continued substance abuse treatment. Conclusions: After attaining full remission, clients with severe mental disorders continue to be at risk of substance abuse relapse for many years. Relapse prevention efforts should concentrate on helping clients to continue with substance abuse treatment as well as on developing housing programs that promote recovery.

TI STOCHASTIC-MODELS OF HIV EPIDEMIC IN HOMOSEXUAL POPULATIONS - THE
   EFFECTS OF MIXING PATTERNS
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB Extending my previous work [1-3], in this paper I proceed to develop a stochastic model for HIV epidemic in a homosexual population under general conditions. Through computer generated data, I assess various deterministic models as compared with the expected numbers of the stochastic models. It is shown that different mixing patterns have significant impacts on the HIV epidemic except possibly restricted mixing. Thus, in populations with preferred mixing (mixing proportion less than 1) and with proportional mixing, the numbers of S people, L people, I people and A people differ significantly from the corresponding expected numbers of the stochastic models. For the L people, I people and A people, the numbers of the deterministic models first appear to be smaller and later appear to be larger than the corresponding mean numbers of the stochastic models, indicating that while in the short run the deterministic models would underestimate the true numbers, in the long run the deterministic models would overestimate the true numbers.

TI Political and socio-economic instability: does it have a role in the
   HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa? Case studies from selected
   countries
SO SAHARA J-JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ASPECTS OF HIV-AIDS
AB Many sub-Saharan African countries are confronted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This article reviews academic literature in the social sciences and health to discover why HIV/AIDS has become an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and not in other parts of the world. This was studied by examining the social determinants of diminishment of tradition and social cohesion in terms of political, social and economic problems. Four countries in this region were selected for this case study, namely South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The findings showed that instability in socio-economic and political aspects in these nations was responsible for creating a suitable environment for the spread of HIV/AIDS infection. This paper concludes by using the theories of collective action/responsibility and social cohesion to hypothesise that the breakdown of social ties due to various kinds of conflicts and unrest is one of the main contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI A review of the clinical and epidemiologic burdens of epidemic malaria
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB The role of epidemic malaria as a distinct epidemiologic entity posing unique intervention challenges is reviewed from a global perspective. Epidemic malaria derives from particular interactions of vectors, parasites, and various environmental and anthropogenic determinants. Malaria epidemics generally afflict immunologically vulnerable populations, and their explosiveness can strain the capacity of health facilities, causing case fatality rates to increase five-fold or more during outbreaks. People of all ages remain susceptible to the full range of clinical effects. This flatter demographic profile may translate into larger economic consequences, although the full economic impact of epidemic malaria remains undefined. Specialized intervention approaches are recommended for epidemic-prone areas, including enhanced surveillance activities and intensified antivector interventions. Such considerations are particularly critical during a time when malaria epidemics are occurring more frequently in Africa and throughout the world.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION
AB In Africa, epidemiological data on the effect of the HIV epidemic on the occurrence of lymphomas are scanty. The 1990s witnessed the alarming rates of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria increased from 1.8% in 1991 to 4.4% in 2005. The aim of this study was to determine whether there have been any changes in the frequency and pattern of lymphomas in view of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country. This is a retrospective study of all lymphoma cases diagnosed during 1991-2005. The prevalence of lymphomas declined from 1.4% to 0.7% of surgical biopsies during 1991-2005. There was a decline in the proportion of high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma from 79.1% and 45.8% respectively to 21.1% and 13.6% respectively. There is a suggestion that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country may not have influenced the pattern of occurrence of both major histomorphological types of lymphoma in Ibadan.

TI A stochastic model of the HIV epidemic for heterosexual transmission

   model of the HIV epidemic
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB This is a follow-up paper of Tan and Zhu [1] in which we have considered a large population consisting of single males, single females, married couples, and prostitutes. For assessing effects of risk factors on the HIV epidemic by heterosexual transmission and the role of prostitutes in this paper, we have developed chain multinomial models for the HIV epidemic in these populations. Through Monte Carlo studies, we have shown that prostitutes form a stepping stone for the HIV epidemic by heterosexual transmission. Among the risk factors affecting HIV prevalence, our numerical results have indicated that the frequency of condom use is the most important factor followed by the number of sexual partners per unit time. Thus, promoting condom use among prostitutes may serve as a major avenue to control the spread of HIV through heterosexual transmission.

TI HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB Health services research is a multidisciplinary field that examines ways to organize, manage, finance, and deliver high-quality care. This specialty within substance abuse research developed from policy analyses and needs assessments that shaped federal policy and promoted system development in the 1970s. After the authorization of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), patient information systems supported studies of treatment processes and outcomes. Health services research grew substantially in the 1990s when NIAAA and NIDA moved into the National Institutes of Health, and legislation allocated 15% of their research portfolio to services research. The next decade will emphasize research on quality of care, adoption and use of evidence-based practices (including medication), financing reforms, and integration of substance abuse treatment with primary care and mental health services.

By using this PGF, it is shown that the expected values, the variances and the covariances of the latent persons, infective persons and AIDS cases satisfy some ordinary differential equations.  These equations have been solved numerically to assess effects of various factors on the AIDS epidemic.

TI Assessing the effects of drug misuse on HIV/AIDS prevalence
SO THEORY IN BIOSCIENCES
AB Drug misuse (injecting drug users-IDU) has been recognized to have a significant effect on the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic. A deterministic model to assess the contribution of drug misuse and sex in the spread of HIV/AIDS is investigated. The threshold parameters of the model are determined and stabilities are analysed. Analysis of the reproduction number has shown that increase in drug misuse results in an increase in HIV infections. Furthermore, numerical simulations of the model show that drug misuse enhances HIV transmission and progression to AIDS. Thus, in a population with intravenous drug users, advocating for safe sex alone will not be enough to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Precipitants of Substance Abuse Relapse in Ghana: A Qualitative

SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB Relapse to substance abuse is a global problem and is conceptualized as an integral component of the recovery process. Global statistics on rates of relapse after substance abuse treatment are disturbingly high, averaging about 75% within a 3- to 6-month duration after treatment. This study sought to gain full understanding of the factors that precipitate relapse among substance abusers in Ghana. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 15 relapsed substance abusers who were previously treated for substance abuse, and three mental health professionals at a psychiatric rehabilitation unit in Ghana. Findings showed that seven factors, including positive/negative emotional reinforcements, sense of loss, interpersonal conflicts, peer influence, familial, religio-cultural, and treatment-based issues complot to instigate and maintain the relapse cycle. The findings provide valuable insights into the relapse phenomenon in Ghana. Clinicians should actively engage family members in the relapse prevention process, and provide insight into religio-cultural relapse precipitants.

TI Urban and Rural Utilization of Evidence-Based Practices for Substance
   Use and Mental Health Disorders
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
AB Purpose: The purpose of the investigation was to examine variations in evidence-based practice (EBP) utilization between rural and urban mental health and substance abuse prevention provider agencies in Washington State.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2007 EBP Survey, which was administered to 250 of Washington State Department of Social and Health Services' contracted mental health and substance abuse treatment agencies. The survey solicited input from solo and group practices across the state on EBP implementation, successes, and challenges.
   Findings: Most mental health and substance abuse treatment agencies used more than 1 EBP, although rural substance abuse agencies were less likely to do so than urban agencies. Rural substance abuse agencies were more likely to be solo than group practices. Urban agencies reporting significantly more collaboration with universities for EBP training, although training by internal staff was the most commonly reported training mechanism regardless of agency focus or location. Over half of agencies reported conducting no systematic assessment of EBPs, and of those who did report systematic assessment, most used outcome monitoring more than program evaluation or benchmarking. Urban and rural mental health and substance abuse prevention providers reported shortages of appropriately trained workforce and financing issues available to pay for EBPs as the greatest barriers to utilization.
   Conclusions: Challenges to EBP utilization and fidelity should be monitored as EBPs contribute to the delivery of high-quality care. Collaborations between universities and rural agencies may support an agency's abilities to adopt EBPs, train staff, and systematically assess impact.

TI The Time is Now: Improving Substance Abuse Training in Medical Schools
SO ACADEMIC PSYCHIATRY
AB This commentary highlights the growing demand for substance abuse prevention and treatment, summarizes the literature regarding the current insufficiencies in substance abuse training in medical schools, and suggests strategies to address this gap in physician education. The authors describe how the combination of mandated coverage for substance abuse services and expanding treatment needs means that more physicians, regardless of their patient populations, will be faced with addressing the problem of substance use. The authors review the literature on substance abuse training in medical schools, which indicates insufficient exposure to this topic. The authors describe how current substance abuse training at medical schools is focused on transmitting scientific knowledge with relatively little education or training in attitudes and skills central to effective prevention and treatment. Given the gap between clinical need and physician education, the authors suggest several strategies for medical schools to increase training in substance abuse knowledge, attitudes, and skills, which will enhance the practice of evidence-based care. The authors posit that medical curricular reform, combined with initiatives to change clinical culture around substance abuse, will translate into improved rates of screening, shorter overall length of treatment, effective referrals for continued treatment, and increased access to care for individuals who use substances and so reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with substance use.

TI Addressing the Unique Needs of African American Women in HIV Prevention
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB African American women continue to be disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, yet there are few effective HIV prevention interventions that are exclusively tailored to their lives and that address their risk factors.
   Using an ecological framework, we offer a comprehensive overview of the risk factors that are driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic among African American women and explicate the consequences of ignoring these factors in HIV prevention strategies.
   We also recommend ways to improve HIV prevention programs by taking into consideration the unique life experiences of adult African American women. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:996-1001. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.140541)

CY OCT 07-10, 2009
CL Zadar, CROATIA
AB For the past several years a numerous studies in the field of forensic psychiatry confirmed a close relationship between violent offenders and comorbid substance abuse. The comorbid substance abuse in violent offenders was usually unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Furthermore, comorbidity in forensic psychiatry describes the co-occurrence of two or more conditions or psychiatric disorder known in the literature as dual diagnosis and defined by World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, many violent offenders have multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Recent studies have confirmed causal relationship between major psychiatric disorders and concomitant substance abuse (comorbidity) in 50-80% of forensic cases. In general, there is a high level of psychiatric comorbidity in forensic patients with prevalence of personality disorders (50-90%), mood disorders (20-60%) and psychotic disorders (15-20%) coupled with substance abuse disorders. Moreover, the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities could be found in mentally retarded individuals, as well as, in epileptic patients. Drugs and alcohol abuse can produce serious psychotoxic effects that may lead to extreme violent behavior and consequently to serious criminal offence such as physical assault, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder and homicide, all due to an altered brain function and generating psychotic-like symptoms. Studies have confirmed a significant statistical relevance in causal relationship between substance abuse and violent offences. In terms of forensic psychiatry, the comorbidity strongly contributes in the process of establishing psychiatric diagnosis of diminished mental capacity or insanity at the time of the offence in the course of clinical assessment and evaluation of violent offenders. Today, the primary focus of forensic psychiatry treatment services (inpatient or community) is management of the violent offenders with psychiatric comorbidity which requires a multilevel, evidence based approach to the patient. Forensic treatment service effectiveness appears to be associated with individual case management and approach including psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and occupational therapy in order to achieve optimal rehabilitation, prevention of recidivism and stability in social functioning of the patient in the community.

TI Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus services offered by substance

SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB Although substance abuse treatment programs are important contact points for providing health services for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, availability of services in these programs has not been well characterized. This study evaluated the spectrum of HBV and HCV services offered by substance abuse treatment programs within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. Our survey of substance abuse treatment program administrators covered availability of testing for HBV and HCV; hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HBV immunization; and HCV medical and nonmedical services. There were also questions covering clarity of guidelines for HBV and HCV testing and HAV and HBV immunization. Differences between methadone and nonmethadone programs were examined. Despite the importance of substance abuse in sustaining the hepatitis epidemics, few programs offer comprehensive HBV and HCV testing or HCV health care services. Interventions to improve access to hepatitis services for substance-abusing patients are needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the most heavily affected area of tropical (sub-Saharan) Africa the situation is getting worse. There is a number of factors which are responsible for this situation.
   Considering the lack of necessary funds, it is evident that the most important task is a vigorous health education.

CY MAY 29-JUN 01, 1994
CL QUEBEC CITY, CANADA

AB Individuals use and misuse alcohol (and other drugs) because of the pharmacologically mediated effects these substances have on the operation of 4 psychobiological systems, mediating response to motivationally relevant unconditioned and conditioned stimuli. These 4 systems have unique neuroanatomical structure, biochemical modes of operation, association with affect, behavior and cognition, and responsiveness to drugs of abuse. Individual variation in the operation of these systems determines individual susceptibility to initiation and maintenance of drug use and abuse. Sources of such variation differ, in a vitally important fashion, in various specific populations of individuals at heightened risk for drug abuse, Nonalcoholic sons of male alcoholics, with multigenerational family histories of male alcoholism, appear to be at heightened risk for the development of alcohol abuse because alcohol eliminates their heightened response to threat, and because they are hypersensitive to ethanol's psychomotor stimulant effects. Anxiety-sensitive individuals also appear attracted to alcohol for its anxiolytic properties. Many other important sources of idiosyncratic variability exist. Detailed analysis of such sources may lead to the development of more effective prevention and treatment programs.

TI A Comparison of Bayesian Spatial Models for HIV Mapping in South Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Despite making significant progress in tackling its HIV epidemic, South Africa, with 7.7 million people living with HIV, still has the biggest HIV epidemic in the world. The Government, in collaboration with developmental partners and agencies, has been strengthening its responses to the HIV epidemic to better target the delivery of HIV care, treatment strategies and prevention services. Population-based household HIV surveys have, over time, contributed to the country's efforts in monitoring and understanding the magnitude and heterogeneity of the HIV epidemic. Local-level monitoring of progress made against HIV and AIDS is increasingly needed for decision making. Previous studies have provided evidence of substantial subnational variation in the HIV epidemic. Using HIV prevalence data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey, we compare three spatial smoothing models, namely, the intrinsically conditionally autoregressive normal, Laplace and skew-t (ICAR-normal, ICAR-Laplace and ICAR-skew-t) in the estimation of the HIV prevalence across 52 districts in South Africa. The parameters of the resulting models are estimated using Bayesian approaches. The skewness parameter for the ICAR-skew-t model was not statistically significant, suggesting the absence of skewness in the HIV prevalence data. Based on the deviance information criterion (DIC) model selection, the ICAR-normal and ICAR-Laplace had DIC values of 291.3 and 315, respectively, which were lower than that of the ICAR-skewed t (348.1). However, based on the model adequacy criterion using the conditional predictive ordinates (CPO), the ICAR-skew-t distribution had the lowest CPO value. Thus, the ICAR-skew-t was the best spatial smoothing model for the estimation of HIV prevalence in our study.

TI Addressing Substance Abuse Among Nursing Students: Development of a
   Prototype Alternative-to-Dismissal Policy
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
AB Substance abuse and dependency are health issues that require effective policies within nursing education. In 2007, the University of Memphis School of Nursing drafted a new substance abuse policy using the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's Policy and Guidelines for Prevention and Management of Substance Abuse in the Nursing Education Community. These guidelines include the assumption that addiction is an illness that can be treated and the philosophy that schools of nursing are committed to assisting students with recovery. The new policy at University of Memphis School of Nursing incorporated prevention, education, identification, evaluation, treatment referral, and reentry guidelines, as well as disciplinary action for students unwilling to undergo rehabilitation. It is hoped this new substance abuse policy will serve as a prototype for other institutions.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Spirituality is presumed by millions of Americans to be directly relevant to problems of alcohol abuse. We summarize findings regarding the role of religion and spirituality in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse and present a case illustration. We also consider mechanisms responsible for these effects. We offer advice about why, by whom, and how religion and spirituality should be discussed with clients with substance use disorders. In a recent clinical trial, therapists trained in a client-centered approach to facilitate exploration of spirituality fostered clients' use of spiritual practices. We suggest that the therapist's ability to skillfully engage clients in a discussion of spirituality is largely determined by how the therapist balances the dual roles of authoritative expert and evocative facilitator.

TI Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment within the Criminal Justice
   System: An Overview of the Issues
SO JOURNAL OF ADDICTIONS NURSING
AB Many nurses, especially those in addictions, work directly in the prison system and or relate to inmates before or after institutionalization for criminal activity. This connection led to the theme of the 2009 Annual Education Conference held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, entitled "Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment: Working with the Criminal Justice Systems." The conference was partially funded through an award from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (grant # SP015963) and focused on identifying the special risk factors for and barriers to the treatment of addictions for those who enter the criminal justice system. The conference, presented in collaboration with the American Association of Nurse Attorneys (AANA) highlighted the tremendous need for more access to addictions and mental health providers in the criminal justice system. Papers presented at that conference confirmed that nurses can make a real difference in the health of inmates, especially those of us engaged in addictions and mental health practices, and inspired this specially focused edition of the Journal of Addictions Nursing. The purpose of this editorial is to provide an overview of the addictions problems affecting individuals under supervision in the criminal justice system, barriers to treatment within this system, and the cost-benefits of evidence based treatment.

AB We discuss the dynamic of a stochastic hepatitis B epidemic model. A stochastic hepatitis B model is formulated with a varying population environment for a long term behavior. The proposed model consists of three classes, namely the susceptible individuals in which the transmission rate is distributed by white noise, the infected individuals in which the same perturbation occurs and the recovered individuals. We derive sufficient conditions for the extinction and the persistence. Finally, we carry out the numerical simulations to support our analytical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background/Objectives: HIV continues to be a significant problem among substance users and their sexual partners in the United States. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) offers a national platform for effectiveness trials of HIV interventions in community substance abuse treatment programs. This article presents the HIV activities of the CTN during its first 10 years. Results: While emphasizing CTN HIV protocols, this article reviews the (1) HIV context for this work; (2) the collaborative process among providers, researchers, and National Institute on Drug Abuse CTN staff, on which CTN HIV work was based; (3) results of CTN HIV protocols and HIV secondary analyses in CTN non-HIV protocols; and (4) implications for future HIV intervention effectiveness research in community substance abuse treatment programs. Conclusion/Significance: While the feasibility of engaging frontline providers in this research is highlighted, the limitations of small to medium effect sizes and weak adoption and sustainability in everyday practice are also discussed.

TI Substance use disorders in Saudi Arabia: review article
SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE
AB Objective: The objective was to review all the available published studies and reports with particular reference to substance abuse in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: Data were collected from a PubMed search and reviewing national journals, the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) reports, World Health Organization (WHO) reports and conference presentations over the last two decades.
   Results: Among Saudi patients in addiction treatment settings, the most commonly abused substances were amphetamine (4-70.7%,), heroin (6.6-83.6%), alcohol (9-70.3%) and cannabis (1-60%). Over the past decade, there was an increase in the use of cannabis and amphetamine and decrease in the use of heroin and volatile substances. Peer pressure and psychosocial stresses were risk factors for initiation as well as relapse of substance abuse. Anxiety, depression and hepatitis were the most common co-morbid disorders among the Saudi patients.
   Conclusion: Substance abuse is a public health problem in Saudi Arabia. It was associated with many psychiatric disorders, medical diseases and educational, occupational, legal and social consequences. School-and community-based prevention programmes are highly required in Saudi Arabia as a first-line strategy in the fight against substance abuse.

TI Integrating harm reduction therapy and traditional substance abuse
   treatment
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
AB One-size-fits-all therapy has not worked well for a majority of substance users seeking help. New approaches to substance abuse treatment are desperately needed. Traditional models of service delivery offer little, if any, help to people who may not choose abstinence as a goal. To address this concern, the Bridging the Gap Conference was sponsored by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The overall goals of the conference were to improve standards of care, develop best practice principles for integrating harm reduction approaches into traditional substance abuse services, and increase the accessibility of quality services to people in need of alcohol and drug treatment. G. Alan Marlatt gave a keynote address on the integration of harm reduction therapy into traditional treatment services, an expanded version of which is presented in this article. Such integration would broaden the scope of services available to a larger group of consumers of substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, harm reduction therapy would infuse traditional treatment practices with scientifically-based pragmatism that pays close attention to individual and community public health needs. Because of its tolerance of treatment goals other thatn abstinence, harm reduction therapy offers the greatest hope to expand the availability of substance abuse services to people who have not benefited from traditional abstinence-based treatment models.

TI Economic evaluation of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention programs
   in pregnant women: A systematic review
SO ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
AB Drug abuse and transmission of HIV during pregnancy are public health problems that adversely affect pregnant women, their children and surrounding communities. Programs that address this vulnerable population have the ability to be cost-effective due to resulting cost savings for mother, child and society. Economic evaluations of programs that address these issues are an important tool to better understand the costs of services and create sustainable healthcare systems. This study critically examined economic evaluations of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention programs in pregnant women. A systematic review was conducted using the criteria recommended by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine and the British Medical Journal (BMJ) checklist for economic evaluations. The search identified 6 economic studies assessing drug abuse treatment for pregnant women, and 12 economic studies assessing programs that focus on prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. Results show that many programs for drug abuse treatment and PMTCT among pregnant women are cost-effective or even cost-saving. This study identified several shortcomings in methodology and lack of standardization of current economic evaluations. Efforts to address methodological challenges will help make future studies more comparable and have more influence on policy makers, clinicians and the public. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Substance abuse and dependence remains an important public health concern because of health-related and other costs to our society. We review selected articles that address questions about the psychosocial treatment of substance abuse disorders; these articles could aid in setting the parameters of a national health care insurance. Data from major program evaluation studies of existing substance abuse treatment programs are presented, followed by reviews of controlled studies of opiate, cocaine, and marijuana abuse and dependence; particular attention is given to studies that have standardized treatment through the use of treatment manuals. Articles about the treatment of substance abuse in adolescents are also reviewed. The existing data suggest that substance abuse treatment should be intensive and should probably involve multiple modalities targeted to various problems encountered in patients with substance use disorders, including comorbid psychiatric problems. However, only a few well-controlled studies have been performed to dale; therefore, substantial research is needed before a system truly informed by research can be designed. Suggestions for future research directions are provided.

The employer costs associated with substance abuse remain high owing to rising health costs, accidents, absenteeism, and workers' compensation claims placing the organisation and its employees at risk for harm. This article describes the status of current policy, prevention, and treatment interventions to address substance abuse in the South African workplace. Key issues highlighted are the need for research into the extent and impact of substance abuse in the South African workforce, the promotion of substance abuse policies that are comprehensive in nature, and the need to upscale prevention and treatment initiatives through a move away from a traditional labour approach to addressing substance-related disorders in the workplace to the adoption of a more public health approach. Cost-effectiveness of substance abuse interventions is explored alongside the importance of ensuring that employers, practitioners, and other role players engage with the evidence of what works using international standards as the basis.

I consider how the contemporary apparatus constructed to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Vietnam, one funded by the United States, operates by inducing adherence to a new regime that turns on subjectivation and risk calculation.

SO AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
AB This article reviews the epidemic of HIV infection and AIDS, the Chinese national policy development in response to the epidemic, and disparities between policies and the need for AIDS prevention in China. The HIV epidemic in China has gone through three phases, and it is now at the rapid expansion phase. Since 1988, HIV/AIDS has been addressed from a legal perspective, but in the early stages laws and regulations actually hindered HIV control efforts. Since 1995 efforts have been made to improve policy decisions. Two major strategic plans were issued in 1998 and 2001, with increased government funding for implementation. Although the challenges facing HIV/AIDs control in China are many, the Chinese government is making a stronger commitment for implementing effective AIDS control measures in the country.

We investigate the global attractivity of infection-free periodic solution and the persistence of the disease. Furthermore, two thresholds which govern the extinction and the persistence of the epidemic disease are derived. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical findings and the effects of control measures.

TI The AIDS epidemic and economic input impact factors in Chongqing, China,
   from 2006 to 2012: a spatial-temporal analysis
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Objective: To analyse the spatial-temporal clustering of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Chongqing and to explore its association with the economic indices of AIDS prevention and treatment.
   Methods: Data on the HIV/AIDS epidemic and economic indices of AIDS prevention and treatment were obtained from the annual reports of the Chongqing Municipal Center for Disease Control for 2006-2012. Spatial clustering analysis, temporal-spatial clustering analysis, and spatial regression were used to conduct statistical analysis.
   Results: The annual average new HIV infection rate, incidence rate for new AIDS cases, and rate of people living with HIV in Chongqing were 5.97, 2.42 and 28.12 per 100 000, respectively, for 2006-2012. The HIV/AIDS epidemic showed a non-random spatial distribution (Moran's I >= 0.310; p<0.05). The epidemic hotspots were distributed in the 15 mid-western counties. The most likely clusters were primarily located in the central region and southwest of Chongqing and occurred in 2010-2012. The regression coefficients of the total amount of special funds allocated to AIDS and to the public awareness unit for the numbers of new HIV cases, new AIDS cases, and people living with HIV were 0.775, 0.976 and 0.816, and -0.188, -0.259 and -0.215 (p<0.002), respectively.
   Conclusions: The Chongqing HIV/AIDS epidemic showed temporal-spatial clustering and was mainly clustered in the mid-western and south-western counties, showing an upward trend over time. The amount of special funds dedicated to AIDS and to the public awareness unit showed positive and negative relationships with HIV/AIDS spatial clustering, respectively.

AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic is increasingly regarded as a socioeconomic problem. Among factors causing poverty, cultural aspects, including religion and traditions, appear to play an essential role in the rapid and global development of AIDS epidemic. AIDS is a pathologic syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Scientific knowledge is required to prevent and treat AIDS. Although considerable progress has been made in antiretroviral therapy, neither actual cure of HIV infection, nor an efficient protection method, nor a vaccine are currently globally accessible. Consequently, the funding of scientific research is of utmost importance. On the basis of recent scientific findings, new perspectives for global protection and gender equity against HIV transmission are emerging. Progress is being made in developing microbicides or virucides, anti-infective medication formulated for topical self-administration, to protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted pathogens. Such developments need to be supported by extensive education campaigns geared to women to give them the possibility of protecting themselves and their children from HIV transmission. The level of funding for microbicide and vaccine development needs to be greatly increased. New possibilities have emerged for an efficient vaccine which would engage the mucosal immune system, first involved in the sexual transmission of HIV-1. The idea of vaccine production in edible tissues of transgenic crop plants has also gained momentum. The use of minimally processed, low-cost, orally delivered immunogens is especially valuable when raising mucosal antibodies is the object and when frequent boosting is anticipated, as is the case for mucosal immunity.

AB Threat of co-epidemic HIV-111 is a major problem that must be faced by countries around the world. In 2011, approximately about one-third of the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide is infected with latent TB. Persons co-infected with TB and HIV are 21-34 times more likely to develop active TB disease than persons without HIV. In this paper, we develop a simple co-epidemic model of HIV-TB. We calculate the basic reproduction ratio at the disease-free equilibrium, and the quasidisease-free equilibrium, which we define as the existence of one disease along with the complete eradication of the other disease, and the co-infection equilibrium for specific conditions. Using this model, we study co-epidemic HIV-TB in Indonesia based on demography data in 2009 to explore the effects of hypothetical prevention and treatment scenarios. Our simple model of coepidemic HIV-TB describes the importance of including the effects of HIV on 113 and vice versa on the transmission and progression of the HIV and TB epidemic.

TI Risk-taking propensity changes throughout the course of residential
   substance abuse treatment
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB High rates of relapse following treatment have compelled researchers to elucidate the individual difference factors that change among those who receive substance abuse treatment. Previous research has suggested that trait-disinhibition variables may be of particular relevance. Given that these variables are primarily considered to be trait-level factors, the extent to which they are malleable by treatment is an important consideration. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a residential substance abuse treatment program on specific trait-disinhibition variables (e.g., risk-taking and impulsivity). A sample of 81 inner-city substance users was assessed on self-report and behavioral indicators of trait-disinhibition over a 30-day course of treatment. Risk-taking propensity was found to significantly decrease from pre- to post-treatment. Results are discussed with respect to implications for better understanding the factors that may operate as mechanisms of change during treatment, thereby having the potential to inform substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.

TI The HIV epidemic and the state of its surveillance in Ethiopia
SO ETHIOPIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB A review of the information on the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia is important to guide policy and action. Published and unpublished reports and surveillance data from records of governmental and non-governmental institutions were examined to assess the extent of the epidemic. It appears that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has affected a large segment of the urban population. Surveillance data from pregnant women attending antenatal clinics indicate a decreasing trend in the prevalence of HIV in Addis Ababa. Similarly, data from blood donors from the majority of transfusion centres in the country indicate a decrease in prevalence. However, further studies will be required to establish the validity of these findings. Currently available data are not adequate to accurately measure the level of infection in rural areas where 85% of the population live. Outside of Addis Ababa, in places where ANC-based sentinel surveillance are operational, the systems are not fully supported by quality cont;ol. Thus, there are concerns regarding the validity of reported results. The impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ethiopia needs to be further quantified both in its burden of diseases and ifs impact on the urban and rural economy and society. It is, therefore, important that effort and adequate. resources are put into strengthening surveillance systems.

TI How much does heterosexual commercial sex contribute to India's HIV
   epidemic?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
AB Through a search, we identified five models of India's HIV epidemic, all of which articulate the hypothesis that heterosexual commercial sex drives India's HIV epidemic. All five models assume more female sex workers (FSWs) than have been mapped (counted), and more than can be inferred from men's sexual behaviour. With best and highest plausible evidence-based estimates (15-20% of 300,000-700,000 FSWs are HIV-positive; FSWs have 570 client contacts per year; clients use condoms with 60-75% of FSW contacts; and the rate of HIV transmission from FSWs to clients is 0.0011-0.002 per unprotected contact), FSWs and clients account for 2-15% of HIV-infected adults, far less than model-based estimates of 44-68%. Overestimating the contribution of commercial sex to India's HIV epidemic misleads prevention programmes to ignore other risks, and promotes the stigmatizing assumption that HIV infection is a sign of immoral behaviour.

TI Incorporating a public health approach in drug law: Lessons from local
   expansion of treatment capacity and access under California's
   Proposition 36
SO MILBANK QUARTERLY
AB A major state drug abuse initiative, California's Proposition 36 of 2000, mandated that adults convicted of drug possession be offered treatment in lieu of incarceration. While the law expanded public treatment for arrestees, the counties were given discretion in structuring their systems of care and procedures to manage clients. Using data from a study of key informants in eight counties, this article examines local planning to increase drug treatment capacity and manage clients' access to treatment. In both these planning domains, it describes the counties' strategies and concerns, reasons for their differences in approaches, and whether and how this state initiative, which explicitly incorporated treatment objectives into penal drug law, will shift the debate over drug abuse policy toward greater consideration of public health goals.

SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB To assess effects of risk factors on the HIV epidemic by heterosexual transmission and the role of prostitutes, in this paper we consider four populations and derive the probabilities of HIV infection in these populations. The four populations considered are the single males, the single females, the married couples, and the prostitutes. It is shown that prostitutes form a stepping stone for the HIV epidemic by heterosexual transmission. Thus, in a society in which homosexual transmission and IV drug use are not frequent, the HIV epidemic can hardly be maintained without prostitutes.

TI A Systemic Inquiry into the AIDS Epidemic in the Western Cape of South
   Africa through Interactive Management
SO SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
AB South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 6.2 million South Africans are living with HIV/AIDS. The AIDS epidemic has impacted on its economy and plagued its vibrancy. The government of South Africa has invested significant resources to fight AIDS. However, the number of AIDS-related deaths in South Africa is the second highest in the world. Different from the common approaches used to study the AIDS problem, this paper demonstrates how Interactive Management (IM), a methodology echoing systemic thinking, can be employed to identify the drivers leading to the AIDS epidemic in the Western Cape of South Africa. The preliminary exploration is not aimed at discovering a theory, but enhancing learning and consensus among stakeholders. Through a full-day IM session, the study identified two major drivers leading to the AIDS epidemic: poverty and lack of knowledge of HIV/AIDS. The identified drivers can serve as a starting point to revisit the current governmental strategies in fighting AIDS.

AB In the United States, the AIDS epidemic is a dynamic process with increasing rates of AIDS reported among women, minority populations, heterosexual men, and users of drugs by routes other than injection. The 1993 CDC AIDS definition change has created some difficulties in interpreting trends in the United States. Drug use continues to represent a significant problem among HIV-infected persons. Several strategies have been advanced to decrease transmission of HIV among drug, users, their sexual partners and children. However, more effective and comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies are needed.

TI Update and projection on HIV/AIDS in Taiwan
SO AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Taiwan started in 1986, with 5,221 cases of HIV infections, 1,596 cases of AIDS, and 911 deaths reported through 2003. National surveillance data indicate that men who have sex with men accounted for 48.2% of HIV infections, followed by heterosexual men (33.8%) and heterosexual women (6.1%). Only 353 (6.8%) of all HIV cases are females. The average age of HIV-infected persons, AIDS cases, and deaths was 31.2, 36.2, and 39.0 years, respectively. The incidence of HIV infection has increased by approximately 15% every year since 1997. The continuing epidemic will likely burden the national health care system and may result in an estimated socioeconomic loss of U.S.$1.6 billion in 2010, as 15,125 HIV infections and 1,420 deaths from AIDS are projected. To respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Taiwan, the government has been working with nongovernmental organizations to promote HIV testing, conduct various education programs, and reach out to high-risk groups. HIV/AIDS patients are linked to medical care and provided with free highly active antiretroviral treatment. The main challenge is to reduce HIV-related stigma. Prevention focused on preventing further transmission of HIV by seropositive persons to others is urgently needed in fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI Alcohol and Cannabis Use and Sexual Risk Behaviors in the Malawi Defence
   Force
SO AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB Substance abuse is a public health priority in the context of the HIV epidemic, especially in military communities. This cross-sectional study quantified alcohol and cannabis use in the Malawi Defence Force and investigated its associations with condom use, transactional sex, multiple sexual partners, and sexual violence. Participants were 944 male and female service members >= 18 years old. Data were collected in 2013 using a computer-assisted self-interview. Twenty-four percent of men and women screened positive for hazardous and harmful drinking [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score >= 8]. About 6% reported using cannabis in the past year and 10% reported using cannabis prior to 1 year ago. Multivariable models found elevated adjusted odds of transactional sex and multiple sexual partners for men with an AUDIT score >= 8, and men who reported ever using cannabis. The adjusted odds of experiencing sexual violence were also elevated for men who reported ever using cannabis. These findings add to the growing concern that substance use may perpetuate the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa by increasing risky sexual behaviors. A comprehensive military HIV prevention response should include substance use education and appropriate care and treatment for individuals screening positive for hazardous and harmful drinking.

TI From the ABC model to the A-REFLEX model: a triple psychodynamic,
   positive psychology, and eudaimonic ethos in the fight against the AIDS
   epidemic in Africa
SO HIV & AIDS REVIEW
AB This article aims to critically explore psychodynamic principles for managing the AIDS epidemic. The methodology is qualitative theoretical analyses, articulated around the ABC model, which is an abstinence- based sex education policy, and Freudian psychodynamic theory. The latter constitute double paradigmatic lenses for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency in managing the spread of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. The paper posits that the ABC model has been effective in this fight, but proposes that if psychodynamic principles are associated with the former, there are greater chances that the fight against the AIDS epidemic will receive a greater psychological boost. In other words, without "individual psychological transformation", the ABC model would remain limited in its effectiveness, because it does not directly address the issue of transformation of the "death instinct or Thanatos" into "life force or Eros". The paper thus advocates that in addition to "A" or "abstinence", there could be "Self-Sacrificing Sublimation" or Authentic Redirection of libidinal energy into Creative Life Force; "B" or "Be Faithful to your sexual partner(s)" can be reinforced by "Flow" for reinforcing Transpersonality; "C" or " use a condom" could be complemented by " Creative Self-Expressing Eudaimonism". This paper thus proposes a new model, A-REFLEX, which could be used complementarily with the ABC model in the fight against the AIDS epidemic in Africa.

SO SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Substance abuse is a leading cause of death and disability throughout the world. The mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is to lead the United States in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. This charge has two critical components: (a) strategic support of research across a broad range of disciplines and (b) rapid, effective dissemination of research results that can improve prevention and treatment efforts, with potential to inform policy. The NIDA Clinical Trials Network and the Blending Initiative are critical elements of this strategy, and the social work field is poised to use these resources to expand its role in the dissemination and implementation of NIDA's mission.

TI Causes and rates of death among methadone maintenance patients before
   and after the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
SO MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB Causes of death and the mortality rates of active methadone patients and those who had left treatment were compared. Prior to the HIV epidemic, death rates among discharged methadone patients were more than twice that of patients who continued with their methadone treatment. However, the death rate from heroin-related causes in the post-treatment period was 51 times the rate among active patients. Alcohol-related conditions were the leading causes of death in patients more than 30 years old on methadone. During the post-treatment period, alcohol-related deaths were second to those of heroin-related causes. Alcohol-related deaths were particularly pronounced among black patients. Death rates among active male and female patients were identical, but the death rate for discharged female patients was greater than for discharged males
   With the onset of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s, AIDS-related causes became the major cause of death in treatment. However, other causes of death, such as alcohol and other medical conditions, identified prior to the AIDS epidemic, persisted. AIDS-related deaths peaked in the mid-1990s and have recently subsided. However, within the past two years, deaths related to HCV have increased to 9% of all patient deaths in a major methadone program. With the emergence of HCV, deaths from this cause are expected to eclipse AIDS-related deaths within the next decade.

With current available technology and knowledge SPECT has the potential to add important clinical information to benefit patient care in many different areas of a substance abuse practice. This article explores the clinical controversies and limitations of brain SPECT, plus seven ways it has the potential to be immediately useful in clinical substance abuse practice, including: adding valuable information to the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of substance abusers; helping clinicians ask better questions; helping them in making more complete diagnoses and preventing mistakes; evaluating underlying brain system pathology in individual patients; decreasing stigma and increasing compliance; visualizing effectiveness via follow-up evaluations; and encouraging the exploration of innovative and alternative treatments

TI Employing continuous quality improvement in community-based substance
   abuse programs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE
AB Purpose - This article aims to describe continuous quality improvement (CQI) for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs in a community- based organization setting.
   Design/methodology/approach - CQI (e. g., plan-do-study-act cycles (PDSA)) applied in healthcare and industry was adapted for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs in a community setting. The authors assessed the resources needed, acceptability and CQI feasibility for ten programs by evaluating CQI training workshops with program staff and a series of three qualitative interviews over a nine- month implementation period with program participants. The CQI activities, PDSA cycle progress, effort, enthusiasm, benefits and challenges were examined.
   Findings - Results indicated that CQI was feasible and acceptable for community-based substance abuse prevention and treatment programs; however, some notable resource challenges remain. Future studies should examine CQI impact on service quality and intended program outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted on a small number of programs. It did not assess CQI impact on service quality and intended program outcomes.
   Practical implications - This project shows that it is feasible to adapt CQI techniques and processes for community-based programs substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. These techniques may help community-based program managers to improve service quality and achieve program outcomes.
   Originality/ value - This is one of the first studies to adapt traditional CQI techniques for community-based settings delivering substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.

TI Epidemiology of drug abuse treatment in South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB Background. The aim of the study was to explore the epidemiology of drug abuse treatment in South Africa.
   Methods. Treatment demand statistics were analysed from South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use records, and a rapid situation assessment was conducted. Twenty-one key informant interviews were conducted in all 9 provinces among provincial substance abuse co-ordinators, and one manager per treatment centre from a sample of treatment centres. Three focus groups were conducted and 46 self-administered questionnaires were distributed among inpatients at 2 selected treatment centres in Free State and North West provinces. Qualitative data were analysed using grounded theory, and quantitative data analysed using SPSS.
   Results. Treatment records show that the most frequent substance of abuse was alcohol (51%), followed by cannabis (21%), crack/cocaine (9.6%), heroin/opiates (7.9%), methamphetamine (Tik) (4.5%), prescription/over-the-counter drugs (2.0%), and cannabis/mandrax (1.7%). More substance abusers were male, of lower education, white or black, than were female, more highly educated, coloured and Indian/Asian. Key informant interviews showed that females are the 'hidden' substance abusers and tend not to be identified in research statistics and at treatment centres. Poverty, unemployment, lack of recreational facilities, being surrounded by substance abusers, and long work shifts were also mentioned as factors contributing to substance abuse. The age of initiation of substance abuse using non-drugs such as glue was 9 years old, alcohol 10 - 12 years old, dagga 11 - 12 years old, poly-drug use (alcohol, tobacco and dagga) 14 years old, and harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin at 16 - 17 years old, as reported by key informants. Family care and support, improved socio-economic conditions and increased law enforcement would help to discourage substance abuse.
   Conclusion. Prevention interventions and policies in South Africa should focus on reducing substance abuse by targeting the 'at risk populations' identified in this study.

TI Emergence of the HIV type 1 epidemic in the twentieth century: Comparing
   hypotheses to evidence
SO AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES
AB The existence of multiple groups of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 suggests that zoonotic transmissions of SIV have occurred at a low rate for centuries. Hence, an increase in the rate of human- to- human transmission may be necessary and sufficient to explain the emergence of HIV as an epidemic in the twentieth century. Three common hypotheses to explain accelerated transmission are ( 1) social changes accelerated sexual transmission, ( 2) health care changes accelerated parenteral transmission, and ( 3) serial passaging adapted HIV for persistent infection and sexual transmission. These hypotheses can be compared to a range of evidence. Temporal and geographic discontinuities in HIV epidemic growth are not easily explained by supposed increases in sexual transmission over time. Large historic changes in sexual transmission are hard to explain based on weak evidence associating HIV prevalence in African communities with differences in sexual behavior. On the other hand, documented iatrogenic outbreaks show high rates of parenteral transmission. The distribution of hepatitis C virus infections and the history of multiinjection treatment for trypanosomiasis in Central Africa suggest widespread parenteral transmission of blood- borne viruses during 1920 - 1940, coinciding in time and place with the early HIV epidemic. This suggests an important role for parenteral transmission in the early spread of HIV. Further research could improve our understanding of the early HIV epidemic.

   AT RISK FOR AIDS
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB Less is known about the effects of primary relationships on psychological health for homosexual men and women than for heterosexual men and women. Given the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the primary relationships of homosexual men are especially important to examine at the present time. Using questionnaire data collected from 259 homosexual men, this study examined the effects of status and quality of relationship on psychological health. Analysis indicated that homosexual men who are in primary relationships experience fewer depressive symptoms and greater well-being than other homosexual men but that being in a relationship does not predict changes in these outcomes over time. Men who report high quality of relationship show improvements over time in psychological health. These findings are discussed in fight of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

TI AIDS and declining support for dependent elderly people in Africa:
   retrospective analysis using demographic and health surveys
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objectives To determine the relation between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and support for dependent elderly people in Africa.
   Design Retrospective analysis using data from Demographic and Health Surveys.
   Setting 22 African countries between 1991 and 2006.
   Participants 123 176 individuals over the age of 60.
   Main outcome measures We investigated how three measures of the living arrangements of older people have been affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic: the number of older individuals living alone (that is, the number of unattended elderly people); the number of older individuals living with only dependent children under the age of 10 (that is, in missing generation households); and the number of adults age 18-59 (that is, prime age adults) per household where an older person lives.
   Results An increase in annual AIDS mortality of one death per 1000 people was associated with a 1.5% increase in the proportion of older individuals living alone (95% CI 1.2% to 1.9%) and a 0.4% increase in the number of older individuals living in missing generation households (95% CI 0.3% to 0.6%). Increases in AIDS mortality were also associated with fewer prime age adults in households with at least one older person and at least one prime age adult (P<0.001). These findings suggest that in our study countries, which encompass 70% of the sub-Saharan population, the HIV/AIDS epidemic could be responsible for 582 200-917 000 older individuals living alone without prime age adults and 141 000-323 100 older individuals being the sole caregivers for young children.
   Conclusions Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic might be responsible for a large number of older people losing their support and having to care for young children. This population has previously been under-recognised. Efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS deaths could have large "spillover" benefits for elderly people in Africa.

TI REFLECTIONS ON THE EARLY HISTORY OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE
   (NIDA): IMPLICATIONS FOR TODAY
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was formed in September, 1973 from a Division of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), from the three-decade old Addiction Research Center (ARC) in Lexington Kentucky, and from the two year old Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP), the original White House drug office. The legislation authorizing NIDA was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the president with bipartisan unanimity in response to the drug abuse epidemic, which had begun in the late 1960s. NIDA was the embodiment of the new Federal drug abuse strategy that, for the first time, balanced the traditional focus on law enforcement (supply reduction) with a new focus on treatment, prevention, and research (what became known as demand reduction). The current article offers a review of the early history of NIDA and its implications for future research.

TI A pilot study of reunification following drug abuse treatment:
   Recovering the mother role
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB This qualitative study explored the experiences of women in recovery from drug abuse who had resumed parenting their children after child placement. Six mothers and I I service providers from substance abuse treatment and child welfare agencies were interviewed about their perceptions of the experience of being reunified with one's children following substance abuse treatment Findings revealed that mothers have intense emotional reactions to having children placed, which can motivate recovery but also be a source of stress. A variety of supports were identified as necessary to prepare mothers for resuming care of children beyond substance abuse treatment including counseling, child care, financial support, and parenting education. Reunification, however desirable, was described as overwhelming and fraught with parenting challenges, such as effective limit setting with children. Numerous challenges and barriers to successful reunification were identified, such as stigmatization in the child welfare system. Implications for service delivery and research are discussed.

TI Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for Older Adults: An Enhanced
   Therapeutic Community Model
SO JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL SOCIAL WORK
AB A review of the epidemiology of substance abuse and corollary treatment capabilities for older adults is summarized. This review demonstrates that there is a growing number of older adults with substance abuse problems, and that a majority of such adults are under-diagnosed and have little access to treatment.
   Research at Odyssey House, a non-profit, substance abuse and mental health treatment agency based in New York City, where older adults have been treated since 1997 within a discrete residential unit, is reviewed. Findings identify two distinct subgroups among the older adults being treated at Odyssey House: lifelong users (become dependent on drugs during adolescence) and late-in-life users (become dependent on drugs after age 45). Treatment implications are discussed in terms of the provision of special groups, such as trauma and bereavement groups for late-in-life users; and poly-substance abuse and relapse prevention groups for the lifelong users.
   The Enhanced Therapeutic Community is presented as the primary social group and treatment modality for the effective care of older adults with chemical dependence problems. The community intervention is based on the values and principles of mutual aid and self-help for individuals who are willing and able to share their common experiences while supporting and comforting each other. The Enhanced Therapeutic Community is consistent and contemporary with our social work values and methods of social work with groups today, and is an effective method for the treatment of older adults with substance abuse problems. Two case study vignettes, which mirror the research and group process, are presented. (C) 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A STOCHASTIC-MODEL OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC INVOLVING BOTH SEXUAL CONTACT AND
   IV DRUG-USE
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
AB In this paper we develop a stochastic model for the HIV epidemic involving both sexual contact and IV drug use by taking into account the dynamic of the HIV epidemic. The model is formulated in terms of the chain multi-nomial model which provides a mechanism by means of which one may derive the moments of the numbers of S people, L people, I people and A people. By using the model we show by Monte Carlo studies that the randomness of the number of different partners per unit time seem to have little effects on the HIV epidemic if the expected number of different partners per unit time is not very small (say greater-than-or-equal-to 0.5). However, the numerical results indicate clearly that in almost all the cases the results of the deterministic model provide poor approximation to the corresponding expected numbers of the stochastic model.

TI Antiretroviral therapy initiated soon after HIV diagnosis as standard
   care: potential to save lives?
SO HIV AIDS-RESEARCH AND PALLIATIVE CARE
AB In 2008, an estimated 33.4 million people were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and similar to 4 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, in 2007, an estimated 6.7 million people were in need of ART under the current World Health Organization guidelines, and 2.7 million more people became infected with HIV. Most of those not currently eligible for ART will become eligible within the next decade, making the current treatment strategy unsustainable. The development of cheaper, less toxic, and more potent antiretrovirals over the past decade has made it possible to consider novel strategies of arresting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Evidence is growing that ART can be used to prevent HIV transmission and that earlier initiation of treatment is beneficial for those infected with HIV. A mathematical model predicts that by testing whole communities annually and treating all who are infected immediately, up to 7.2 million AIDS-related deaths could be prevented in the next 40 years, long-term funding required to fight the HIV epidemic could be reduced, and, most importantly, control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic could be regained within 1-2 years of full-scale implementation of the strategy. We discuss the development of the concept of ART for the prevention of HIV transmission and the modeled impact that a test-and-treat strategy could have on the HIV epidemic, and consequently argue that a field trial should be carried out to confirm model parameters, highlight any practical problems, and test the model's predictions.

   self-esteem among adolescents in substance abuse prevention
SO ENFERMERIA CLINICA
AB Objective: Substance abuse is one of the most serious problems in Indonesia and is highly prevalent among adolescents. Therefore, psychotherapy is needed in preventing substance abuse for adolescents. This study aims to analyze the influence of coping skills training and family health education on self-esteem in a sample of 87 young people.
   Method: The sample was divided into two groups using simple random sampling. ANOVA was used to determine differences between the control group and those receiving coping skills training and family health education.
   Results: Self-esteem improved significantly in the group that received the experimental training (F(1.85) =44.70, p< 0.001). Some practical implications can be deduced for psychiatric nurses to implemented coping skill training and family health education as a standard treatment in substance abuse prevention among adolescents.

AB This study examined fidelity in multidimensional family prevention (MDFP), a family-based prevention counseling model for adolescents at high risk for substance abuse and related behavior problems, in comparison to two empirically based treatments for adolescent drug abuse: multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Randomly selected videotapes of 109 MDFP sessions, 57 MD.FT sessions, and 31 CBT sessions were observationally rated along two key dimensions of implementation: intervention parameters and intervention techniques. Overall, MDFP was similar to MD.FT and different from CBT in a manner congruent with its theoretical principles of interactional, systemic intervention. However, deficiencies in parental monitoring and developmental knowledge interventions point the way for continued model development. The utility of fidelity process research for conveying intervention technology along the prevention-treatment continuum Of mental health services is discussed. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Accelerating harm reduction interventions to confront the HIV epidemic
   in the Western Pacific and Asia: the role of WHO (WPRO)
SO HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL
AB The epidemic of HIV/AIDS linked to injecting drug usage is one of the most explosive in recent years. After a historical epicentre in Europe, South and North America, at present it is clearly the main cause of dissemination of the epidemic in Eastern Europe and some key Asian countries. Recently, 10 African countries reported the spread of HIV through people who inject drugs (PWID), breaking one of the final geographical barriers to the globalization of the epidemic of HIV among and from PWID.
   Several countries of the Asia and Pacific Region have HIV epidemics that are driven by injecting drug usage. Harm reduction interventions have been implemented in many countries and potential barriers to implementation are being overcome. Harm reduction is no longer a marginal approach in the Region; instead, it is the core tool for responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic among PWID. The development of a comprehensive response in the Region has been remarkable, including scaling up of needle and syringe programmes (NSPs), methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), and care, support and treatment for PWID. This development is being followed up by strong ongoing changes in policies and legislations. The main issue now is to enhance interventions to a level that can impact the epidemic.
   The World Health Organization (WHO) is one of the leading UN agencies promoting harm reduction. Since the establishment of the Global Programme on AIDS, WHO has been working towards an effective response to the HIV epidemic among PWID. WHO's work is organized into a number of components: establishing an evidence base; advocacy; development of normative standards, tools and guidelines; providing technical support to countries; ensuring access to essential medicines, diagnostics and commodities; and mobilizing resources.
   In this paper, we trace the course of development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among and from PWID in the Western Pacific and Asia Region (WPRO) as well as WHO's role in supporting the response in some of the key countries: Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines and Viet Nam.

SO ALCOHOL
AB Physicians can play an increased role in recognizing, intervening, and moderating their patients' misuse of alcohol and other drugs. This article explores the need for educational changes to permit physicians to develop skills in prevention, screening, and office-based treatment. It includes a personal account by one of the authors of his expereience in recognizing deficiencies in substance abuse education both in his own medical school training and in today's health science curricula in the United States, It reviews prior initiatitives by NIAAA/NIDA to address curriculum needs and describes an innovative collaborative model in North Carolina called the Governor's Institute on Alcohol and Substance Abuse. The Institute was created in 1990 as a nonprofit corporation to promote education, research, and communication among health professionals. Some of the Institute's programs are described, including its curriculum integration project in the state's four medical schools. The article concludes that the time is right to introduce substance abuse concepts into basic and continuing education for all health professsionals.
