TI Queen's Gambit Declined: The Gender-Equality Paradox in Chess
   Participation Across 160 Countries
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB The gender-equality paradox refers to the puzzling finding that societies with more gender equality demonstrate larger gender differences across a range of phenomena, most notably in the proportion of women who pursue degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math. The present investigation demonstrates across two different measures of gender equality that this paradox extends to chess participation (N = 803,485 across 160 countries; age range: 3-100 years), specifically that women participate more often in countries with less gender equality. Previous explanations for the paradox fail to account for this finding. Instead, consistent with the notion that gender equality reflects a generational shift, mediation analyses suggest that the gender-equality paradox in chess is driven by the greater participation of younger players in countries with less gender equality. A curvilinear effect of gender equality on the participation of female players was also found, demonstrating that gender differences in chess participation are largest at the highest and lowest ends of the gender-equality spectrum.

TI The impact of education level and economic freedom on gender inequality:
   panel evidence from emerging markets
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Gender equality is a critical factor for all ingredients of a healthy society and sustainable development. Therefore, measures to decrease gender inequalities in economic, social, and political life are important for the economic and social development of a society. This study analyzes the influence of education level and economic freedom on gender inequality in emerging markets over the 2000-2020 term through causality and cointegration tests. The results of the causality test uncover a bidirectional causality between education level, economic freedom, and gender inequality. In other words, there exists a mutual interaction among education level, economic freedom, and gender inequality in the short term. Furthermore, the findings of cointegration analysis indicate that education level and economic freedom have a negative impact on gender inequality in the long term, but education level is much more effective on gender inequality than economic freedom in nearly all emerging markets.

TI GENDER INEQUALITY AND CONVERGENCE IN THE EU-28 COUNTRIES (2005-2015)
SO REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL
AB Gender equality benefits the whole society. This paper compares the situation of the countries of the European Union in terms of gender equality, and analyzes whether the countries with greater inequalities (the orientals) have managed to reduce the gap with the most advanced (the nordics) in the period 2005-2015. We examined sigma-convergence and beta-convergence using panel data from the Gender Equality Index for the 28 countries of the Union. The results show a certain approach in terms of gender equality. This convergence is conditioned by the educational differences between the countries.

TI Gender equality, norms and practices: Post-script to special issue on
   new actors, old donors and gender equality norms in international
   development cooperation
SO PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The contributions raise several important issues regarding the norm of gender equality in development organizations, and I want to raise the following points for further consideration. Does it matter if we treat gender equality as a norm or practice? The articles suggest that there is general movement toward the norm, but what it means to do gender equality is quite fractured. Who decides what gender equality means? Why do organizations feel the need to adopt this norm? Organizations have different motives, and these motives are probably important for understanding whether these norms have any impact. Impact refers to effects, and there are various kinds of effects raised by the articles, though focused mainly on the norm's institutionalization rather than its impact.

TI A Scandinavian model? Gender equality discourses on multiculturalism
SO SOCIAL POLITICS
AB Along with the other Nordic countries, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway are often perceived of as gender equality pioneers with comprehensive gender equality policies. But how does the governmental gender equality policy of today reflect that their populations have become more culturally diverse during the last decades? My analysis, based partly on governmental action plans for gender equality 2000-2005, including the related parliamentary debates, points to some similarities but also to major intercountry differences. In all three countries, there is expressed a clear concern for the agency of women and girls of ethnic minority background, centered on violence and oppression. But, while ethnic minority and gender equality is highly prioritized in the Danish gender equality policy, the same is not true for the Swedish equivalent in the period studied. Also, the Danish case gives the clearest example of what is believed to be conflict between minority cultural traditions and "Danish" equality norms, whereas the Swedish governmental rhetoric is dominated by theories of ongoing patriarchy, seemingly indifferent to cultural diversity. While Norway is characterized by a lack of overall gender equality action plans and parliamentary gender equality debates during this period, its policies towards gender and multiculturalism have been managed largely as discrete issues.

TI Examining the promise of 'the local' for improving gender equality in
   agriculture and climate change adaptation
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Building on the conceptualisation of 'the local' in gender and development discourse, we explore how national and sub-national policy actors in Uganda perceive gender equality policy in the context of agriculture and climate change, to assess the potential of localised solutions to achieve gender equality. Using data from national and sub-national policy actors in Uganda (37 semi-structured interviews, 78 questionnaires), the study found that policy actors largely adhered to global gender discourses in proposing context-specific solutions to gender inequality. Our results show that although local actors identified local norms and culture as major barriers to gender equality, their proposed solutions did not address local gender norms, focussed on formal policy and did little to address underlying causes of gender inequalities. Based on the findings, we suggest that 'the local' should be reconstructed as a deliberative space where a wide variety of actors, including local feminist organisations, critically engage, assess and address local gender inequality patterns in agriculture and climate change adaptation processes.

TI The relationship between gender equality and democracy: A comparison of
   Arab versus non-Arab Muslim societies
SO SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Inglehart and Norris argue that the core clash between the Islamic world and the West is over issues concerning gender equality rather than democracy. However, a comparison between Arab and non-Arab Muslim societies is essential before drawing this conclusion. Here, we compared nations from each society and found significant differences in attitudes toward gender equality, democratic governance and religious identities. We analyzed models predicting support for democracy including views toward gender equality in each set of countries. In non-Arab Muslim countries, there were higher levels of support for women's rights, and those who supported gender equality were significantly more likely to support democracy. The reverse was true in the Arab Muslim countries. We argue that for a complete and unbiased form of democracy to emerge in the Arab Middle East, a rule of law that would protect gender equality, minority rights and citizen inclusion would need to be instituted.

TI How to Study Gender Equality Policy Cross-Nationally? Aggregate or
   Disaggregate Gender Equality Policy Indices?
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper discusses the approaches to study gender equality policies and presents a scheme of best ways to study gender equality policies. Looking to the literature, there are three main approaches to study gender equality policies. First of all, there are studies which focus on one, two or small numbers of issues of gender equality policies such as abortion policies, domestic violence policies or day care policies and examine the country dynamics either in single case studies or large and small-N comparative studies. Secondly, sectoral approach to study gender equality assumes that gender equality policy is a separate sector of government policies which includes various subsectors such as representation policies or reproduction policies. Lastly, international organizations such as the United Nations applied aggregation strategy by combining different indicators of gender equality policies into an index. These kinds of indexes are widely used by scholars with the aim of comparing countries' responsiveness to gender equality. This study questions strengths and weaknesses of each approach and proposes a scheme to determine the best use for each approach. In doing that this paper also presents new and original scales to study different dimensions of gender equality and includes an empirical analysis of gender equality policy indicators for 84 countries' responsiveness to gender equality.

TI 'Are we there yet?' Citizens of Serbia and public policy on gender
   equality within the EU accession context
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB This article explores three dimensions of the current state of gender equality in Serbia: public policy on gender equality, public opinion on gender equality and the context of Serbia's accession to the EU. Using data from the recent (2010) public opinion survey of citizens' attitudes towards gender equality, the authors address the following issues: (1) harmonization of public policy on gender equality in Serbia with EU policies; (2) differences between public policy on gender equality in Serbia and citizens' preferences; (3) convergences/divergences between citizens of Serbia and EU citizens regarding gender equality. As Serbia's policy of promoting gender equality in the last decade has been dominated by the political goal of accession to the EU, it shows where the opinions converge (violence against women is seen as a priority), and where there are certain differences (intervention in gender equality issues). The authors show the complexity of ideological positions among average Serbian citizens, while highlighting different (and sometimes contradictory) paradigms in the official public policy on gender equality. While Serbian citizens still do not place gender equality high on their political agenda, they are convinced that it has a certain value, which does provide some important pointers for the future.

TI Quantifying for Qualifying: A Framework for Assessing Gender Equality in
   Higher Education Institutions
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The objective of this study is to present the development of a framework for assessing gender inequality in higher education institutions (HEIs) which reveals how this academic environment is progressing in terms of gender balance. It proposes a multi-dimension-based index comprised by five dimensions-Empowerment, Education, Health, Violence, and Time. The mathematical model used enables the user to assign a weight value to each dimension, customizing the results according to the institution addressed. The paper is based on a post-doctoral research project which analyzed six globally recognized indexes (Gender Inequality Index; Global Gender Gap Index; Women, Business, and Law Index; Gender Equality Index; Social Institutions Global Index; Women Empowerment Principles) to construct a new framework for gender inequality evaluation tailored for HEIs. It used a Laplace-Gauss-based scale. The research included an experiment of concrete application to two instiutions, one in Europe and the other in South America. While the first one had a Gender Equality Plan, the second had not. The analysis was successfully conducted in both institutions. The two institutions presented general results above 60%. These results need to be read in the specific context of each university. The Gender Equality in Higher Education Institutions Index (GEHEI) provides a user-friendly way of checking the existence of gender inequality, summarized into a single number but able to be detailed in several levels and to provide insight into progression over time. The handling of the GEHEI tool is also very straightforward. The proposal is designed to be used in different HEIs; it is recommended that researchers customize the weights of the dimensions according to their relevance in the specific organization. This paper provides a new methodological model to measure gender inequality in HEIs based on easy-to-obtain data, distinguishing itself from global indexes by its ease of application and interpretation.

AB Gender has a powerful influence on experiences of, and resilience to, climate change. In this Review, the authors provide an overview of four common gender assumptions, and offer four suggestions for a more informed pursuit of gender equality in climate change policy and practice.
   Gender has a powerful influence on people's experience of, and resilience to, climate change. Global climate change policy is committed to tackling gender inequalities in mitigation and adaptation. However, progress is hindered by numerous challenges, including an enduring set of gender assumptions: women are caring and connected to the environment, women are a homogenous and vulnerable group, gender equality is a women's issue and gender equality is a numbers game. We provide an overview of how these assumptions essentialize women's and men's characteristics, narrowly diagnose the causes of gender inequality, and thereby propel strategies that have unintended and even counterproductive consequences. We offer four suggestions for a more informed pursuit of gender equality in climate change policy and practice.

AB The study investigated undergraduate students' perceptions of gender equality, their practices and perceived strategies to promote gender equality in Afghanistan. It also examined the impact of the participants' gender on their responses. The authors used an online questionnaire to collect data from 448 students using snowball sampling technique. They used descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data. The findings showed that the majority of the participants had favorable perceptions about gender equality, and an overwhelming majority disagreed with the traditional notion of "women belong in the kitchen and men belong at the office". They used various practices to varying extent to promote gender equality in their communities (e.g. advocacy for gender equality). They suggested a number of strategies to promote gender equality in Afghanistan (e.g. integration of gender equality in education). Furthermore, the participants' gender had a significant impact on their perceptions of gender equality. Female students had stronger perceptions about gender equality than their male counterparts did; they used a number of practices more frequently than males to promote gender equality. Compared to their male counterparts, female students were also more aware of roles of men, mullahs, education and awareness programs in promotion of gender equality in society.

SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB The global objective of the paper is to analyze the direct and indirect effects of gender inequality in education on GDP per capita of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries over the period from 1980 to 2014. Using an IV estimate and the GMM system estimator from Blundel and Bond (1998), the results show that an increase of gender equality index at primary-secondary and tertiary levels increases GDP per capita. Like the estimates using the gender equality index, a decrease of gender inequalities in education completion according to age groups has a beneficial effect on GDP per capita of the sample countries. As a result, CEMAC countries need to implement policies that reduce gender inequalities in education for sustainable economic growth. Also, an indirect negative impact of political instability, oil shocks and adolescent fertility on GDP is established.

TI Democratization processes in the EU - the perception of gender equality
SO FILOSOFIJA-SOCIOLOGIJA
AB Gender equality in line with women rights is one of the essential principles of democracy. The processes of democratization in the country can be considered through disclosure of population awareness towards gender equality.
   The paper aims to sociologically assess the democratization processes in Lithuania in respect of gender equality principle application. On the basis of quantitative studies, the paper analyzes reflection of women's rights and equality in the general concept of democracy; assesses the guarantors of equal rights and opportunities; discloses perception of gender discrimination, understanding of importance of the gender rights and their implementation level.
   It is argued that, although the Lithuanian population believe that gender equality in their country is implemented on large-scale, however, in public discourse the situation of the men rights implementation is more often seen better than that of women. It is noted that nearly one-third of Lithuanian residents perceive violations of gender equality and human rights to equality and existence of gender discrimination.

TI Patterns of Health-Related Gender Inequalities-A Cluster Analysis of 45
   Countries
SO JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB Purpose: The paper explores gender inequalities between 45 countries across 10 health indicators among adolescents and whether those differences in health correlate with gender inequality in general.
   Methods: Data from 71,942 students aged 15 years from 45 countries who participated in the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey were analyzed. For this purpose, 10 indicators were selected, representing a broad spectrum of health outcomes. The gender differences in the countries were first presented using odds ratios. Countries with similar risk profiles were grouped together using cluster analyses. For each of the 10 indicators, the correlation with the Gender Inequality Index was examined.
   Results: The cluster analysis reveals systematic gender inequalities, as the countries can be divided into seven distinct groups with similar gender inequality patterns. For eight of the 10 health indicators, there is a negative correlation with the Gender Inequality Index: the greater the gender equality in a country, the higher the odds that girls feel fat, have low support from families, have low life satisfaction, have multiple health complaints, smoke, drink alcohol, feel school pressure, and are overweight compared with boys. Four indicators show a divergence: the higher the gender equality in a country in general, the larger the differences between boys and girls regarding life satisfaction, school pressure, multiple health complaints, and feeling fat.
   Conclusions: Countries that are geographically and historically linked are similar in terms of the health risks for boys and girls. The results challenge the assumption that greater gender equality is always associated with greater health equality.

Latvia has decided to use the integrated approach to solve the problems related to gender equality, that means the principles of gender equality must be taken into consideration while solving the issues and forming a policy in any field of politics and at all levels, especially when the influence is anticipated directly upon society. The Author for several years has hold research to recognize situation and to define problems that keep away women from taking part in high level position jobs in public administration, especially because 69.9% of senior specialists and specialists in state administration are women, but among legislators, top-level state officials and managers women form the minority - 36.7%. This article provides an inside into gender equality policy in Latvia, as well as input from other partners like non-governmental organizations, which promote the public awareness about gender issues and the change of gender roles and stereotypes, and who are an important partner for governmental institutions in the development of gender equality policy and gender mainstreaming. Paper also examines Latvia's practice in dealing with gender equality problems. Finally, to improve the situation of women in leading public positions in Latvia, the authors offer recommendations and possible solutions.

TI The direction of gender equality policy in Britain post-Brexit: towards
   a masculinised Westminster model
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
AB This article examines gender equality policy in Britain, pre-and post-Brexit. Through a gendered analysis of European Union (EU) directives over forty years, we examine which policies have been key to Britain's gender equality agenda. We find that the EU's gender equality framework has been particularly integral to the advancement of 'class-based' policies, which seek to ameliorate inequalities that arise from the sexual division of labour. Taken together, we argue that the impact of Brexit risks directly rolling back these class-based gains. This is as a result of a shift away from a more consensual style of policymaking at the supranational level, towards a top-down, adversarial and masculinised Westminster Model, which marginalises women from decision-making fora. As it stands, advancements in gender equality policies are unlikely to be regained in the current political climate due to the absence of the stimulus of the EU for domestic gender equality reform.

The positions of the social partners are analysed using three key policy issues of importance to gender equality: the initiative on work-life balance; the European Pillar of Social Rights and the European Semester. We argue that social partners play a crucial role in shaping EU gender policy both within and outside social dialogues. They influence the form and instruments of the EU's gender equality policy; shape the meaning of gender equality and participate in the broader conflict between the EU's economic and social goals which is crucial for the future of the EU's gender policies.

AB Personal laws are mired with controversies on questions of gender equality. In India, where each community is governed by its own sets of personal laws, Muslim Personal Law, especially, is perceived to further gender inequality. This paper analyses such gender inequality concerns about the Muslim personal laws in context of property rights and right of dissolution of marriage. This paper argues that gender inequality in India stems from deep rooted cultural patriarchy without having any religious backing and such inequality is further endorsed by discriminatory laws. This paper argues that the despicable condition of Muslim women in India is due to ignorance of usul-ul-fiqh because of which they do not assert the rights guaranteed to them by Islam. Lack of knowledge of usul-ul-fiqh perpetuates the prevalent popular misconception of Muslim personal law as being oppressive to woman when in reality it gives them equal rights.

AB Historically, a gender pay gap in participation, employment and earnings of women is exhibited all over the world. The pay gap issue and employment of women may vary across countries, economies and cultures. In the current work, we present some data of gender inequality at work and the possible contributing factors to this persisting phenomenon. The recent global financial crisis and austerity measures may have resulted in increased gender inequality at work and put a pressure for women to work for less or enter professions with lower earnings. The data indicate that internationally, progress in gender equality at work is stalled during receccion. This is particularly important for the Balkan countries which have exhibited some progress in gender equality at work over the past years but was stalled during the recent global economic recession.

TI The maintenance of gender inequality in South African tertiary educated
   heterosexual couples
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY STUDIES
AB Gender equality has been found to benefit individual and couple well-being. However, much of what is known about the uptake of gender equality ideas in intimate heterosexual relationships is based on individual data from tertiary educated groups in the global North. South African research has also relied on individual data, but has predominantly utilized low socio-economic status samples. Locally, research is therefore needed that employs dyadic data, and specifically targets higher socio-economic and tertiary educated couples who are more likely to have been exposed to and adopt gender equality ideas. Subsequently, using a feminist social constructionist framework, we explored gender constructions by interviewing 14 heterosexual university student couples about gender ideas and practices in their relationships. We used an inductive thematic analysis method to analyze the dyadic interview data. We found that the couples were aware and supportive of gender equality, and portrayed themselves as having transcended gender inequality. However, we identified restrictive traditional gender constructions which were unseen, or deemed chosen or harmless by the participants. We conclude that more needs to be done to create awareness of, and challenge these unproblematised gender ideas amongst higher socio-economic groups that may believe that they have transcended gender inequality in relationships.

TI Measuring socio-economic gender inequality: Toward an alternative to the
   UNDP Gender-Related Development Index
SO FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB This paper assesses the United Nations Development Program's (UNDP) Gender-Related Development Index (GDI). Although the GDI has increased attention on gender equality in human development, it suffers from several limitations. A major problem is that it conflates relative gender equality with absolute levels of human development and thus gives no information on comparative gender inequality among countries. Using the same indicators as the GDI, the paper constructs a Relative Status of Women (RSW) index, which demonstrates how using a measure of gender equality that abstracts from levels of development results in very different country rankings. However, the RSW is not an ideal measure of gender inequality. The GDI indicators are not the most appropriate ones for measuring gender inequality and hence both the RSW and the GDI have limited validity. The paper concludes by offering a conceptual framework that provides the basis for an alternative measure of gender inequality.

TI A geographical analysis of gender inequality in literacy among Muslims
   of West Bengal, India (2001-2011)
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB Muslim community is a socio-economically backward section in Indian states wherein gender inequality in literacy is a highlighting problem. This manuscript is a modest attempt to analyse geographical organization of Muslims' gender inequality in literacy rate covering the districts of West Bengal. The objectives of this study are to measure the degree of gender inequality in literacy rate of Muslims in opposition of total population following by analysis of regional pattern during 2001-2011; to present a comparative study between Muslim and non-Muslim female literacy in West Bengal; and to identify the determinant factors responsible for low Muslim female literacy rate in West Bengal. The data for this study has been collected from Census of India concerning religion and sex wise database (2001 and 2011) and Indiastat. Coefficient of equality is adopted to draw the degree of gender inequality while GIS tool ArcMap is used for portraying regional organization. The findings reveal that gender inequality in Muslim literacy rate has reduced significantly in most of the districts of this state and the rate of reduction in Muslim majority districts is higher than other districts; and Muslim female literacy rate in majority of the districts dominates on non-Muslim female literacy rate in 2011. Although there is a trend of reduction in gender inequality in West Bengal, equality in literacy should be the prime focus to policy makers for sustainable development of future generations.

SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB This paper uses 1974 to 2001 panel data for 31 sub-Saharan African and 10 Arab countries and Arellano-Bond estimations to empirically assess the impact on growth of an important indicator associated with MDG 3; namely the ratio of 15-24-year-old literate females to males. Our findings indicate that gender inequalities in literacy have a statistically significant negative effect that is robust to changes in the specification. In addition, it seems that gender inequality has a stronger effect on growth in Arab countries. Interestingly, we find that the interaction between openness to trade and gender inequality has a positive impact. This result suggests that trade-induced growth may be accompanied by greater gender inequalities.

TI Gender and justice in Plato
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Plato's proposal for the equality of the sexes remains one of the most controversial aspects of his argument in the Republic. I explore this argument with special emphasis an locating it within larger themes of the work, themes whose relevance to the argument on gender equality have often been ignored. On this basis, I find that Plato's defense of gender equality is serious, but that the foundation and the consequences of that argument have not usually been well understood. Plato's argument for gender equality rests on a distinctive view of human nature, and his elaboration of the consequences of pursuing gender equality reveal that a price would have to be paid for it that few are willing to accept. His argument would be considered by contemporary advocates of gender equality.

TI Measuring Gender Inequality in Great Britain: Proposal for a Subnational
   Gender Inequality Index
SO SOCIAL POLITICS
AB Tackling gender inequality is a key focus for both civil society and government policy in Great Britain (GB). Yet, there is currently no consensus on how to conceptualize or operationalize gender inequalities, nor any detailed measurement of gender inequalities at the subnational level, despite high levels of regional inequality. This is a barrier to the development and evaluation of gender equality programs and policies, and to holding the government accountable. To address this gap, we propose a framework for a subnational index of gender inequalities in GB based on a review of relevant indices, theoretical models, and policy. This framework was further developed in a workshop with stakeholders. We also scope the data currently available from survey and administrative sources to capture the proposed framework, highlighting gaps in our ability to comprehensively measure gender inequalities at the subnational level in GB.

TI Is there gender inequality in the impacts of energy poverty on health?
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB This paper aims to study the gender inequality in the health impacts of energy poverty. Using the Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2018 data, we examine the gender heterogeneous effects of energy poverty on residents' health. The empirical results indicate that energy poverty would increase the ratio of respiratory disease, hospitalization as well as the healthcare expenditure. The effects are moderated by housework time. Moreover, we explore the gender inequality of the health impacts and find that women's health is more severely impaired and the effect of gender inequality is heterogeneous between urban and rural areas. We further investigate the historical origins of intra-household division of labor and reveal that the root of gender inequality in the health effects of energy poverty is status inequality. The government should give the first priority to energy poverty alleviation through modern energy network construction. Providing the energy-deprived families with ventilation equipment and medical insurance should be considered as the next step. Finally, it is imperative to eradicate urban-rural dual structure and legislate to ensure gender equality in the whole society.

TI Gender Equality Strategies of Austrian Trade Unions: On the Way to
   Gender Justice?
SO OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SOZIOLOGIE
AB The representation of women in the structures of the Austrian trade unions has a long tradition and further progress has been made in the establishment of gender equality structures in the last decades. Despite these improvements, trade unions still show a deficit in gender equality, e.g. few women in leading positions or aims and contents of negotiations which are dominantly male oriented. The article discusses the question in which way approaches and strategies for the advancement of gender equality have been implemented in programmes and in selected policy areas of Austrian trade unions. One of the basic problems in the constitution of gender relations can be seen in the concept of labour. The dominant concept of labour in trade unions is limited to paid employment and largely ignores unpaid (care) work.

TI Gender equality bargaining: Developing theory and practice
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB It has long been recognised that collective bargaining is at the heart of industrial relations. Research on collective bargaining was largely gender blind; however, since the late 1980s, researchers have begun to examine how collective bargaining can progress gender equality in the workplace. The practice of negotiating for terms and conditions of employment to advance workplace gender equality is known as 'gender equality bargaining'. This article provides an overview of the development and debates around gender equality bargaining over the last 25 years. It shows how definitions and concepts have broadened so that 'gender equality bargaining' is now effectively a subset of a wider 'equality bargaining' project being implemented by some unions. Just as the concept of equality bargaining has expanded, so too has the range of gender equality bargaining items, reflecting the gendered needs of both male and female employees. This prompts the authors to question whether gender equality bargaining is becoming mainstreamed within collective bargaining and to consider possible attendant implications. This article concludes by framing the following articles in this special edition, highlighting the diverse subject areas which are being negotiated, the multiple approaches being used and the theoretical interdisciplinary approaches being applied to advance both the practice and scholarship of gender equality bargaining.

TI How internationally funded NGOs promote gender equality in horticulture
   value chains in Kenya
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB This article contributes to the literature on global value chains by examining how non-governmental organisations (NGOs) promote gender equality. NGOs have been instrumental in setting social standards that seek to institutionalise gender-sensitive governance structures. However, relatively little is known about their roles in doing so. Using in-depth empirical research on the Women@Work Campaign in the cut-flower sector in Kenya, the article examines how a coalition of Kenyan NGOs and an international NGO push for gender equality in global value chains. While the Kenyan NGOs do most of the actual work on the ground, the international NGO uses its position to facilitate and empower the local NGOs to do their work. Yet, we see that funding conditions hamper the local NGOs' efforts to promote gender equality. Overall, our analysis highlights that NGOs fulfil important roles in promoting gender equality in horticulture value chains but the requirements of the international aid system act as a constraint.

In the study, the effect of psychodrama group work about gender equality on perception and attitude towards gender equality was tested with the one group pretest-posttest experimental model. The study was conducted with 12 volunteer individuals aged 18 years old who did not participate in the gender equality group study. As data collection tools, Perception of Gender Scale (Altinova & Duyan, 2013), socio-demographic information form, a qualitative question and a process analysis conducted after each session were used. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 15.0 and it was found that group work with psychodrama method led to a significant increase in the participants' gender perception scores. In the content analysis of the qualitative stage, it is established that the responses of the participants were gathered in equal and not equal themes. In addition to raising awareness of gender roles, the group work motivates the changes these of role patterns.

SO SOCIAL INCLUSION
AB The social-democratic-inspired "Nordic model", with its agenda for gender equality, has been an important example for the development of political interventions to transform society but at the same time, it has functioned as an emerging gender normalising and stabilising structure. In the last decade it has also become the focus of antigender movements and ethno-nationalistic parties both as emblematic for the Nordic nations as well as a threat that must be destroyed to save the nation. This issue will elaborate further on gender equality as a node, a floating signifier in powerful and often contradictory discourses. We are inspired by scholarships of hope in a dialogue with articles that search for realistic utopias that might be considered to be "beyond gender equality". The included articles engage with the messiness and crossroads of gender equality in relation to the work-line, territories, neo-liberalism, religion, the crisis of solidarity and the success of anti-genderism agenda.

TI Religion and gender inequality: The status of women in the societies of

SO MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS
AB The status of women in society is very diverse worldwide. Among many important traits associated with the differentiation of gender inequality is religion, which itself must be regarded as a fluid concept with interpretations and practices 'embedded' and thus varying with respect to cultural and historical relations. Admitting the complexity of the issues, some religious norms and traditions can contribute to the formation of gender inequalities and to subordinate the role of women in society. Using an exploratory quantitative analysis, the influence of religiosity on gender inequality in social, economic and political spheres is examined. Three categories of states have emerged from the analysis: (a) states where the majority of inhabitants are without religious affiliation, which display the lowest levels of gender inequality; (b) Christian and Buddhist societies, with average levels of gender inequality; and (c) states with the highest levels of gender inequality across the observed variables, whose inhabitants adhere to Islam and Hinduism.

TI Gender Inequality Lowers Educational Aspiration for Adolescent Boys and
   Girls: A Multi-Level and Longitudinal Study in China
SO SEX ROLES
AB Adolescent students' educational aspiration is a crucial predictor of both concurrent academic achievement and educational attainment later in life. Past studies on educational aspiration have mostly focused on the role of individual factors and the immediate context but have neglected the role of the broader societal environment. The current study examined (1) how gender inequality shaped adolescents' long-term educational aspiration and (2) whether gender inequality affected boys and girls differently. We used the longitudinal data of the China Family Panel Studies (2010-2014), which included a sample of 3,464 adolescents from 25 provinces in China (49.5% girls; M-age = 12.56, SD = 1.74). Multilevel analyses showed that adolescents in provinces with higher levels of gender inequality reported lower educational aspiration four years later. This association remained significant after adjusting for baseline educational aspiration and multiple provincial and sociodemographic covariates. The effects of gender inequality did not differ between boys and girls, suggesting that gender inequality was detrimental for both boys' and girls' long-term educational aspiration. The current study highlights the important role of gender inequality in education and underscores the importance of looking beyond individual factors and the proximal context in understanding adolescents' educational aspiration. Our findings suggest the importance of reducing socio-structural gender biases and institutional impediments (e.g., expectations to perform gendered role, women's underrepresentation) which constrain both girls' and boys' educational aspiration and development.

This contribution assesses the influence of this process on the development of the Belgian women's policy agencies and its gender equality policies. It argues that while the characteristics of the Belgian federal system-its asymmetrical structure and dual, centrifugal nature-stimulate the development of diverging structures, the nature of the issue-the cross-cutting character of gender inequality, the hegemonic approach to gender inequality-and the absence of national civil society actors push towards a convergence of policy approaches across different policymaking institutions.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY
AB Female life expectancy exceeds male life expectancy in almost every country throughout the world. Nevertheless, cross-national variation in the sex gap suggests that social factors, such as gender equality, may directly affect or mediate an underlying biological component. In this article, we examine the association between gender equality and the sex gap in mortality. Previous research has not addressed this question from an international perspective with countries at different levels of development. We examine 131 countries using a broad measure of national gender equality that is applicable in both Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and Highly Developed Countries (HDCs). We find that the influence of gender equality is conditional on level of development. While gender equality is associated with divergence between female and male life expectancies in LDCs, it is associated with convergence in HDCs. The relationship between gender equality and the sex gap in mortality in HDCs strongly relates to, but is not explained by, sex differences in lung cancer mortality. Finally, we find that divergence in LDCs is primarily driven by a strong positive association between gender equality and female life expectancy. In HDCs, convergence is potentially related to a weak negative association between gender equality and female life expectancy, though findings are not statistically significant.

TI Feminist Approach to Discursive Critics of Gender Equality
SO SOCIOLOGIJA
AB The article illustrates how the quality of gender equality policies is constructed through policy debates in ways that are dependent on the different discursive, institutional and structural factors specific to various policy contexts. Discursive dynamics play an important role in shaping the meanings of gender.quality. The article discusses the relation between hegemonic discourses on gender equality policies and feminist presamptions and expectations. By discursive politics I mean the intentional or unintentional engaging of policy actors in conceptual disputes that result in meanings attributed to the terms and concepts employed in specific contexts. The consequences of these discursive processes are depoliticizing and degendering. The processes of bending gender equality to some other goal depoliticize the issue of gender equality, thus not representing gender equality as a political issue. One key element that is neutralized in the depoliticization is the 'dimension of conflict' that is relevant because it highlights power dynamics. Depoliticizing an issue tends to obscure its discordant relations, its hierarchy of power, which, if recognized, could have opened up possibilities for challenging that hierarchy. Depoliticization in gender equality is also found in the idea of degendering. This refers to how issues that were quite promisingly politicized and consciously gendered soon after became de-gendered - the gender dimension was reduced, neutralized, or abolished.

TI An ecological analysis of gender inequality and intimate partner
   violence in the United States
SO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB The purpose of this research was to assess the association between Gender Inequality Index and prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) among women and men at the state-level. Recently developed 2017 state-level prevalence estimates of IPV among a nationally-representative sample of U.S. non-institutionalized adults between 2010 and 2012 from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey was combined with calculated indexes for state-level gender inequality. Gender Inequality Index, created by the United Nations, reflects gender-based disadvantage in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation. Correlations and linear regressions were used to examine associations between gender inequality and IPV. Gender Inequality Index values ranged from 0.149 to 0.381. The lifetime prevalence of IPV ranged between 27.8% and 45.3% for women and between 18.5% and 38.6% for men. Across states, the Gender Inequality Index was positively correlated with the prevalence of any form of IPV (r = 0.28, p < .05) and psychological IPV among women (r = 0.41, p < .01). The adjusted regression model showed a positive association between gender inequality and psychological IPV among women (B = 1.61, SE = 0.57, p = .007). Structural changes to gender inequality may help to reduce occurrences of IPV and improve the wellbeing and livelihood of women and girls.

TI What prevents public and private workers in Japan from recognizing
   gender inequality?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Although the percentage of women in Japan's workforce has increased substantially over the last 30 years, gender inequality in terms of income and position has persisted. A major problem is the lack of consciousness around gender inequality in society. Our study aims to explore the factors, particularly the Japanese style of management and cultural norms, that prevent workers in the public and private sectors from recognizing gender inequality. The Working Life Survey data collected from 1999 to 2011 were used for empirical analysis. The research finds that while there are no significant differences in the perceptions of gender inequality between public workers and their private counterparts, the factors influencing their consciousness of gender inequality do differ. The article also discusses the implications of our findings for efforts to promote gender equality throughout the Japanese workforce. Points for practitioners Gender equality in the Japanese workplace is considerably low in a global context. Despite substantial gender gaps, the Working Life Survey of 1999-2011 reveals that 32.4% of 9231 workers answered that different treatment based on gender in Japanese workplaces is "fair" or "almost fair." Examining these data, the study finds that there are no significant differences in the consciousness of gender inequality between public workers and their private counterparts. In addition, while distinctive Japanese management practices are influential on private workers' consciousness of gender inequality, they do not affect that of public workers.

TI Gender Equality and Violent Behavior: How Neighborhood Gender Equality
   Influences the Gender Gap in Violence
SO VIOLENCE AND VICTIMS
AB Using a sample of 703 African American adolescents from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS) along with census data from the year 2000, we examine the association between neighborhood-level gender equality and violence. We find that boys' and girls' violent behavior is unevenly distributed across neighborhood contexts. In particular, gender differences in violent behavior are less pronounced in gender-equalitarian neighborhoods compared to those characterized by gender inequality. We also find that the gender gap narrows in gender-equalitarian neighborhoods because boys' rates of violence decrease whereas girls' rates remain relatively low across neighborhoods. This is in stark contrast to the pessimistic predictions of theorists who argue that the narrowing of the gender gap in equalitarian settings is the result of an increase in girls' violence. In addition, the relationship between neighborhood gender equality and violence is mediated by a specific articulation of masculinity characterized by toughness. Our results

TI Association between gender inequality index and child mortality rates: a
   cross-national study of 138 countries
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Gender inequality weakens maternal health and harms children through many direct and indirect pathways. Allied biological disadvantage and psychosocial adversities challenge the survival of children of both genders. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has recently developed a Gender Inequality Index to measure the multidimensional nature of gender inequality. The global impact of Gender Inequality Index on the child mortality rates remains uncertain.
   Methods: We employed an ecological study to investigate the association between child mortality rates and Gender Inequality Indices of 138 countries for which UNDP has published the Gender Inequality Index. Data on child mortality rates and on potential confounders, such as, per capita gross domestic product and immunization coverage, were obtained from the official World Health Organization and World Bank sources. We employed multivariate non-parametric robust regression models to study the relationship between these variables.
   Results: Women in low and middle income countries (LMICs) suffer significantly more gender inequality (p < 0.001). Gender Inequality Index (GII) was positively associated with neonatal (beta = 53.85; 95% CI 41.61-64.09), infant (beta = 70.28; 95% CI 51.93-88.64) and under five mortality rates (beta = 68.14; 95% CI 49.71-86.58), after adjusting for the effects of potential confounders (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: We have documented statistically significant positive associations between GII and child mortality rates. Our results suggest that the initiatives to curtail child mortality rates should extend beyond medical interventions and should prioritize women's rights and autonomy. We discuss major pathways connecting gender inequality and child mortality. We present the socio-economic problems, which sustain higher gender inequality and child mortality in LMICs. We further discuss the potential solutions pertinent to LMICs. Dissipating gender barriers and focusing on social well-being of women may augment the survival of children of both genders.

TI Linking gender differences with gender equality: A systematic-narrative
   literature review of basic skills and personality
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB There is controversy regarding whether gender differences are smaller or larger in societies that promote gender equality highlighting the need for an integrated analysis. This review examines literature correlating, on a national level, gender differences in basic skills-mathematics, science (including attitudes and anxiety), and reading-as well as personality, to gender equality indicators. The aim is to assess the cross-national pattern of these differences when linked to measures of gender equality and explore new explanatory variables that can shed light on this linkage. The review was based on quantitative research relating country-level measures of gender differences to gender equality composite indices and specific indicators. The findings show that the mathematics gender gap from the PISA and TIMMS assessments, is not linked to composite indices and specific indicators, but gender differences are larger in gender-equal countries for reading, mathematics attitudes, and personality (Big Five, HEXACO, Basic Human Values, and Vocational Interests). Research on science and overall scores (mathematics, science, and reading considered together) is inconclusive. It is proposed that the paradox in reading results from the interrelation between basic skills and the attempt to increase girls' mathematics abilities both acting simultaneously while the paradox in mathematics attitudes might be explained by girls being less exposed to mathematics than boys. On the other hand, a more nuanced understanding of the gender equality paradox in personality is advanced, in which a gene-environment-cultural interplay accounts for the phenomenon. Challenges for future cross-national research are discussed.

TI The European Gender Equality Index: Conceptual and Analytical Issues
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This article presents a composite indicator designed to measure and compare existing structural gender equality in the countries of the European Union. The construction of an index is always a complex task which requires making a great many important conceptual, analytical and empirical decisions. This complexity explains the wide variety of gender equality indices created during the last 25 years. All the proposed indices attempt to measure the same thing, gender (in)equality, but none of them define the concept they want to measure in exactly the same way, nor do they operationalize measurement in the same manner. Taking into account the methodology of these preceding approaches, this article explains the basis for the most important analytical and conceptual decisions made in constructing the European Gender Equality Index. The article also includes the overall scores obtained by the 27 European countries on this index, on its three basic dimensions (education, work and power), and on the eighteen indicators that make up its structure. With this data, corresponding to 2009, an adequate analysis of gender equality in Europe can be established.

AB Women are an important social force that comprehensively influences the country's development. Therefore, it is very important to clarify, supplement and perfect policies and laws, and promote the implementation of gender equality for women participating in social activities. In addition to the successes in gender equality, over the past time, gender stereotypes still exist, causing gender inequality, making women still a disadvantaged group in society. Therefore, in order to clarify, supplement, and perfect policies and laws on gender equality, at the same time, it is very important to promote the implementation of gender equality for women in social activities, which needs to prioritize and put first. On the basis of studying the State's legal documents, gender equality policy, and gender equality situation, this study proposes solutions to improve gender equality policy in Vietnam.

TI GENDER EQUALITY MEASUREMENTS IN LITHUANIA
SO TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB Gender inequality is the priority area of EU policy. Seeking to shape effective policies to combat with gender inequality and to measure achieved progress in this area; the indices of gender inequality play important role. There are many indicators of inequality representing different aspects on gender inequality ranging from social-economic to institutional and cultural issues. The main measures of gender inequalities can be found in the following areas: education; poverty; health; labor market; access to resources; education; globalization; governance; conflict and emergencies; human rights etc. However it is necessary to have one indicator which allows assessing gender inequality in all aspects to compare countries in terms of level of gender inequality.
   It is important to have good statistics disaggregated by gender. Such statistics helps to evaluate the status quo, inform policies, and stimulate and measure change by raising awareness amongst policy-makers and providing a foundation for development of new policies in this area. There are some limitations of certain statistics and the validity of certain indicators for gender inequality measurements. In addition the validity of certain indicators are questionable. There is a need for new indicator, covering all issues of gender inequalities. Integrated indicator of gender inequality is proposed in the paper. This indicator is based on multi-criteria analysis and normalization of several the most important gender inequality indicators being applied by various international institutions dealing with gender issues.

   Practice for Gender Equality
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
AB International and transnational commitments to gender equality require strategies that tackle root causes and prevailing attitudes that perpetuate disparities. In this article, we examine the role and impact of international development volunteers (IDV) as development actors who are well-placed for feminist transformational change, as they work in transnational spaces to influence, support, or reinforce changes in attitudes and behaviors towards gender equality and women's empowerment (GEWE). This qualitative study analyses data collected from 45 interviews in three countries (Malawi, Kenya and Uganda) to document partner organization perspectives on relational dynamics emerging from interactions with IDVs. Partner organization staff highlighted several notable positive and negative contributions to GEWE outcomes arising from day-to-day interactions with IDVs. These interactions shaped their understandings of GEWE, enhanced confidence for GEWE programming, and provided exposure to role models who can shape alternative attitudes and behaviors to gender equality. While the study revealed varying degrees of challenges and benefits for partner organizations working with volunteers specifically on gender equality, partner organization staff highlighted contributions made by IDVs to transnational spatial relations, as well as the transformational interactions that shaped these relations. Insights provided by partner country staff members offer subaltern perspectives and rich insights into the contributions of IDVs in gender equality programming and shed new light on the challenges and opportunities for fostering transnational feminist spaces of knowledge sharing, relationship building, and alternative practices.

TI The Role of Gender Inequality in the Obesity Epidemic: A Case Study from
   India
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Recent empirical evidence emphasizes the higher prevalence of overweight and obesity for women, especially in developing countries. However, the potential link between gender inequality and obesity has rarely been investigated. Using longitudinal data from India (IHDS 2005-11), we implement Hausman-Taylor and fixed-effect models to estimate the effect of different dimensions of gender inequalities on female overweight. This study demonstrates that the form of gender inequality or women's mistreatment differently affects female bodyweight. Indeed, we show that some forms of women's mistreatments (such as perceived community violence and age difference with husband) increase the risk of female overweight, whereas more severe forms of abuse such as child marriage increase the risk of underweight. Moreover, we also find that higher decision-making power and autonomy about outings are risk factors of weight gain and obesity, especially in urban settings, perhaps indicating a higher exposure to urban obesogenic lifestyles. To conclude, our results suggest that, although improving women's status in society may be a key action to address the epidemic of obesity, policies must also target hazardous habits that emancipation may imply in urban (obesogenic) environments.

TI Gender, mortality, and corporeal inequality
SO SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM
AB Most previous empirical analyses of gender inequality have focused on modern economic indicators such as income. The advancement of theory on gender stratification requires detailed analysis of indicators with greater endurance and prevalence in world-historical terms. Sex mortality differentials are presented as cross-cultural indicators of corporeal gender inequality, defined as differential access to basic bodily resources for life and health. Indeed, mortality differentials represent a more fundamental form of gender inequality, in that women first must be alive before they may be denied access to other resources such as equal pay. Analysis of United Nations and World Bank data on developed and developing countries evidence the importance of ecological, economic, and familial explanations in determining corporeal gender inequality. Women's familial roles are found to be more important for gender inequalities in death at younger ages, and women's economic roles are more important for death at older ages. Implications of the results for mortality decline and gender stratification theory are discussed.

TI Sexual and sexist harassment in Spanish universities: policy
   implementation and resistances against gender equality measures
SO JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB The legal mandate to mainstream gender equality in Spain's universities has led to the establishment of gender equality units and the adoption of gender equality policy plans and protocols against sexual harassment. This research looks at how gender equality policies have been implemented within universities and what resisting and facilitating factors have hindered and promoted their implementation. These questions are addressed by studying the implementation of the 'Protocol against sexual and sexist harassment' at the biggest public Spanish university, Madrid Complutense University. Through a combination of content analysis, interviews, and a survey involving the university community, we show how the implementation of university policies against sexual harassment is dependent on a combination of factors against (obstacles/resistances) and in favour (opportunities/alliances). These factors include the form of institutionalization that gender equality took within the university, the existing formal and informal institutions, inertial resistances, and prevailing ideas about gender equality. We argue that implementation of the protocol was impeded by the scant awareness of the prevalence of harassment in daily university life, and the concomitant acceptance, by the academic community, of the phenomenon as a 'normal' practice.

AB This study provides a contemporary portrait of Chinese journalists' perceptions and attitudes about gender equality, including their perceptions and attitudes about gender/equality and the status of gender equality in China; attitudes about media and professional practices; journalists' preference for news; journalists' ideas about the influence of media content on audiences; the role of journalism in gender equality; gender-related training among journalists; and professional practices in representing gender and disseminating the ideas of gender equality. The survey shows that 83.2% of the respondents believe media can play an important role in promoting gender equality. Journalists' perceptions and attitudes about gender equality are influenced by intertwining factors such as gender, professional practices, and the society. Given the likely bearing of these ideas and attitudes on their reporting, additional efforts are necessary to improve journalists' gender/equality awareness and to disseminate the ideas of gender equality in the media in China.

TI Participatory design meets gender equality at European higher education
   institutions
SO CODESIGN-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COCREATION IN DESIGN AND THE ARTS
AB Gender equality is among the sustainable development goals expected of higher education institutions (HEIs). This paper will explore the potential and implications of participatory design (PD) in the context of gender equality work in HEIs. We study the topic within a multinational, multidisciplinary consortium, which is working for gender equality in HEIs, using PD as a tool and inspiration. We identify a variety of local conditions shaping PD and gender equality work, divergent discourses on gender equality work, and several sources of friction regarding PD and gender equality work. We conceptualise PD for gender equality work as being highly contested and emergent, with multiple forces shaping its trajectory. PD needs to be sensitive towards local circumstances at the national and organisational level, both politically and ideologically. It needs to navigate within national and international politics and policies and consider different timescales beyond specific projects. It also needs to acknowledge that PD for gender equality entails design, discourse, and friction.

TI SIGNIFICANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENDER
   EQUALITY IN THE LABOUR MARKET
SO TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB Equality between men and women is not only an element of human natural rights, but it is also a presumption for the development of harmonious society and an indicator for development. Consequently, one of the most significant aims of the modern society is sufficient attention paid to strengthening of the ways and methods to implement equal opportunities for women and men. In the following article there is analyzed the significance of institutional factors for the implementation of gender equality in the labour market in Lithuania. The aim is to analyze the residents' approach towards the significance of institutional factors for the implementation of gender equality in the labour market in Lithuania after having reviewed implementation regulations of gender equality policy. Objectives are to review the institutional machinery for the implementation of gender equality policy, find out the residents' approach towards the ability of authorities to form and implement the underlying fields of activities and analyze women's and men's approach towards the significance of institutional factors in the implementation of gender equality in the labour market. The analysis of literature presents that implementation success of gender equality policy has to be secured by relevantly operating institutions, their clear structure, distribution of competences and functions, and close cooperation between different structures. The outcomes of the questionnaire survey enable to argue that women's and men's state in the labour market a lot depends on the decisions taken by the authorities, their executed policy and ability to distinguish underlying activity fields. It is also necessary to highlight that there are more women than men stating that decisions of administrative institutions do not secure equal rights for men and women in the labour market in Lithuania, and they say that institutional factors are significant or very significant.

TI Gender (in)equality in Australia: good intentions and unintended
   consequences
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES
AB Gender inequality is a complex problem with multiple interrelated indicators (e.g. underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, gender pay gaps). Our academic community has been following a three-step 'script' to motivate organisations to act on gender inequality: we document the inequality, we build a business case for equality, and we advocate solutions to correct inequality. But too often, our well-meant messages have negative consequences. We may be inadvertently presenting gender inequality as an intractable problem and creating unrealistic expectations among stakeholders about gender equality benefits and gender inequality solutions. As stakeholders become impatient with Australia's slow progress toward gender equality, we may need to reconsider this strategy. Academic researchers may be more successful change agents if we are more deliberate about highlighting the interconnections among gender inequality indicators, identifying the organisational value of gender equality beyond financial performance, and advocating small-scale structural changes alongside large-scale interventions.

   equality policy agendas in the UK 2010-2015
SO BRITISH POLITICS
AB The UK Coalition era 2010-2015 was characterised as being detrimental to women. However, to date, research has not comprehensively examined the impact on gender equality of the Coalition's policies in different policy domains. This paper examines policies that were introduced to address gender inequality and policies that had a detrimental impact on gender equality during the five years of Coalition Government. We draw on a typology of gender equality policies which categorises policies as either addressing the class or status basis of gender inequalities and scholarships that demonstrates that the determinants of policy change will vary depending upon which type of policy is brought forward. We find that numerous status-based gender equality policies reached the government agenda as well as some class-based policies. However, this agenda setting activity around gender equality needs to be set against the Coalition's austerity policies, which removed significant provision for gender equality and set limits on the effectiveness of some new initiatives.

SE Advances in Gender Research
AB Purpose -This study will look at the relationship between norms on gender equality on the one hand and the level of gender equality in the political and socioeconomic sphere, the presence or absence of armed conflict, and general peacefulness on the other.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data on gender equality norms from the World Values Surveys, political and socioeconomic gender equality from the Global Gender Gap Index, armed conflict from the Uppsala Conflict Data Base, and general peacefulness from the Global Peace Index are analyzed in a bivariate correlation.
   Findings - The results show a significant association between norms on and attitudes toward gender equality and levels of political and socioeconomic gender equality, absence or presence of armed conflict, and level of general peacefulness.
   Research limitations - There is no data base on norms on and attitudes toward the use of violence which is why only levels of violence are included in the study.
   Social implications - The study shows that governments, aid agencies, NGOs and others working on conflict prevention and peace building need to focus on improving gender equality in order to achieve a sustainable decrease in conflict levels and an improvement in general levels of peacefulness.
   Originality/value - This study is original in that it looks at norms on gender equality on the individual level on the one hand and actual levels of both gender equality and violence in the society, including armed conflict on the other.

TI The micro-politics of collective bargaining: The case of gender equality
SO HUMAN RELATIONS
AB What are the drivers of collective bargaining to achieve gender equality in companies? Although much research has been done on this question, answers tend to focus exclusively on the institutional perspective and to neglect the social and power relations at work. We address this deficiency in this article by taking a micro-political perspective. We trace the trajectory of a collectively bargained gender equality policy in a French company over 14 years and examine how management and unions contribute to the process. Our results show that the construction of a coalition between management and unions around gender equality, as well as the form taken by the bargained policy, are closely linked to the capabilities that these actors possess and mobilise. This study contributes to the understanding of gender equality bargaining and, more generally, to the micro-politics of collective bargaining. In doing so, it aims to connect organisation studies and industrial relations.

TI Gender equality, education, economic growth and religious tensions nexus
   in developing countries: A spatial analysis approach
SO HELIYON
AB Gender inequality is a more pronounced phenomenon in developing countries, which may be rooted in poor governance, and inadequate social and religious institutions. Therefore, this research tests the effects of religious tensions, governance, economic growth, and education on gender equality in a panel of 59 developing countries from 1995-2015. Moreover, religious tensions may have spillovers in neighboring countries in this modern age of media and globalization. Therefore, we apply Spatial Durbin and Autoregressive models to consider spatial autocorrelation in the religious tensions model. We find that both gender equality and religious tensions have spillovers in neighboring countries. Moreover, reducing religious tensions and increasing economic growth promote gender equality and have positive spillovers in neighboring countries as well. Bureaucratic quality has a positive effect on gender equality in home countries and has insignificant spillovers on gender equality in the neighboring countries. However, education could not affect gender equality in developing countries.

It will examine the interplay of male and female identities in the maritime world of the past through the analysis of works of art depicting shipwrecks. This will make it possible to investigate the social representation of gender roles and produce ground-breaking research on the consequences of past history in current gender conceptions. The importance of this research is reflected in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes Goal 5, 'promoting national and international efforts towards gender equality and women's empowerment'. Since gender inequalities are still deep-rooted in the maritime profession, this article believes that requestioning the vital role of women in the past and asking the right questions can advance gender equality.

TI Pathogen prevalence is associated with cultural changes in gender
   equality
SO NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
AB Gender equality has varied across time, with dramatic shifts in countries such as the United States in the past several decades. Although differences across societies and changes within societies in gender equality have been well documented, the causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars have posited that such shifts have been driven by specific events (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social movements (such as feminism and women's liberation) or general levels of social development (for example, modernization theory(1)). Although these factors are likely to have been partly responsible for temporal variations in gender equality, they provide fairly intermediate explanations void of a comprehensive framework. Here, we use an ecological framework to explore the role of key ecological dimensions on change in gender equality over time. We focus on four key types of ecological threats/affordances that have previously been linked to cultural variations in human behaviour as potential explanations for cultural change in gender equality: infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and climatic stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in the United States over six decades (1951-2013) are linked to reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates of infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality. Results were robust, holding when we controlled for other ecological dimensions and for collectivism and conservative ideological identification (indicators of more broadly traditional cultural norms and attitudes). Furthermore, the effects were partially mediated by reduced teenage birth rates (a sign that people are adopting slower life history strategies), suggesting that life history strategies statistically account for the relationship between pathogen prevalence and gender inequality over time. Finally, we replicated our key effects in a different society, using comparable data from the United Kingdom over a period of seven decades (1945-2014).

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The objective of this study was to investigate and analyze the status and influential factors of gender equality awareness, self-esteem, and subjective well-being in school-age boys and girls. The results can help schools and teachers provide more effective gender equality and mental health education. In the study, 284 valid questionnaires were collected from a total of 323 school-age boys and girls in the Hunan Province, China (effective response rate of 87.93%). The questionnaire covered gender equality awareness, self-esteem, and subjective well-being, with the influencing factors analyzed through multiple linear regression. There was a significant correlation among children's gender equality awareness in all areas examined (family, occupation, and school), with both boys and girls having the lowest awareness of gender equality in occupational fields. The children's self-esteem and subjective well-being were significantly correlated as well. Gender equality awareness, self-esteem, and subjective well-being among boys and girls reflected different influential factors. Androgynous traits (neither feminine nor masculine) were conducive to the development of gender equality awareness and self-esteem among the children. Therefore, schools and teachers need to provide gender equality and mental health education according to the specific psychological characteristics of each boy and girl.

SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB Objective: To determine the gender equality attitudes of nursing students studying at a private university, the sociodemographic factors affecting gender equality, and the difference in gender attitudes between Turkish and foreign students.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Faculty of Nursing at Near East University in March and April 2019. Three hundred six students studying in Turkish and English nursing programs in the thirdyear of study were included in the research. A sociodemographic questionnaire and the GEM scale were used as the data collection tools.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 21.11 +/- 3.88. 76.1% of the students were female and 33.3 students were foreign. The Gender Equality Men scores of the Turkish and foreign students were significantly different (p=0.001). Gender, the educational level of the father, a history of violence in the family, and talking about family and sexual issues affected the gender attitudes of all students.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that culture, gender, family education, and a history of violence in the family affected the gender equality scores of the nursing students.

TI Redistribution and recognition: An analysis of gender in/equality
   discourse on Nigerian female blogs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL POLITICS
AB This article examines the dynamics of representation between cultural and economic forms of gender inequality on Nigerian female blogs. Through a thematic analysis of 253 comments retrieved from five female-authored blogs, I draw on prominent cases of gender inequality in Nigeria, such as 'President Muhammadu Buhari's position on his wife' and the 'rejection of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill'. The analysis showed that blog discussions among females in Nigeria suggest extensive intolerance to cultural change, especially in comparison to the more positive attitude towards redistribution. To tackle this complexity, I argue that gender equality advocacy in Nigeria should commence mainly from a redistributive standpoint. This needs to be accompanied by the ulterior aim of achieving recognition. Overall, the study contests the idea that identity politics is threatening to replace the issue of redistribution on the global political agenda by highlighting the primacy of redistributive politics in blog discourse. It enriches media studies and gender research by providing rare insight into the practical connections between cultural and economic politics of gender inequality in an online discursive context.

TI Engaging feminist pedagogies to support equality bargaining in academia
SO GENDER AND EDUCATION
AB Despite decades of Equal Opportunity legislation, gender inequality persists in Australian universities. This is largely due to the shaping of universities by new market principles, discourses of individualisation that render the asymmetry of gender relations invisible, and privileging masculine epistemologies. Concurrently, industrial relations have been decentralised, and individual universities negotiate staff pay and working conditions through local Enterprise Bargaining (EB). Whilst EB mitigates the development of a national gender-equity framework for universities, trade unions operating through inequality regimes rarely prioritised gender equity even when they did lead national negotiations. Therefore, within a context of complex inequalities in higher education and trade unions, this paper explores how feminist pedagogies can facilitate equality bargaining and gender equality in academia. It also suggests that equality bargaining is especially important during (current) times of austerity when the removal of gender-equality support structures within trade unions generally occur.

TI The Impact of Secularity on Attitudes of Gender Equality: A Multi-Level
   Analysis of 49 Nations
SO COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY
AB This research uses a series of hierarchical linear regression models fitted to data from the 2014 World Values Survey (WVS) and national statistics for 49 countries to specify the relationship between variables at the macro, meso, and micro level with attitudes of gender equality. In addition to the development of an updated and more robust Gender Equality Scale, the findings show that economic development increases support for gender equality, in line with Inglehart's postmaterialist hypothesis. A history of communist rule and income inequality also increase attitudes of gender equality. Secularity has the greatest explanatory power in the equation; the results show that being educated, female, and less religious significantly increases one's likelihood to support gender equality.

   inequality: Evidence from global data
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB This study empirically investigates the link between militarization and women's labor force participation rate, and gender inequality. Applying a panel cointegration method for 74 countries for 1990-2017, the study demonstrates the impact of militarization for different country groups, showing a significant negative association between indicators of militarization and women's labor force participation, and gender equality. The findings suggest that militarization is likely to decrease women's labor force participation and increase gender inequality. When considered with the previous literature, an implication of the study is that militarization contributes to lower economic growth via the channel of higher gender inequality.

TI Are Dimensions of Gender Inequality Uniformly Associated With Human
   Values?
SO EUROPES JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB A previous work of Schwartz and Rubel-Lifschitz (2009, https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015546) highlighted the association between human values and gender equality. However, gender equality is not a monolith. Indeed, it is a multidimensional phenomenon. We started from this multidimensionality to understand how the relative importance of human values varies through the different dimensions of Gender Equality Index (GEI)-namely work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health. We have designed a cross-national study based on secondary data analysis from international databases (i.e., European Social Survey [ESS] and GEI). Through the Bayesian correlational analysis of 18 European countries, findings revealed that 1) universalism, benevolence and self-direction are strongly and positively correlated to gender equality; 2) security, power and achievement are strongly and negatively correlated to equality while 3) conformity, tradition, stimulation, and hedonism have weak/non-significantweak/non-significant correlation coefficientscoefficients with gender equality. Relevance to cultural values and ideologies that support social equality are discussed. Furthermore, we find that some values are related to certain specificspecific gender equality dimensions. Our results provide a more fine-grainedfine-grained analysis compared to previous findings, by outlining a more complex scenario.

TI Green financing of eco-innovations: is the gender inclusivity taken care
   of?
SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The OECD countries are in pursuit of the betterment of environmental quality based on their capability of Eco-innovation. This progression might pave their ways in attaining the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs). Developing a green financing channel for funding is necessary for the sustenance of these projects. However, the potential impact of this project financing mechanism is conditional on the social balance in the economic system. Gender inequality being a major social issue in the OECD countries, it might pose a predicament in attaining the full potential of the green financing of eco-innovations. It is anticipated that the eco-innovation endeavors in the OECD countries are not gender-inclusive, and hence, gender inequality might limit the cognitive aptitude of these endeavors. The present study intends to assess the moderating role of gender inequality on the impact of green financing of eco-innovations for the OECD countries. Using the dynamic elasticity modeling approach, the study finds that the presence of gender inequality dampens the potential of green financing mechanisms to boost eco-innovations. The social imbalance caused by gender inequality also weakens the impacts of the structural and institutional environment to foster innovations. Based on the findings of the study, an SDG-oriented policy framework has been suggested.

TI Section 28's Potential to Guarantee Substantive Gender Equality in Hak c
   Procureur general du Quebec
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND THE LAW
AB Hak c Procureure generale du Quebec is an action that has combined four distinct challenges to An Act Respecting the Laicity of the State. In this article, I canvass section 28 doctrine and jurisprudence to outline the purpose and role of section 28 in order to understand how it might operate in the challenge undertaken in Hak. To do so, I conduct a purposive analysis of section 28. In my opinion, section 28 has two distinct purposes: first, it acts as a "gender equality interpretive tool" that requires judges to choose constitutional interpretations that favour substantive gender equality and, second, it ensures that substantive gender equality cannot be overridden by anything else in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Within these broad purposes, I also discuss section 28's status as an interpretive provision that confers the substantive right to substantive equality, and I offer illustrations of the gender equality tool in case law. I conclude with the potential of section 28 to operate as a gender equality tool in Hak, including its potential to do so intersectionally.

TI Gender Inequality in Terms of Health and Nutrition in India: Evidence
   from National Family Health Survey-3
SO PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB Gender inequality is one of the major problems faced by the human society. It refers to unequal and biased treatment towards female. Fortunately, over a period of time, things have slowly changed. However, this is still a very serious and widespread problem in society. National Family Health Survey -3 (NFHS-3) was released recently by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare published by International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The report provides information on health and nutrition for both children and adults. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze the gender inequality on the basis of gender parity index with respect of health and nutrition. The findings show a significant gender bias against female (both children and adults) in most states of India. The author has also estimated the Equally Distributed Life Expectancy Index for the major states of India.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

In this paper, we draw on Acker's (1990) concept of gendered organisations to present a case study of a tourism department preparing to apply for an international gender equality charter-accreditation, Athena SWAN. Ketso was used as a method to try to stimulate active involvement of all staff members and breakdown traditional hierarchies within the team, and to encourage honest discussion about gender and inequality in this context. This was only partially successful, however, and we discuss how explicit focus on gender (in)equality through this process both enabled discussion of usually ignored topicsandrevealed entrenched gender power dynamics and structural and institutional barriers to reform. The paper illustrates both the possibilities of gender equality initiatives like Athena SWAN to highlight many of the gendered practices of tourism academia and the limitations they hold for overcoming deep-rooted gender inequality.

AB Taken-for-granted rules are difficult to change. The Australian construction industry is one example, where despite considerable attempts at regulating gender equality by government and others, the industry remains steadfastly male dominated. This article investigates the drivers (i.e. why) and processes (i.e. how) of change with regard to gender equality in the workplace. Using institutional entrepreneurship, we provide insight into the change towards gender equality in the Australian construction industry. We collect data from two Australian construction companies and, drawing on interviews conducted with business leaders, look at how new meanings around gender equality and diversity are negotiated. We find that while gender equality is an important point of focus for both companies, discrepancies remain between perceptions and reality as well as people's level of readiness. We conclude with implications for theory and future research.

   MDGs
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB This article addresses some central issues for the Post-2015 Development Agenda from a Southern perspective on gender equality and women's human rights. To answer this question, it first examines what lessons can be learned from the decade or so of implementation of the MDGs. The article focuses on two meso' challenges: breaking down issue silos, and integration/participation. It argues that progress towards gender equality will depend on whether the larger development framework addresses central issues such as the growing inequality, informalisation and precariousness of work and incomes that have gone hand in hand with the globalisation of the past three decades. Within a framework that tackles head on the causes and consequences of rising global and national inequality, progress on women's rights requires recognition that gender inequality is pervasive across multiple and intersecting issues. Effectively addressing women's needs and rights requires the building of bridges across policy silos through the integration of issues and participation by women.

TI The Influence of Human Capital on GDP Dynamics: Modeling in the COVID-19

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB COVID-19 struck labor markets around the world, exposing and exacerbating the gender inequalities within the human capital structure. The last, in its turn, jeopardizes the return of the national economies to the growth trajectory undermined by pandemic impact. The authors assume that COVID-19 disproportionately affected the employment rates of women and men, which led to increased gender inequality in the labor market, which, in turn, affected GDP growth rates in the EU. To prove this hypothesis two research questions are discovered: 1) whether there was a different correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU and indicators of the labor market for women and men; and 2) whether there was a link between the growth of gender inequality in the EU labor market and the GDP dynamics in these countries. The analysis of the correlation between the number of cases of COVID-19 and indicators of the labor market in the EU revealed faster growth of women's unemployment rates compared to men's ones as the COVID-19 incidence unfolded. Multiple linear regression and factor analysis have been used to investigate the influence of gender inequality in the labor market on GDP dynamics. Despite the methodological limitations, the proposed model is both a sound argument and an analytical basis in favor of gender-responsive economic recovery backed by the systematic and consistent gender equality policy of a government.

AB Among all the industrial activities being developed around the world, the construction sector is certainly the most male-dominated sector. For this reason, this project analyzes the opinion regarding gender equality held by workers in this sector in Spain. In order to accomplish this goal, a web survey of 1353 building engineers across the country has been conducted (48.7% men, 51.3% women), which makes it the biggest sample analyzed to date. The results show men, older workers, self-employed, and workers having higher levels of revenues in the construction sector as those with the most unfavorable attitude towards gender equality in the profession. These results also reveal the groups where it is most needed to implement awareness-raising actions in order for the gender equality policies to be successful in the Building Engineering sector in Spain.

AB Gender inequality is one of the triggers of the idea of gender equality. In instilling the values of gender equality, the family has a strategic function because the family is the first educational place for children. In the family environment of children learning anything, including behavior. The formation of the behavior of children in the family can be determined by the behavior of the parents of children that can be observed in everyday life. One of the behaviors studied with the family is a gender-related behavior. Therefore, in a family environment in which gender relations need to be built between family members understanding the differences and roles are balanced so that no aggrieved parties. Habituation treatment and the division of roles between members of the family should be balanced both in men and women and not get caught in the stereotype attached to gender differences.

AB This paper presents the results of statistical analysis of workplace gender equality in OECD countries, including a time series regression analysis from 1974 to 1986.  Two models of approaches to gender inequality in labour markets are set up - a 'liberal' and a 'collective' model - and the characteristics of each examined for their effects on measures of gender equality.  The results suggest that aspects of the 'collective' model, such as a centralised industrial relations system, high levels of public employment relative to total employment and sustained expenditure on active labour market programmes are most likely to deliver relatively high earnings for women, although not all these factors are conductive to high levels of female participation in labour markets.  No clear evidence was found to support the efficacy of legislative measures in the pursuit of gender equality.  The paper argues that the emancipatory potential of legislative moves will be best enhanced within a 'collective' framework.

TI Gender Equality as a General Interest of a Pluralistic Society: An
   Analysis of Constitutional Precedent in Colombia
SO BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH
AB The article explores the relationship between the legal principles of general interest and gender equality, both consecrated in Colombia's 1991 Constitution. Through an analysis of the precedents set by the Constitutional Court, the article provides a hermeneutical approximation of the behaviour of jurisprudence concerning the general interest. It demonstrates how this principle could be used to foster a more encompassing definition of gender equality. The precedents set by the Constitutional Court have opened up the spectrum of women's rights so as to grasp their relation to the principle of general interest as well as their basis as fundamental rights.

TI Gender equality in labour force participation, economic growth and
   development in South Africa
SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Studies in feminist literature have found that development effects gender equality in labour force participation, but gender equality has also been found to effect economic growth. These two streams of literature, however, lie largely distinct with few studies directly investigating the inter-relationships between development, growth and gender equality, and as such, this lack of knowledge curtails the development of appropriate policy. This study explores the effect of development on gender equality in labour force participation and the effect of this gender equality on economic growth in South Africa on a quarterly basis from 2008 to 18 using Autoregressive Distributive Lag models. Economic development is found to have a positive effect on gender equality in the long run while greater female participation in the labour market is found to have no effect on growth. These results suggest that further development should be prioritised to support gender parity in economic opportunities in South Africa.

TI Disciplined discourses: The logic of appropriateness in discourses on
   organizational gender equality policies
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Organizational gender equality policies must address critical issues in organizations, as well as challenge hierarchies and the unequal distribution of power and resources. At the same time, they are reliant on acceptance by organizations when developing an official course of action. On the basis of a neo-institutional perspective, this study investigates how gender equality discourses are disciplined so that they fit organizational expectations by maintaining the rationality myth of the organization. The empirical analysis of four Swiss organizations demonstrates that, although they intend to reduce gender inequalities, their gender equality policies are shaped by a logic of appropriateness that leads to a continuous reproduction of heteronormativity within gender equality policies. This study thus contributes to the understanding of how the logic of appropriateness protects the heteronormative matrix in organizations by disciplining gender equality discourses.

TI Does Trust Always Help Gender Role Attitudes? The Role of Individualism
   and Collectivism
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Social trust has a complex interrelationship with attitudes toward gender equality. Social trust has its origins in exchange relationships in preindustrial societies, lowering uncertainty in transactions and easing interpersonal exchanges. The degree to which this trust was extended to opportunities for women in commercial and societal roles, however, differed across cultures. Prior literature finds attitudes toward individualism and collectivism have significant implications for gender equality and patriarchal attitudes. We combine these ideas arguing that the degree to which social trust fosters gender equality depends upon the degrees of individualism and collectivism. Employing World Values Survey data across countries over time, we find that with low levels of individualism, and high degrees of collectivism, higher levels of trust are not effective in reducing the prevalence of gendered patriarchal attitudes-in fact it entrenches them further, worsening gender equality. However, as individualism rises, and collectivism falls, higher levels of trust become effective in reducing the prevalence of patriarchal beliefs. Thus, collectivistic beliefs stand as a barrier to future improvements in women's equality and economic rights in many societies; preventing social trust from being extended beyond traditional gendered roles.

TI Education and training as prerequisites for overcoming the difficulties
   in the implementation of ethical and legal norms concerning gender
   equality in a social environment
SO TEMIDA
AB In this paper, the author advances the thesis that in today's Serbia there is no social consensus concerning the unequal treatment of men and women, and that "patriarchal syndrome", stereotypes and prejudices are still widely present and are greatly influencing the functioning of social mechanisms and the achievement of gender equality. In Serbia the process of achieving the equal treatment of women de jure is still in progress. With the absence of consensus, which is a prerequisite for "transmitting" social values encompassed by gender equality, the chances are little that equality will be attained de facto. This paper is meant as a warning that not all types of women's inequality are easily noticeable, as well as that on the social scene there are many different and intertwined social actors which influence dealing with the problem of inequality, implementation of international and domestic legal acts, ethical standards, and taking steps to introduce mechanisms for achieving women's equality in society. One of the prerequisites for overcoming these difficulties is a system of education and educational resources, which promote the idea of gender equality.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of gender inequality on economic growth in Africa. To this end, a dynamic panel model was estimated by the generalized method of moments (Arellano and Bond 1992). Our results indicate that there is a negative and significant relationship to the 10 % threshold between gender inequality index (GII) and economic growth (GDP).

TI Promoting gender equality through the use of management control systems:
   a case study in Japan
SO ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB PurposeThis study examines how formal and cultural management control systems (MCSs) are used to support the promotion of gender equality through a case study of a Japanese bank.Design/methodology/approachA case study was adopted to investigate the use of formal and cultural MCSs in promoting gender equality. Primary data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with managers experienced in promoting gender equality. Then, the data were analysed by reading the interview answers repeatedly and coding interviewees' comments to generate themes.FindingsThe findings indicate that both formal and cultural MCSs can be critical aspects in promoting gender equality. The use of cultural MCS fostered norms and cultures over time that enhances the process of formal MCS to achieve gender equality. Formal MCS was also designed and utilised under the constructed norms and cultures to promote gender equality. Furthermore, the use of formal MCS contributes to shaping norms and cultures that encourage gender equality by controlling and discussing the process of promoting gender equality.Originality/valueThis study clarifies how formal and cultural MCSs can be used to promote gender equality, which is an unresolved issue in Japanese companies. Mechanisms for companies in male-dominated societies are also provided to promote gender equality in terms of MCSs.

TI A scoping review on the association of early childhood caries and

SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB AimThe objective of this scoping review is to present current evidence regarding the association between early childhood caries (ECC) and maternal-related gender inequality.MethodsTwo independent reviewers performed a comprehensive literature search using three databases: EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. Literature published in English from 2012 to 2022 was included in the search and was restricted to only primary research by using the following key terms: "dental caries", "tooth decay", "gender", "sex", "preschool", "toddler," and "infant". The included studies were limited to those reporting an association between ECC and maternal aspects related to gender inequality. Titles and abstracts were screened, and irrelevant publications were excluded. The full text of the remaining papers was retrieved and used to perform the review. The critical appraisal of selected studies was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools.ResultsAmong 1,103 studies from the three databases, 425 articles were identified based on publication years between 2012 and 2022. After full-text screening, five articles were included in the qualitative analysis for this review. No published study was found regarding a direct association between ECC and maternal gender inequality at the level of individuals. Five included studies reported on the association between ECC and potential maternal-gender-related inequality factors, including the mother's education level (n = 4), employment status (n = 1), and age (n = 1). Regarding the quality of the included studies, out of five, two studies met all JBI criteria, while three partially met the criteria.ConclusionsBased on the findings of this scoping review, evidence demonstrating an association between gender inequality and ECC is currently limited.

TI How can the success of gender equality policies be evaluated? Criteria
   and methodological tools
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP
AB After the gender mainstreaming strategy was approved at the 4th World Conference on Women of United Nations (Beijing, 1995), gender equality has been increasingly recognized as a key element to be included not only in the phases of policy design and formulation but also in the evaluation. In this regard, for the last decades different theoretical-methodological proposals have been developed for evaluation and gender equality. This research note aims at contributing to the emerging literature and practice on evaluation of gender equality policies. Specifically, based on the review of the existing literature on evaluation and gender equality, it reflects on what does assessing success mean and how to do it in the case of gender equality policies. The results show the relevance of defining success of this kind of polices as well as the specific criteria to evaluate them, in a contextualised and negotiated way. The results also suggest using several methodological tools - developed in the field of gender equality policies and evaluation-in order to capture the complexity of the change in gender equality.

TI Do parliamentary gender quotas decrease gender inequality? The case of
   African countries
SO CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Many countries in Africa score very low on gender equality measures; yet, they have some of the highest percentages of women in parliament. They have managed to achieve significant representation of women in government through fast track measures such as the implementation of gender quotas. In the context offast track reform, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of such parliamentary gender quotas in general, and in particular of different types of quotas, for improving gender equality in African countries. Our empirical results suggest that although all mandated quota systems lead to an increase in the number of women in policy-making, the type of quota affects the de facto ability of women in parliament to influence legislative agendas and ultimately to improve the lives of women. Our findings have implications for the design of affirmative action measures targeting women's participation in the political process.

TI Analysis of equal gender opportunity in science and technology. The
   professional careers of women scientists and technologists
SO INTANGIBLE CAPITAL
AB Object: To analyze gender equality in the field of Science and Technology with the aim of determining the work trajectory of women scientists as well as the main difficulties that they have faced in their professional careers regarding promotion, pay and work-family balance. Moreover, the situation of women scientists in other countries is also analyzed. The results confirm the existence of gender inequality in the trajectory of women with professional careers devoted to Science and Technology. The final goal of this study is to determine the contribution of women who have pursued their professional careers in the field of Science at the highest level of training, as well as the proposals and actions aimed at young women scientists to enable them to achieve gender equality in their organizations.
   Design/methodology/focus: After the theoretical approach, a quantitative and qualitative methodology has been designed with a representative sample of women scientists and technologists from the Association of Women Researchers and Technologists (AMIT).
   Contributions and results: The few number of women engaged in the scientific field is made evident. It is also evident that the percentage of women scientists in Spain allows us to be optimistic about the development of scientific or technical careers when compared with the percentages in other countries. The results prove the existence of gender discrimination as well as the initiatives analyzed by women scientists that can be pursued, thereby adding new channels to be taken into account in this field.
   Originality/added value: The article constitutes a further step towards knowledge about gender equality and provides new channels for consideration in this field to help young women in Science to develop working environments that allow full gender equality to be achieved.

TI The woman as problem and solution-analysis of a gender equality
   initiative within the Swedish Rescue Services
SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB The aim of this article is to study how problem definitions of gender equality affect the possible outcomes of gender equality initiatives. The Swedish Municipal Rescue Services were chosen as the empirical example because they offer a workplace where women are greatly under-represented despite years of gender equality efforts. The article analyses how reasoning around gender equality shapes and constructs problem formulations around gender and equality. This article contributes to the debate on the conditions of gender equality founded on gender equality definitions, and how this relates to the potential for change. The gender equality efforts within the Rescue Services are problematized based on Bacchi's policy analysis model. We do so by analysing the applications attracted by a call for a gender equality initiative within the Municipal Rescue Services-A Fire Station for Everyone. The article argues that, to some extent, the problem definitions in this case undermine gender equality initiatives as they place women-whom they wish to recruit to the Rescue Services to make it more gender equal in a numerical sense-in a paradoxical position as both problem and solution. Nor do they problematize power issues. It is stated that the given problem descriptions do not leave a lot of room for change, but that the method used to analyse the problem descriptions can be an important tool for understanding why gender equality initiatives may struggle to achieve their intended objectives.

TI Gender inequality and FDI: empirical evidence from developing
   Asia-Pacific countries
SO EURASIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The link between gender inequality and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries is also a contentious issue. Gender inequality is also considered to have a negative impact on economic development due to the constraints on the labor market and women's empowerment. This study aims to investigate the impact of gender inequality on the FDI inflow in developing countries. Our data consist of 27 developing economies in the Asia-Pacific region covering the period from 1992 to 2011. Employing the two steps system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), we find that gender equality plays an important role in attracting FDI flows into developing countries.

SO EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB The main aim of the study was to identify the image of gender equality in Polish primary school textbooks. A thematic analysis of textbook content with elements of constant comparison method was carried out based on the six domains of the Gender Equality Index: work, money, knowledge, time power, and health. A total of 56 textbooks (32 Polish language textbooks and workbooks and 24 mathematics textbooks and workbooks) for primary school grades seven and eight were analysed. The content of the analysed textbooks seems to reflect the findings of the Gender Equality Index (GEI) regarding the Polish social reality and points to large gender polarisation and gender inequalities, in favour of men. The results are discussed based on theories of cultural understanding of gender and gender roles, as well as similar findings from other educational content studies.

TI Gender Equality as a Closed Case: A Survey among the Members of the 2015
   Danish Parliament
SO SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Despite almost unanimous adherence to the principle of gender equality in contemporary Denmark, a society with a long historical record of gender equality policies and almost 40 percent women in parliament, are there still divergences to be found among the members of parliament concerning gender equality principles and policies? This article argues that in order to identify underlying cleavages it is necessary to pose fundamental questions that go beyond the day-to-day disagreements on policy issues. Based on a new survey of the members of the Danish parliament, this study finds that the support for gender equality is not just a matter of lip service insofar as few MPs hold traditionalist views on women. However, the study reveals conflicting perceptions, left-right cleavages and gender gaps, sometimes also within the parties. A new discourse is identified, supported by a large minority that includes all of the male MPs from the four right-wing parties; this minority considers gender equality to be a closed case' - that is, as having by and large been achieved. This may provide clues to the puzzle of the stagnation in gender equality reforms in spite of the general support for gender equality'. The article discusses the possible connection between the closed case' discourse, present neoliberal trends in society and the recent construction of gender equality as an intrinsic Danish value' - an argument familiar in other countries with a harsh debate over immigration.

TI Community understandings of and responses to gender equality and
   empowerment in Rakai, Uganda
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Women's rights and gender empowerment programmes are now part of the international agenda for improving global public health, the benefits of which are well documented. However, the public health community has, yet, to address how people define and understand gender equality and how they enact the process of empowerment in their lives. This study uses safe homes and respect for everyone (SHARE), an anti-violence intervention in rural Rakai, Uganda, as a case study to investigate perceptions of gender equality. Investigators analysed 12 focus groups of adult women and men to explore how macro-level concepts of gender equality are being processed on an interpersonal level and the effects on health outcomes. Respondents generally agreed that women lack basic rights. However, they also expressed widespread disagreement about the meanings of gender equality, and reported difficulties integrating the concepts of gender equality into their interpersonal relationships. Community members reported that equality, with the resulting shift in gender norms, could expose women to adverse consequences such as violence, infidelity and abandonment with increased sexual health risks, and potential adverse effects on education. Efforts to increase women's rights must occur in conjunction with community-based work on understandings of gender equality.

SO ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
AB The transition from premarital sexual relationships and courtship to marriage and parenthood in southeastern Nigeria involves particularly dramatic adjustments for young women who have absorbed changing ideas about sexuality, marriage, and gender equality, and who have had active premarital sexual lives. In the eyes of society, these women must transform from being promiscuous girls to good wives. This paper examines these adjustments and, specifically, how young married women's lives are affected by the reality of male infidelity and a persistent gendered double standard regarding the acceptability of extramarital sex.

TI The spatial distribution of gender differences in obesity prevalence
   differs from overall obesity prevalence among US adults
SO ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Purpose: Although obesity disparities between racial and socioeconomic groups have been well characterized, those based on gender and geography have not been as thoroughly documented. This study describes obesity prevalence by state, gender, and race and/or ethnicity to (1) characterize obesity gender inequality, (2) determine if the geographic distribution of inequality is spatially clustered, and (3) contrast the spatial clustering patterns of obesity gender inequality with overall obesity prevalence.
   Methods: Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to calculate state-specific obesity prevalence and gender inequality measures. Global and local Moran's indices were calculated to determine spatial autocorrelation.
   Results: Age-adjusted, state-specific obesity prevalence difference and ratio measures show spatial autocorrelation (z-score = 4.89, P-value <.001). Local Moran's indices indicate the spatial distributions of obesity prevalence and obesity gender inequalities are not the same. High and low values of obesity prevalence and gender inequalities cluster in different areas of the United States.
   Conclusions: Clustering of gender inequality suggests that spatial processes operating at the state level, such as occupational or physical activity policies or social norms, are involved in the etiology of the inequality and necessitate further attention to the determinates of obesity gender inequality.

AB The article is based on the research whose aim is to find out the attitudes of social workers toward gender equality. The qualitative research was carried out in 2014 in order to find out social workers' attitudes to gender equality in families and families at social risk, as well as obstacles and possibilities for implementation of gender equality in families at social risk. Eight social workers working with families at social risk were interviewed using semi-structured interview and content analysis for research data analysis. The research data reveals that gender equality in the family can be reached by mutual agreement, when the division of duties and responsibilities is in accordance with needs and abilities of family members. Good family relations are emphasized as a prerequisite for gender equality. Families at social risk with unbalanced social functioning and relationships are affected by stereotyped thinking about gender roles. As informants point out, this makes gender equality impossible in families at social risk. Social workers reveal that they do not directly relate the gender dimension with social work practice, and as a result it becomes problematic to promote gender equality in families at social risk. The main obstacles for implementation of gender equality are clients' resistance to change, too much responsibilities put on women-mother by social workers and other institutions that deal with social risk families, lack of information on gender equality and tools for promoting gender equality in the family. However, the informants provide solutions for promotion of gender equality in micro, mezzo and macro practice that correspond to the guidelines presented in the documents and strategies on gender equality at national and EU level.

TI Moving from problems to solutions: A review of gender equality
   interventions at work using an ecological systems approach
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR
AB Despite the mounting research on gender inequality in the workplace, progress toward gender parity in organizational practice has stalled. We suggest that one reason for the lack of progress is that empirical research has predominately focused on the antecedents and manifestations of gender inequality in the workplace, paying inadequate attention to the solutions that could potentially improve gender equality and women's experiences at work. Indeed, we report here that less than 5% of the relevant studies published in preeminent management, psychology, and diversity journals since the turn of the century identify practical interventions for solving gender inequality in organizations. To advance gender equality at work, we argue that a paradigm shift from problems to solutions is critical and urgent. Using ecological systems theory as our guiding framework, we present an integrative review of gender equality interventions spanning across the management, psychology, and feminist literature over the past two decades at the ontogenic system, interpersonal microsystem, and organizational microsystem levels of analysis. We subsequently provide an overview of domains not currently addressed in extant research (mesosystems, macrosystems, and chronosystems) and identify future research directions to spur progress toward workplace gender equality.

AB The achievement of gender equality is among the objectives of Uganda's Universal Primary Education program (UPE) that are yet to be realised. This research was carried out to understand the persistence of gender inequality in UPE in the context of HIV/AIDS. A key question addressed in this chapter is: Do primary school teachers have the necessary competencies to promote gender equality in the rural context of HIV/AIDS in Uganda? We conclude that there is a need to enhance teachers' competencies that are identified on the basis of this study. Enhancing and developing relevant teacher competencies could accelerate the achievement of gender equality in UPE and eventually re-shape the wider landscape within which HIV/AIDS operates.

TI Attitudes of Professionals in Serbia on Gender Equality and Gender-based
   Violence: The Research Results
SO TEMIDA
AB In 2019 the Victimology Society of Serbia conducted the survey aimed at assessing the attitudes of professionals who work in state institutions, independent state agencies and civil society organizations in Serbia about gender equality and gender-based violence, and collecting data on their experiences and challenges in dealing with gender-based violence victims, especially Roma women and women in rural areas. The survey was a part of the broader project aimed to contribute to policy and practice changes to ensure the recognition of harmful gender stereotypes and gender discrimination and to ensure suppression and timely response in cases of gender-based violence. It was a part of the program "Ending Violence against Women in the Western Balkan countries and Turkey: Implementing Norms, Changing Minds", implemented by the UN Women and funded by the European Commission. The survey was conducted on a sample of 199 respondents from the police, courts, prosecutors' offices, social welfare centres, independent institutions and civil society organizations, in 21 local communities in Serbia.
   The survey findings suggested that in general practitioners involved in the survey do not have negative attitudes towards gender equality and gender-based violence. However, when looking at some individual statements on the scales of attitudes on gender equality and gender-based violence, as well as answers to additional questions regarding the role of women and men at home, one can still conclude that traditional (gender) stereotypes are present in respondents of both sexes. The survey results also revealed a lack of knowledge about gender-based violence, which can result in the victim not being recognized, blaming the victim, failing to provide necessary assistance, support and protection, leading to re-victimization and secondary victimization. On average, male respondents have more conservative attitudes towards gender equality and gender-based violence than women. Older respondents, and consequently respondents with longer working experience, have more negative attitudes towards gender equality and gender-based violence than younger respondents. Respondents working in the judiciary, police and prosecution have more negative attitudes towards gender equality and gender-based violence than respondents from independent state bodies, centres for social work and civil society organizations. Attitudes on gender equality proved to be a strong predictor of attitudes about different forms of gender-based violence. Therefore, it is necessary to work further on raising awareness and strengthening capacities of practitioners in state institutions and civil society organizations on issues related to gender equality and gender-based violence, as well as on raising public awareness, including (potential) victims of gender inequality and gender-based violence, so that citizens can recognize their own or victimization of others and seek help and protect their rights.

TI Gender Equality Attitudes among Turks in Western Europe and Turkey: The
   Interrelated Impact of Migration and Parents' Attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES
AB This study applies unique data on three-generation migrant and non-migrant lineages to assess how assimilation and intergenerational transmission theories hold up for attitudes on gender equality in the context of Turkey-Europe migration. Information on migration histories of families and gender equality attitudes is collected for over 800 families. Based on those data assimilation and retention theories and theories on intergenerational transmission as a means to reproduce cultural attitudes among migrant families are tested from a dissimilation-from-origin perspective: how do migrants and their descendants differ from non-migrants from the same area of origin. The results of this study support concepts that focus on context- and path-dependency: segmented assimilation is shown in the form that the more traditional migrants who move back to Turkey have children with more traditional views than comparable people without migrant ancestors (retention). At the same time, among lineages that settle in Europe, migration seems to speed up the assimilation process of becoming more supportive of gender equality. Moreover, the youth that grew up in Europe is hardly influenced by the parents' attitudes, whereas the ones growing up in Turkey are. This supports the idea of migration being a transmission belt for intergenerational transmission.

TI Stories of Backlash in Interviews With Survivors of Intimate Partner
   Violence Against Women in Sweden
SO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AB Despite high gender equality ratings, Sweden shows a high prevalence of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). Suggested factors underlying this apparent paradox include backlash effects against women's empowerment. This study explores stories of backlash in interviews with 23 IPVAW survivors in Sweden. Thematic analysis identified categories of narrative segments referring to phenomena provoking violence; the victims' resources, agency, breaking with gender norms and resistance, and the partner's feelings of subordination, while case-centered narrative analysis pointed to divergences between how these categories appear in the stories. The study underscores the complexity of links between gender (in)equality and IPVAW in Sweden.

TI The invisible carers - Framing domestic work(ers) in gender equality
   policies in Spain
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB This article explores how paid domestic work is framed in state policies and discourses, drawing upon theoretical discussions on gender, welfare and global care chains. Based on a case study of the political debate on the 'reconciliation of personal, family and work life' in Spain, the author argues that dominant policy frames relate gender inequality to women's unpaid domestic work and care, while domestic workers are essentially the invisible 'other'. Empowering and disempowering frames are discussed; domestic workers are mainly constructed as a solution to the care problem and only marginally as subjects and rights-holders. The overall aim is to examine how public policies legitimize and (re)produce social inequalities related to gender, class and nationality.

TI Structural Gender Inequality and Mental Health among Chinese Men and
   Women
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION
AB Little is known about the association between structural gender inequality and health in patriarchal China. This study employed a sample from the Chinese Women's Social Status, consisting of 26,139 participants aged 18 and 70 years (13,494 women and 12,645 men). Structural gender inequality was assessed at the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. Mental health was measured by the summed scores of eight questions on depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression was applied for analysis. Results showed that total sex ratio at birth was associated with poorer mental health among women and men but sex ratio at birth of the second-born child predicted better mental health. Gender inequality at meso-level resulted in poorer mental health and gender inequality at microlevel was associated with poorer mental health both for men and women. Eliminating structural gender inequality promotes populations' mental health in China.

TI Gender equality in German universities: vernacularising the battle for
   the best brains
SO GENDER AND EDUCATION
AB We examine how global pressures for competitiveness and gender equality have merged into a discourse of 'inclusive excellence' in the twenty-first century and shaped three recent German higher education programmes. After placing these programmes in the larger discourse about gender inequalities, we focus on how they adapt current global concerns about both being 'the best' and increasing 'gender equality' in locally specific ways, a process called vernacularisation. German equality advocates used 'meeting international standards' as leverage, drew on self-governance norms among universities, used formal gender plans as mechanisms to direct change, and set up competition to legitimate intervention. This specific incremental policy path for increasing women's status in German universities also mobilised the national funding agency and local gender equality officers as key actors, and placed particular emphasis on family friendliness as the expression of organisational commitment to gender equality.

TI Spillovers from gender equality onto economic equality: Evidence from
   162 nations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper studies the influence of different aspects of gender equality or female empowerment on income inequality. A key question addressed is: Are there positive spillovers from gender equality to income equality? Using data drawn from 162 nations over the years 1985-2019, results show that nations with a long history of women's suffrage, greater representation of women in the government, lower fertility rates and better overall gender equality experienced lower income inequality, ceteris paribus. These results are largely supported in several robustness checks, including different model estimation strategies to address potential reverse-causality issues, considering alternative measures of income inequality, and considerations of persistence and nonlinearities in the gender inequality measures. The spillovers from some dimensions of gender equality are found to be sensitive to existing income inequality. Policymakers ignoring the payoffs from gender empowerment on income distribution might be underinvesting in initiatives to empower women.

TI GENDER EQUALITY IN THE ROMANIAN LOCAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
SO TRANSYLVANIAN REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Gender equality in public institutions is a sensitive topic considering the vast efforts of European countries to overcome the problems raised by gender inequality, gender segregation and gender discrimination in the labor market. In order to measure gender equality in public institutions and to identify the most important gender related organizational issues a questionnaire was built, tested in 2010 in one public institution, and then applied at national scale to public servants (both women and men) from local public institutions. The questionnaire focuses on gender stereotypes, sexual harassment, gender discrimination (in hiring, promotion, pay and benefits, evaluation, promotion and task distribution practices in institution) and occupational mobility.

SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Gender equality on boards is a global and highly politicized issue. To this day, there is considerable cross-country variation in female board representation. We examine institutional supply- and demand-side factors associated with this issue. Our results indicate that a societal climate of gender equality contributes to more women on boards, mainly through fostering the supply of suitable candidates. Therefore, the glass ceiling should be improved through a societal supply-side effort which needs to complement demand-side (quota) regulation.

TI Understanding, ownership, or resistance: Explaining persistent gender
   inequality in public services
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Gender inequality persists in the public services in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, despite decades of policy and strategic initiatives designed to promote greater equality. Resistance to gender equality, characterized by opposition to change or support for the status quo, has emerged as one potential explanation for the disconnection between policies and outcomes. This article explores whether concepts of resistance assist to explain slow progress towards gender equality in our study of four Australian public sector jurisdictions, where we asked middle managers about their understanding of, and action towards, gender equality. We found that managers were committed to gender equality and held a general understanding of their jurisdiction's gender equality policies, but lacked a deeper understanding of how organizations and human resource practice are gendered, which impeded translating commitment into action. This resulted in various levels of resistance and an unwillingness or inability to operationalize policies and strategies. This indicates that public services have progressed from identifying the problem to not knowing how to operationalize solutions. Our research contributes to the resistance literature, showing the existence of the various forms of gender equality resistance, which can impede action. A further contribution is that our research did not find differences between the approaches of male and female managers in gender-balanced organizations, with both equally aware of the policies but demonstrating similar levels and types of resistance.

AB Although a growing body of research emphasizes the role of women in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in developing countries, gender inequality is still persistent in the sector. The paper investigates whether ASM sector policies integrate gender equality principles of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, we analyze the implications of formalization policy and a ban on informal mining for the attainment of SDG 5 (Gender Equality) using a qualitative case study of informal gold mining in Ghana. In this study, we assess how these solutions to ASM governance engage with gender equality targets and women's participation in the governance functions using Salience and Institutional Analysis and Design (SIAD) framework. We highlight policy shortcomings with regards to internationally agreed targets on gender equality and draw recommendations for formalization policies in the ASM sector.

TI Institutional Change and Organisational Resistance to Gender Equality in
   Higher Education: An Irish Case Study
SO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Attempts to transform the gendered structures and cultures of higher education institutions have had limited success. This article focuses on one Irish university (pseudonym University A) where gender inequality was a major concern culminating in high-profile litigation. Using a feminist institutional approach, it asks: (1) What changes and interventions were introduced in the context of a favorable national policy environment and local grassroots support? and (2) how were these interventions perceived by staff? The methodology draws, firstly on the authors' personal knowledge of the local context; secondly, on an analysis of University A's key gender equality-related actions and documents; and thirdly, on a thematic analysis of qualitative data from 129 respondents in an online survey. Positive changes are identified, as is institutional resistance, reflected in low ambitions and focus on individualistic solutions. In the qualitative data, resistance involving denial; assertions that the problem is solved; the importance of meritocracy, and a focus on "fixing the women" (and the men) were identified. Acceptance of gender equality as an organisational issue was reflected in criticism of the interventions as tokenistic window dressing; not impacting on the culture and "not going far enough". The implications for effectively addressing gender inequality are discussed.

TI Loneliness and Emancipation: A Multilevel Analysis of the Connection
   between Gender Inequality, Loneliness, and Social Isolation in the ISSP
   2017
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The present article analyzes the connection between, on the one hand, gender equality and, on the other hand, loneliness and social isolation. It hypothesizes that modern relational institutions that support gender equality, such as no-fault divorce laws, reduce loneliness in close relationships. This hypothesis is put to the test through a multilevel analysis of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2017. The analysis reveals that the data agree, to a large extent, with the theoretical arguments. The prevalence of loneliness is higher in countries with higher levels of gender inequality (as measured by the Gender Inequality Index (GII)). This can be attributed to a moderation effect; at lower levels of gender inequality, partnerships provide better protection from loneliness. These results are robust to controls for demographic composition, level of health, educational attainment, income poverty, and interview mode. Last, the analyses show that the threat of emotional isolation is more widespread in countries with low gender inequality. These findings, however, are only significant before controlling for demographic composition, level of health, educational attainment, income poverty, and interview mode, and they require further analysis. The concluding section relates these findings to the popular tendency to argue that modern society has created a "loneliness epidemic" and discusses policy implications.

AB This paper describes the initial steps of a project developed with the aim of fostering diversity and the gender equality at the University of Minho, with a particular focus on the school of engineering. The project follows the action-research method, starting by gathering the perspectives of the various organizational participants (academics, non-academics, researchers, and students). The insights emerging from the collected information supported the definition and the prioritization of actions and activities of the Gender Equality Plan. Four levels of intervention were considered: Human Resources and Management Practices, Research Content and Delivery, Teaching and Students' Services and Institutional Communication, under the EQUAL-IST Project (Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions). The techniques used to gather the supporting information included interviews with decision makers, as well as focus groups with students, teachers, and academic staff at the School of Engineering. From the analysis of the gathered information emerged a set of challenges and opportunities to improve gender equality. The Gender Equality Plan (GEP) now being implemented at the university addresses the identified challenges and integrates actions to seize the opportunities to achieve greater gender equality. GEP was designed in line with 3 main goals: raise awareness, implement structural changes and engage stakeholders in mind-set change.

The reports for the entire period show that progress has been made in the situation for women through specific programs, but the results are always lower than expected. Thus, inequalities persist in several areas, and developments are the source of new challenges. The main objective of this article is to show how gender equality influences EU funded programs and what issues arise depending on the area in which it is applied. We intend to highlight the types of projects that have gender equality objectives and successful models, considering the context in which these projects were carried out and highlighting the determinants of their success. On the way to building a sustainable and inclusive Europe, gender equality encounter many obstacles, particularly in regions where the ideas of existence of disparities and imbalances are not accepted and documented.

After reviewing conceptual and methodological issues related to previous measures of structural inequality I detail the logic and methodology involved in the construction of a composite and multidimensional measure of gender equality, at the social structural or macrosystem, level in Mexico: GEIMS (Gender Equality Index in Mexican States). The importance of assessing the level of gender equality among Mexican states is of theoretical and practical relevance for understanding potential sources of regional differences regarding many social phenomena. The methodology can be also used to construct gender equality indexes in other Latin American countries.

This article refers to the results of an exploratory and descriptive bibliographical and field research, in which a questionnaire was directed to students of a public school in the city of Recife. According to the data obtained and duly analyzed, we realized that the conclusions pointed to the need to intensify the inclusion of actions that work on gender issues in the classroom, since we found few effective actions that seek to work on the theme.

Gender differences and inequalities have been identified in relation to causes and consequences of diabetes and access to services and support between women and men, and among different groups of women. Appropriate gender-sensitive policy responses, including research and data collection, need to be developed.

TI New times and new vocabularies: Theorising and evaluating gender
   equality in Commonwealth higher education
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB This article examines contrasting approaches to theorising and evaluating gender equality in higher education across the Commonwealth. The most common approach conceives gender equality as the inclusion of women in higher education. This perspective generally does not challenge the form of institutions, their power dynamics or epistemological frameworks. Critical approaches highlight gendered processes within institutions, often obscured by rhetoric and complex means of silencing. The capability approach of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, for example, explicitly advocates connections between aspirations for gender equality within higher education and wider social justice concerns. This approach requires a consideration of questions of gender equality within and beyond the institution pointing to the need for further work on a global ethics that deepens meanings of gender equality, higher education and Commonwealth.

TI Translations of Gender Equality among Rural Arsi Oromo in Ethiopia
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB How are global policies on women's rights and gender equality translated into local contexts and who are the translators in this process? This article describes and analyses contradictory and competing translations of gender equality in two districts in Ethiopia. Two main strands of translations are identified: gender experts' in the government's gender machinery emphasize the importance of changing the gendered division of labour while the grassroots' underscore the importance of collaborative work and mutual agreement through conjugal dialogue. Although these translations are similar in terms of their focus on labour, they represent fundamentally different visions of gender equality, the first reflecting a vision of equality as sameness, the latter ideals of gender complementarity. Rather than presenting one or both translations as examples of resistance against or misinterpretation of gender equality, I argue that contemporary theories of translation and discursively informed theories on global norm diffusion offer perspectives that allow us to recognize the potential of contestations in meaning creation. This opens up the translational space as the grassroots' are recognized as translators.

AB This introduction assesses the effects of Latin America's pink tide on gender equality in the region. We find that left governments and left competition provide an opportunity for advancing gender equality. However, the dominant pattern during Latin America's pink tide was one of a reactive left. Pink tide governments typically did not have clearly articulated gender equality initiatives on their immediate policy agendas. Instead, left governments mostly reacted to pressures from domestic gender equality activists. In addition to left ideology and feminist mobilization, left party type and policy type explain progress and setbacks in gender equality across six outcome areas.

TI Gender equality and immigrant integration: Honor killing and forced
   marriage debates in the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB The past decade has seen a surge in media and policy debates on honor-based violence, honor killing, and forced marriage in the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain. Drawing on political debates and policy responses to these forms of violence, we analyze how understandings of "gender equality" inform distinct approaches to immigrant integration. The Dutch case shows how the idea of gender equality can sometimes be used to include Muslim communities in the larger population, by generating policy responses that are more likely to position immigrants as full members of society. Alternatively, as the German case most clearly illustrates, the idea of gender equality can inform the stigmatization of Muslim communities and lead to exclusionary immigration policies. In Britain, gender equality discourses stand in tension with discourses on race, with some NGO's accusing government of failing women out of fear of being accused of racism. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gender structural changes processes in research institutions have been promoted by the EC in the last 2 decades through specific work programmes and supported by dedicated studies; one of the critical issues highlighted by the existing literature on the issue is related to the tensions and negotiations between the transformative goal of gender equality policies and the multiple ways they can be re-assumed and incorporated into existing policies and institutional goals contributing to small steps changes by exploiting existing discursive opportunities, or being overtly resisted and seen as destabilizing elements of the status quo and its power structures (Lombardo, Meier & Verloo, 2009; Kreissl, Striedinger, Sauer, & Hofbauer, 2015; Van den Brink & Benschop, 2012; Bacchi & Eveline, 2010). The H2020 EQUAL-IST (Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions) project supports 7 Universities across Europe starting from their Informatics and/or Information Systems Departments to initiate the design and implementation of gender equality plans from a field such as ICT/IST featured by extremely low representation of female researchers and full professors. The paper analyzes the assessment and the preliminary steps of the initiated design process: based on a mixed methodology and a participatory approach to design of gender equality policies, quantitative data collection has gone hand in hand with a qualitative element from Participatory Gender Audit: staff members and students discussed the main challenges related to gender inequalities and an idea generation process was kicked off. Analysing the emerging challenges and proposed solutions we'll highlight some discrepancies between 'diagnostic' assessment of problems and 'prognostic' ideas for measures that lead to interesting insights as far as the afore-mentioned tensions are concerned.

TI Association of source country gender inequality with experiencing
   assault and poor mental health among young female immigrants to Ontario,
   Canada
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Gender inequality varies across countries and is associated with poor outcomes including violence against women and depression. Little is known about the relationship of source county gender inequality and poor health outcomes in female immigrants.
   Methods: We used administrative databases to conduct a cohort study of 299,228 female immigrants ages 6-29 years becoming permanent residence in Ontario, Canada between 2003 and 2017 and followed up to March 31, 2020 for severe presentations of suffering assault, and selected mental health disorders (mood or anxiety, self-harm) as measured by hospital visits or death. Poisson regression examined the influence of source-country Gender Inequality Index (GII) quartile (Q) accounting for individual and country level characteristics.
   Results: Immigrants from countries with the highest gender inequality (GII Q4) accounted for 40% of the sample, of whom 83% were from South Asia (SA) or Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The overall rate of assault was 10.9/10,000 person years (PY) while the rate of the poor mental health outcome was 77.5/10,000 PY. Both GII Q2 (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR): 1.48, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.08, 2.01) and GII Q4 (IRR: 1.58, 95%CI: 1.08, 2.31) were significantly associated with experiencing assault but not with poor mental health. For females from countries with the highest gender inequality, there were significant regional differences in rates of assault, with SSA migrants experiencing high rates compared with those from SA. Relative to economic immigrants, refugees were at increased risk of sustaining assaults (IRR: 2.96, 95%CI: 2.32, 3.76) and poor mental health (IRR: 1.73, 95%CI: 1.50, 2.01). Higher educational attainment (bachelor's degree or higher) at immigration was protective (assaults IRR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.51, 0.80; poor mental health IRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.80).
   Conclusion: Source country gender inequality is not consistently associated with post-migration violence against women or severe depression, anxiety and self-harm in Ontario, Canada. Community-based research and intervention to address the documented socio-demographic disparities in outcomes of female immigrants is needed.

TI Should governments in Europe be more aggressive in pushing for gender
   equality to raise fertility? The second "NO"
SO DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
AB This paper argues against the suggestion that governments should push for gender equality more aggressively in order to raise fertility. The paper presents a threefold "no" to this proposal. It takes issue with the goal of raising fertility, arguing that the claims that fertility must be increased are based on myths. It rejects a more aggressive pursuit of gender equality for demographic purposes, maintaining that this method preserves inequality. It warns against using gender equality for fertility purposes, stating that this narrows the realm of gender equality.
   The paper is based on a debate held at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, at which the author was asked to argue against the gender equality-fertility proposal. The other participants in the debate were Laurent Toulemon ("yes"), Dimiter Philipov ("no"), and Livia Olah ("yes").

SO JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
AB Aim: The study explores whether, and how, gender equality is associated with key aspects related to operative managers' improvement work. We explore the possible associations between gender equality and; prioritization of social regulations in operative decision-making, engagement in operative improvement work, group dynamics challenges and collaboration between managers and subordinates.
   Background: Regarding organizational relations and preconditions for providing good care and developing operative work in the social and elderly care sector, the value of having organizational gender equality is unknown.
   Method: Associations were analysed using structural equation modelling of questionnaire data. The questionnaire was distributed to first-line managers in a large city in Sweden (n = 598, response rate 56%).
   Results: Positive perceptions of organizations' gender equality were significantly associated with more engagement in operative improvement work, fewer group dynamics challenges and higher priority of social regulations in unit decision-making, also when controlling for confounders. Gender equality had no association with managers' collaboration with subordinates in this study.
   Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that equal opportunities for male and female workers could benefit operative managers' improvement work.
   Implications for Nursing Management: Organizations that strive to improve conditions for operative work, which strengthen preconditions for service development, should include values of gender equality.

TI Western Gender Policies in Afghanistan: Failing Women and Provoking Men
SO GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB Gender identities and politics have always been entangled with geopolitics in Afghanistan. Since 2001, when North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces ousted the Taliban government, a great deal of research on gender issues and the status of women has been done in Afghanistan. There is, however, a lack of research on how Afghan men themselves view these efforts to promote gender equality and women's rights. Based on my primary research in Kabul around Afghan masculinity, I found that the efforts of the international community to promote gender equality and improve the conditions of women in Afghanistan have not worked. On the contrary, they have provoked even educated Afghan men into taking up more defensive and conservative positions, instead of convincing them that women deserve equal rights. I demonstrate that gender training since October 2001 has been geopolitical, economic, and social, employing Western notions of gender equality to Afghanistan with scant regard for their relevance in an economy of scarce jobs. This cultural insensitivity exhibited by the international community has contributed to the general disdain for gender equality and women's rights among most Afghan men in Kabul.

TI Green houses for terrorism: measuring the impact of gender equality

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND APPLIED CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB Recent research suggests that there are links between terrorism and gender inequality. This study is a cross-national times series estimation for 57 countries for the period 1994-2002 to examine the impact of attitudes and actual outcomes of gender equality on levels of terrorism experienced by a country using World Values Survey and Global Terrorism Database. The results suggest that actual outcomes of gender equality have a significant and consistently negative impact on terrorism. Women's actual advancement and equality in higher education, jobs and political representation are more effective in reducing terrorism than cultural attitudes supporting these rights. Additionally, comparing attitudes and outcomes of gender equality in a country, I find there is a gap between the two. This study has important public policy implications for focusing on greater levels of social, economic, and political gender equality for reducing the levels of terrorism.

SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB While existing research offers an understanding of the antecedents, forms, and consequences of resistance to gender equality work in organizations, studies primarily regard resistance as a challenge to be overcome or as something that can at times be beneficial for change. In this paper, we argue that resistance shapes gender equality work. We focus on covert forms of resistance and give voice to experts in Finland and Sweden who work for gender equality in organizations. Analyzing the discursive politics involved in (de)legitimizing and (de)politicizing equality work, we elucidate how experts deal with resistance by shaping the meaning of equality and working for it. Our findings suggest that covert resistance undermines the quest for gender equality by molding the conditions for how equality work can be done, thus influencing what it can achieve in organizations and in society.

AB This article analyzes the efforts of Egyptian feminist activists to insert gender equality in the country's post-revolutionary constitutions in 2012 and 2014. While the literature on women's political role during this period provides insights into exclusionary gender practices and conditions for bargaining power structures, this study contributes with a conceptual analysis of how feminist activists construed constitutional gender equality. The study is based on interviews with, and written statements by, activists engaged in the constitutional process. The article argues that these activists viewed the constitution as a central instrument in the struggle for gender equality and demanded a gender equality model beyond the sameness/difference paradigm. Instead, they argued for a substantive notion of gender equality that reflected women's situated experiences while they, at the same time, navigated the legacies of Egypt's earlier constitutions.

   Taboos'?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB Discursive dynamics play an important role in shaping the meanings of gender equality. The article discusses the relation between hegemonic discourses on gender equality policies and feminist taboos. It suggests that feminist scholars could paradoxically be trapped in hegemonic discourses on gender equality policies that may lead to taboos about particular approaches to and interpretations of such policies. Three main feminist hegemonic discourses are considered to act as taboos. They deal with the possibility to overcome patriarchy, the role of elites and other groups of actors in processes of gender transformation and the merits of incremental change. The article further discusses the implications of the postulate about hegemonic discourses and taboos on gender equality for feminist knowledge production and reflects on the potential of Bacchi's notion of 'reflexivity' to overcome them.

This article analyzes three initiatives for providing a gender dimension to aid effectiveness developed by gender equality advocates following the signing of the declaration, and their proposed gender-sensitive indicators and approaches to engendering aid effectiveness. The analysis will consider the ways in which gender equality measurement is resisted and transformed within each initiative and what is subsequently made known about gender equality through the categories and tools developed.

TI Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Spain: Are There Gender
   Inequalities?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB It is well known that women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression and to consume antidepressants. The factors related to the medicalisation of depression and their social distribution remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse gender inequalities in the medicalisation of depression from an intersectional perspective. This was a cross-sectional study based on data from the European Health Survey relating to Spain. Gender inequalities were calculated using prevalence ratios of women compared to men with a diagnosis of depression and antidepressant use, adjusted for age, depressive symptoms, primary care visits and diagnosis of depression in the case of antidepressant use. After adjustments, the diagnosis of depression and the use of antidepressants were more prevalent in women, especially of lower socioeconomic levels. Gender inequalities in the diagnosis of depression also increased with decreasing level of education. Regarding the use of antidepressants, gender inequalities were not significant in university graduates and people of higher social. The gender inequalities found in the diagnosis and treatment of depression cannot be completely attributed to a higher level of depressive symptoms in women or their greater frequency of visits to primary care. Inequalities are greater in more vulnerable social groups.

   Case of Climate Change
SO HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENT: LEGAL PERSPECTIVES FROM AND FOR ETHIOPIA
SE International Studies in Human Rights
AB This paper seeks to draw attention to the linkages between gender equality, women's rights, and climate change by exploring its international legal and policy dimension. To this end, the paper describes how these linkages have been addressed both within the international climate change regime and the international human rights regime. The analysis shows that both regimes have recognized, to a certain extent, the importance of integrating a gender and human rights perspective into efforts to tackle climate change. However, so far, attempts to integrate both perspectives have taken a parallel rather than an integrated approach. Therefore, the author highlights the need for a gender-responsive human rights-based approach to climate change.

TI Gender inequality in multidimensional welfare deprivation in West Africa
   The case of Burkina Faso and Togo
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - The importance of gender equality is reflected not only in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but also in the World Bank's Gender Action Plan launched in 2007 as well as in other treaties and actions undertaken at regional and international levels. Unlike other gender poverty works, which are mostly based on monetary measurement, the purpose of this paper is to adopt a non-monetary approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present study makes use of a counting approach to examine gender issues in Burkina Faso and Togo using household surveys, namely Enquete Integrale surles Conditions de Vie des Menages (2009/2010) and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (2011), respectively. It focusses on six dimensions (housing, basic utilities, assets, education, employment and access to credit) largely recognized as MDG targets.
   Findings - Main findings indicate that overall individuals are the most deprived in education in Burkina Faso, while the reverse situation is true in Togo. Gender inequality is observed in all dimensions since women always seem to be more deprived than men. The situation is also marked by regional disparities. Moreover, the assessment of dimensional contributions shows different patterns for each country. While employment proves to be the main contributor of gender inequality in Burkina Faso, three dimensions (assets, access to credit and employment) account together for most of the total contribution to gender inequality in Togo.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of the paper is to use a multidimensional method (counting approach) to assess gender deprivation, with countries comparison. It also proposes an interesting combination of the decomposition by dimension with the subgroup's decomposition in order to determine the largest contributor to gender inequality.

TI Adolescent Relationship Aggression Perpetration and Victimization in the
   Context of Neighborhood Gender Equality
SO VIOLENCE AND GENDER
AB Adolescent relationship aggression (ARA) is a serious and common public health problem with many associated adverse health outcomes. Research on risk factors for ARA and resulting programmatic efforts to address the issue have focused primarily on individual-level characteristics, and less so on broader macro-level factors. The present study investigates the longitudinal relationship between one macro-level factor-neighborhood gender equality-and the prevalence of ARA perpetration and victimization among 723 participants (351 males and 372 females) of the Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence across two waves (2013 and 2016). Controlling for individual demographic characteristics and residential stability, the authors found that male participants living in neighborhoods with higher gender equality were less likely to report perpetrating ARA (beta = -0.56; p < 0.05). The authors did not detect associations between neighborhood gender equality and perpetration for female participants nor did the authors detect associations between neighborhood gender equality and victimization for either male or female participants. Their findings suggest that ARA perpetration by males is among the myriad of negative impacts of gender inequality and that efforts to address structural gender inequality may also lead to healthier, violence-free intimate relationships among adolescents. The authors discuss suggestions for further research.

TI How 'Empowerment' May Miss Its Mark: Gender Equality Policies and How
   They are Understood in Women's NGOs
SO VOLUNTAS
AB Women's NGOs are key players in the struggle to gain gender equality around the world. Motivated by a concern about the lack of progress in achieving gender equality on a global scale, the purpose of the study was to investigate the agendas and conceptualizations of women's NGOs for gaining gender equality, and to find out to what extent they identified with feminist strategies for social change. This paper is focused on the intersection of how women's NGOs conceptualise and deliver action towards gender equality and why gender inequality is still a major global social problem. The key mechanism for inquiry in this paper is the interrogation of how the concept of 'empowerment' in contemporary gender equality policies and programs, which are largely carried out by women's NGOs, has emerged as a possible counter force to achieving gender equality. Given that 'empowerment' frames contemporary gender equality policy at all levels of governance (local, national and global), the study explored its impact on the progress of achieving gender equality from the women's NGO perspective. The survey data revealed tensions between the wide range of feminist agendas of the NGOs and the limitations of the current empowerment paradigm. These tensions are between predominantly individualised empowerment processes and the much broader structural and other feminist objectives of how the NGOs understood gender equality as a concept and about how it could be achieved in practice.

SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB The European Union's regional policy, one of the world's largest public policies, promotes project activities funded by the Structural Funds, including the European Social Fund (ESF). Besides the goals of increased employment, competitiveness and growth, the ESF aims to increase gender equality (GE). GE is implemented in the ESF through administrative processes in national and regional institutions. Despite public administration's central role in defining and organizing the GE policy, administrative variations have received little attention. Drawing on interviews and policy documents, this study analyses differences in Sweden and Spain to explore the ideological consequences of governance structures for GE policies.

TI Gender Inequality in Interaction - An Evolutionary Account
SO SOCIAL FORCES
AB In this article I argue that evolutionary theorizing can help sociologists and feminists better understand gender inequality. Evolutionary theory explains why control of the sexuality of young women is a priority across most human societies both past and present. Evolutionary psychology has extended our understanding of male violence against women. Here I add to these theories and present asexual selection argument to postulate possible evolved predispositions that promote young female deference to adult males in interaction and the converse, lack of male deference to young females. According to this argument, the pattern of greater female deference disappears when the women involved are past menopause. Put together, these ideas form an evolutionary account of gender inequality that complements and extends traditional sociological and feminist theories.

   DEVELOPMENT
SO BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS ENGINEERING
AB Purpose - The article aims at discovering classes and clusters of EU member-states considering their levels of economic development and gender equality to foster the enhancement of EU cohesion policy.
   Research methodology - The methodology includes the grouping by two parameters, economic development and gender equality', and the cluster analysis, the "far neighbor principle", agglomerative hierarchical classification algorithm and the usual Euclidean distance as the distance between objects.
   Findings - There are no gender equality laggards among EU member-states. More developed countries belong to gender equality leaders, while there are two gender equality leaders and one gender equality adopter among transition countries. The group of less developed countries consists of six gender equality leaders and seven gender equality adopters.
   Research limitations - The results of cluster analysis may be impacted by off-shore activity of Ireland and Luxembourg.
   Practical implications - The EU supranational bodies can use our results to develop more efficient cohesion policy tools to ensure the adherence to the principle of gender equality.
   Originality/Value - The study is a pioneer one in determining nine classes and five clusters of EU member-states considering their levels of economic development and gender equality, as well as in introducing three types of countries depending on their level of gender equality, namely gender equality leaders, adopters, and laggards.

TI An Analysis of Citizenship and Democracy Education Text Book in the
   Context of Gender Equality and Determining Students' Perceptions on
   Gender Equality
SO KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI
AB Gender equality has been explained as both the equal treatment of women and men before the law and women's and men's equal usage of resources, opportunities, and services within the family and society. Today, although the conditions that support gender inequality have relatively decreased, gender discrimination still persists. Gender equality is expected to be taught by means of education at all levels and through curricula since they are the most important and indispensable elements of education. The first aim of this study is to determine whether an activity in the unit titled Towards Equality within the textbook, Citizenship and Democracy Education used in Turkey is appropriate for use in teaching gender equality. The second aim of the study is to determine through this activity students' views on gender equality/inequality and the reasons behind them based on the gender of students and the socio-economic levels of the schools which they attend. This is a descriptive study using both qualitative and quantitative research models. The study group consisted of a total of 160 students in 8th grade from four primary education schools from the lower, middle, and upper socio-economic levels (SEL) (three public schools, and one private school) in inner-city Ankara, Turkey. While descriptive statistical techniques (f-%) were used to analyze the quantitative data, content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. According to the findings of the study, the activity selected for testing by the researchers was found not to be adequate in strengthening gender equality awareness. Students generally attributed daily household chores and certain characteristics in the activity, which included such tasks as setting the table, being emotional, being a nurse, playing volleyball, and having blonde hair, to women. On the other hand, being a judge, playing football, and bravery were expressed as characteristics more likely to be specific to men. The ratios of these types of gender inequality based views were found to be higher particularly at the lower socio-economic level. The fact that gender inequality still continues in curriculum, course materials, and in the minds and behaviors of students makes it difficult to change this situation into a positive one. The content found in the curriculum and printed materials that are in connection with the curriculum should be cleared from implicit and explicit discourse that create or support gender inequality. Awareness of teachers about the variables that cause gender inequality should be increased.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This paper investigates the potential and actual contribution of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to gender equality in a framework of gender mainstreaming (GM). It introduces GM as combining technical systems (monitoring, reporting, evaluating) with political processes (women's participation in decision-making) and considers the ways in which this is compatible with CSR agendas. It examines the inclusion of gender equality criteria within three related CSR tools: human capital management (HCM) reporting, CSR reporting guidelines, and socially responsible investment (SRI) criteria on employee and diversity issues. Although evidence is found of gender equality information being requested within several CSR related reporting frameworks, these requirements are mostly limited in scope, or remain optional elements. The nature and extent of relevant stakeholder opportunities are investigated to explain this unfulfilled potential.

With few exceptions, gender inequality in labor force participation, work hours, occupational segregation, and housework are less severe as education goes up in all three countries, with the root cause being the high employment levels of well-educated women. Despite a common pattern across nations, we note that the educational gradient on gender equality in employment is weaker in Sweden. De-familialization policies in Sweden no doubt increase gender equality at the bottom by pulling less-educated women into the work force. One form of gender equality, wages, however, does not increase with education. In the United States, educational differences in the gender gap in wages are trivial; in Sweden and the Netherlands, the gender wage gap is greatest for the highly educated because of higher returns to education for men than women in these nations.

TI The Polish Variant of Patriarchy? Explaining the Relationship Between
   Gender Inequality and Violence Against Women in Poland
SO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AB The largest European victimization survey of violence against women (VAW), has revealed an interesting paradox: countries with the highest gender equality indices had the highest VAW indices, while countries with low gender equality, also had low VAW indices. The country with the lowest VAW rates was Poland. This article attempts to explain this paradox. First, the results of the FRA study regarding Poland and its methodological issues are described. As these explanations may prove insufficient, it is necessary to recourse to sociological theories of VAW, together with analyses of the sociocultural roles of women, and gender relations since the communist period (1945-1989). The key question is whether the Polish variant of the patriarchy is more respectful toward women than Western European gender equality.

TI Climate change adaptation, gender, and mainstreaming: the role of gender
   in Fiji's relocation initiative
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Climate change has elucidated already existing gender inequalities associated with unequal access to resources, decision-making processes, and higher exposure to environmental shocks and stressors. Growing acknowledgment of the gender-differentiated implications of climate change in recent years has placed gender equality as a focal point in international discourses on climate change adaptation. The policy perspective of gender equality is universalized, but how it transcribes in local climate change adaptation projects remains elusive. Using the relocation of Vunidogoloa, Fiji, this article explores the tension and compatibility between the way gender equality is discussed and how it is implemented in climate change adaptation projects.

   Romania
SO HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW
AB The idea of gender equality has been and still is an exogenous concept in Romanian culture. Initially introduced and institutionalized by communist ideology after World War II along with other utopian egalitarian principles, gender equality remains to this day a somewhat alien concept in practice for the majority of the Romanian population. Nevertheless, in the early twenty- first century, with renewed economic growth and more liberal governance in Romania, the gender equality debate has intensified, and multiple advocacies now compete on the political and social arenas. The most notable actors shaping current attitudes toward women in Romania are the Orthodox Church, political parties, feminist organizations, and the media.

TI From municipal feminism to the Equality Act - Legislation and gender
   equality work in UK local government 1980-2010
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB For decades local government has been an important site for the development of gender equality practice, and the implementation of legislation attempting to address inequality in the UK. The rise of 'municipal feminism' during the 1980s marked a particular instantiation. of gender equality work. Yet at the time the relationship between this phenomena and legislation was not given significant attention. The Equality Acts of 2006 and 2010 have been key milestones for local government gender equality work subsequently, yet little work has considered the detail of their implementation at the ground level by council employees. This article contributes to addressing this gap by examining the influence of legislation on local government gender equality practice at this level, and how this has changed over three decades. It draws on findings from a comparative historical study of three sites within the UK.

TI Evaluation of a masculinity and gender equality intervention for primary

SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY IN AFRICA
AB Interventions to promote gender equality with children should focus on constructive perceptions of masculinity. This study aimed to evaluate a brief intervention to promote constructive gender perspectives among South African primary school boys. Participants were Grade five boys attending 10 primary schools (n = 549, black = 100%; age range: 10-12). They completed the 12-session Hero Empathy Programme in two phases over a two-year period at their schools. They completed measures on gender perceptions, self-esteem, and family relationships pre- and post-intervention. In addition, a sub-sample of the boys (n = 100) participated in focus group discussions. The results following t-test analyses of the quantitative data indicated the boys to have significantly more egalitarian gender perceptions after the first phase of the intervention, but not after the second phase. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data indicated the boys to question gender stereotypes, respect girls more, and to not endorse abuse of girls. The findings suggest that a brief masculinity and gender equality intervention would be effective for young schoolboys exploring their gender identities.

TI Racial and ethnic variations in gender-related attitudes
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY
AB Research on how gender-related attitudes vary across racial/ethnic groups has produced contradictory results, depending upon the type of attitudes addressed. In this chapter, I review the literature on racial and ethnic variations in three broadly defined types of gender attitudes: attitudes toward gender roles; beliefs about the origins and extent of gender inequality; and preferences for social action to reduce gender inequalities. I address three racial/ethnic groups in the United States: African Americans, whites, and Hispanic Americans. While research on attitudes toward gender roles has yielded mixed results, research addressing attitudes within the other two domains clearly indicates greater criticism of gender inequality among African Americans relative to whites; research on the various groups often combined under the label Hispanic is too limited to draw any clear conclusions. Along with addressing variations across these three types of gender-related attitudes, I also summarize several other patterns evident in the literature: convergence across groups over time; gender gaps in gender-related attitudes; and differential predictors of gender attitudes across racial/ethnic groups.

TI When does women's political power matter? Women's representation and
   legal gender equality of economic opportunity across contexts
SO EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB This article explores how women's descriptive representation affects legal gender equality of economic opportunity. Building on existing studies on women's descriptive and substantive representation, we argue that as the proportion of female legislators and ministers increases, legal gender equality of economic opportunity improves. Additionally, we expect that a country's institutional context significantly shapes the influence of women in different positions of power on legal gender equality. The higher the legislature's law-making power, the greater the effect of female legislators on legal gender equality; under the same condition, its relative influence compared to female cabinet ministers is also greater. Similarly, we hypothesize that the higher the level of democracy, the more effective female legislators compared to female ministers. To test these arguments, we draw on the database that provides cross-national information on legal discrimination against women in economic opportunities and provide supporting evidence for our arguments.

TI Gender equality and the sex differential in mortality from accidents in
   high income nations
SO POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW
AB Despite their neglect by researchers relative to other causes of death, motor vehicle and other accidents contribute substantially to sex differences in mortality and address theoretical debates over the consequences of gender equality. A reduction-in-protection hypothesis argues that gender equality reduces the female advantage in accident mortality, a reduction-in-inequality hypothesis argues that gender equality increases the advantage, and an institutional adjustment hypothesis argues that gender equality initially reduces and then increases the advantage. The analysis tests these hypotheses using data on age-specific male and female accident mortality rates and indicators of work and family status for 18 high income nations from 1955-1994. In support of the institutional adjustment hypothesis, declining differentials in male and female motor vehicle and other accident mortality rates level off and sometimes increase in recent years, and measures of work and family change generally have similar curvilinear influences on the differential. Across nations, gender equality speeds the reversal in the differential for motor vehicle accidents, but not for other accidents.

TI Female senior managers and the gender equality environment: Evidence
   from south Korean firms
SO PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB This study investigates whether the presence of women at the senior management level improves the gender equality environment in South Korea. I find strong empirical support for the propo-sition that when the proportion of female senior managers is large, the gender gap in terms of salary and employment decreases. Furthermore, I empirically show that once the glass ceiling is cracked at the senior management level, female managers are more likely to sit at the top level of corporate management. This is suggested as the mechanism underlying the impact of the presence of female senior managers on the gender equality environment. Finally, I document that female senior managers indirectly enhance firm performance through an improved gender equality environment, while they also directly improve firm performance.

On one hand, the journalists I interviewed claimed they had reported on diverse social issues related to gender equality and feminism throughout their careers. On the other hand, they embraced the idea that the journalistic profession had achieved more gender equality in Finland than in other countries in the Global North and the Nordic region. Using narratives collected from 31 women journalists, I use this contradiction to problematise the relationship between experiences of gender equality and the desire to struggle for feminist demands in professional journalism. I do so by adopting the analytical approach of moderate feminism.

TI Gender gap and access to finance: A cross-country analysis
SO REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Using a rich firm-level data set pertaining to 80 countries, this paper investigates the relationship between institutional gender equality and financial constraints on female-led firms. We employ a broad index of gender inequality as well as alternate measures in terms of economic, educational, and political inequality. We observe that institutional gender equality benefits female entrepreneurs' access to finance. In addition, in a gender-equal environment, we observe that female-owned and female-managed firms are less likely to be discouraged from applying for formal finance. We find these effects are more pronounced in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and young firms. Further, our results suggest that economic, educational, and political gender equality is vital to improving women enterprises' access to external finance.

TI Macro-level gender equality and depression in men and women in Europe
SO SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS
AB A recurrent finding in international literature is a greater prevalence of depression in women than in men. While explanations for this gender gap have been studied extensively at the individual level, few researchers have studied macro-level determinants of depression in men and women. In the current study we aim to examine the micro-macro linkage of the relationship between gender equality and depression by gender in Europe, using data from the European Social Survey, 2006-2007 (N=39,891). Using a multilevel framework we find that a high degree of macro-level gender equality is related to lower levels of depression in both women and men. It is also related to a smaller gender difference in depression, but only for certain social subgroups and only for specific dimensions of gender equality.

AB The article analyses attitudes of European citizens towards gender equality. It describes how the EU script on gender relations emphasizes gender equality. Subsequently, the article analyses the extent to which citizens of different European countries agree with this idea, based on Eurobarometer data. The analyses show a strong overall support for gender equality in the economic, political, and educational realms, but also differences between countries. In explaining these differences, we go beyond other studies not only by concentrating on endogenous characteristics of the analysed countries, but also by taking into account their levels of modernization, institutionalized gender regimes, and religious composition. Moreover, following neo-institutionalist theory, we include an exogenous variable - the influence of the EU - in multi-level analyses and can show that, in addition to all endogenous variables, it also has an effect on attitudes towards gender relations.

SO POLITICS & GENDER
AB This article develops an analytical framework to study the power struggles between status quo and gender equality actors underpinning the implementation of gender equality policies. While resistance to gender equality policies in different institutions has received considerable scholarly attention, examining this struggle in light of a multifaceted concept of power that encompasses both domination and individual and collective empowerment, we argue, offers a more accurate account of the possibilities of a feminist politics of implementation. Our analytical framework also accounts for the factors that enable resistance by dominant actors and counter-resistance by gender equality actors and the informal rules that are being upheld or challenged, respectively. Applying our framework to the study of Spanish universities, we identify both the forms and types of resistance that hinder gender reform efforts in higher education institutions and the counter-action strategies that seek to drive implementation forward and achieve institutional change.

TI THE FIRST-DAUGHTER EFFECT THE IMPACT OF FATHERING DAUGHTERS ON MEN'S
   PREFERENCES FOR GENDER-EQUALITY POLICIES
SO PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY
AB An extensive literature on the politics of the family suggests that familial relationships play a central role in individuals' political socialization and can ultimately shape one's policy preferences. A current debate within this literature deals with the impact of daughters on fathers' political attitudes. In this article, we address this debate in relation to a specific set of policy preferences and ask: Does the experience of fathering daughters affect men's opinions toward gender-equality policies? In addressing this question, this study examines three theoretically motivated propositions: first, that having a daughter leads men to see the benefits of and support public policies that aim to reduce gender inequality; second, that fathers with a larger proportion of daughters express stronger support for these policies; and finally, that having a daughter as a man's first child is a critical event in the political socialization of men, such that this experience of "first-daughterhood" will lead to higher levels of support for gender-equality policies. We use original representative survey data from a module on the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to test these three hypotheses. The results of our analyses suggest that the experience of having a daughter as a first child-but not the effect of having a daughter in general nor the experience of fathering a higher proportion of daughters-significantly increases fathers' support for policies designed to increase gender equality.

TI Beyond methodological nationalism in explanations of gender equality:
   The impact of EU policies on gender provisions in national collective
   agreements in Belgium (1957-2020)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB Based on an analysis of gender equality provisions in national collective agreements, this article investigates the influence of European Union (EU) gender and macro-economic policy on gender equality outcomes in Belgium since the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. We show that, over time, EU gender equality policies have led to the adoption of provisions promoting formal gender equality and the integration of women in the labour market. At the same time, EU macro-economic policies have stimulated labour flexibility, promoting part-time work largely filled by women, and imposed wage moderation, which has fundamentally hampered the correction of historical indirect gender discrimination in wages. Overall, EU policies have stimulated the transformation of the conservative male breadwinner model of this coordinated market economy (CME) into a gendered 'one-and-a-half earner' model, a transformation partially enforced through the increased interference of the state transposing EU policies. Our study advances the current literature by pointing to the limitations of prevalent methodologically nationalist explanations of gender equality outcomes in CMEs. More specifically, it shows that the gender equality provisions of national collective bargaining agreements in CMEs cannot be understood independent of EU gender and macro-economic policies.

TI Gender discourses in an NGO education project: Openings for
   transformation toward gender equality in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB This article seeks to illustrate how various actors participating in a non-governmental organization (NGO) education project in two Bangladeshi communities represent different framings of gender. Teachers, as critical actors in this education project, utilize multiple discourses of gender equality and when viewed in relation to community members', parents' and students' ideas of gender equality, we argue their discursive practices can create spaces for transformation. The use of multiple discourses suggests that specific local adaptations of women in development (WID), gender and development (GAD), post-structural and rights and capabilities approaches may all be useful in the work toward gender justice as these approaches inform the different meanings of gender equality in the communities. We conclude that NGOs play a critical role in making micro-level changes in schools as well as have a broader impact on communities and national agendas by engaging different actors' uses of gender equality discourses.

TI The Effect of Gender Inequality in Education on Health: Evidence from
   Turkey
SO KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI
AB One of the main variables affecting the level of human capital positively is the improvements in health. The reduction in infant and under-five mortality rates and increase in life expectancy at birth are the basic indicators of improvements in health. One of the major sources of improvements in these variables is education. Theoretical literature by using various indicators shows that there is a long-term relationship between education and health levels. In this paper gender inequality in education has been used as an indicator of education. For, gender inequality in education has a potential strong effect on infant and under-five mortality rates. This paper deals with the relationship between gender inequality in education and health indicators especially for Turkey. The annual data for 1968-2006 periods were tested by Johansen Cointegration method. According to the result of empirical analysis, the effect of gender inequality in education on health is positive in the long run.

TI Gender Equality and De-Democratization Processes: The Case of Spain
SO POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE
AB Democracy is an ally of the feminist project and a necessary condition for its success. The European post-crisis context shows evidence of de-democratization processes that represent a remarkable challenge. This article investigates gender equality and processes of de-democratization in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. It argues that neoliberalism, authoritarian shifts, and political corruption are three key dimensions of the processes of de-democratization in Spain that contribute to oppose gender equality. However, political contestation and feminist collective agency both in movements and institutions have played a key role in counteracting these dynamics. Civil society and feminist movements' struggles for democracy, equality and social justice, the role of new populist left parties in channeling some of the protesters' demands, gender equality institutions keeping gender on the agenda despite austerity cuts, and new local governments emerging from civic platforms after the 2015 elections have been effective in resisting attacks to Spanish democracy. A thorough revision of academic literature and other secondary sources helps to capture the specificities of this complex political setting.

TI Advancing Gender Equality Without Forfeiting Religious Autonomy:

SO REVIEW OF FAITH & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB This paper aims to understand the reasons why religious freedom and gender equality often appear to be competing values. The clash is observable in OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) countries, which are home to a variety of cultural and religious traditions. No progress toward greater social peace and harmony can be made as long as there are groups who feel under threat because of their sexual or religious identities. If human rights must be understood as a system of interrelated rights and not rights in opposition, then a proper balance between the two aspects should be sought. While legal means may well be necessary, they are probably not the most effective way to bridge the gap in this real-or at least apparent-dilemma.

We organise our presentation around three major themes that are central to the local Scandinavian context: gender equality, migration and moral grounds. This chapter shows the important role of gender equality work practices and how these practices now tend to be progressively incorporated in a broad Diversity Management construct, possibly leading to a less radical stance. Moreover, the comparison between Denmark and Sweden reveals the political associations with Diversity Management and migration in Denmark, but not in Sweden. Our third contribution unveils the tensions between the value of equality, which remains strong in the Scandinavian welfare state model, and the actual practices of Diversity Management.

   gender equality to decision-makers and neoliberalism to women's
   organizations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB Scholarship on gender and the European Union (EU) has consistently pointed out that EU gender equality policies have always been embedded in the logic of the market and that the economic framing has had negative impacts on the content and concepts of these policies. This article provides novel insights into this discussion by combining a discursive approach focused on framings with insights of feminist economists and examining how the relationship between gender equality and the economy has been conceptualized in EU policy documents from the 1980s up until the present day. The article identifies the key actors and processes behind the escalation of economic arguments for gender equality and makes visible the economic assumptions that underpin EU gender equality policy. It argues that in recent years the European institutions have intentionally developed and propagated a market-oriented gender equality discourse, the economic case for gender equality, which highlights the macroeconomic benefits of gender equality. The economic case reaffirms the gender-biased assumptions of neoclassical economic theory and legitimizes the EU's current economic priorities and policies, many of which are detrimental to gender equality. The European Commission represents the argument that gender equality contributes to economic growth as an innovative way to promote gender equality. However, the economic case represents a risk for gender equality advocates, because it may tame the emerging feminist criticism of the EU's economic policies and governance.

This grounded theory analysis of interviews with 35 heterosexual couples identifies three levels of attunement and describes the nature of their link with gender equality. Mutually attuned couples carried equal weight regarding intentionality, continual communication, partnership, mutual understanding, and joint decision making. Thwarted attunement and the unattuned were linked to gendered power imbalances. Implications highlight a need to address the gendered nature of attunement when helping couples build emotional connection.

AB The objective of this paper is to discusses gender discrimination in the labour market in Brazil and understand the role that the private sector plays in both sustaining and fighting gender inequality and the wage gap. It does so through the analysis of main problems and challenges for the achievement of full gender equality. It is a study in the field of law, economics, and social science. The paper first reviews the history of gender equality in Brazil, highlighting both current problems and progresses, in particular in the area of legal protection of female workers. It then discusses current gender inequality issues and wage gaps in the workplace in Brazil and analyses the reasons for the persistence of such inequality. Finally, the paper discusses the role of the private sector in both sustaining gender discrimination and promoting gender equality. This paper acknowledge progress in the area of gender equality achieved in Brazil in the past two decades, but it considers that discrimination is the key persistent issue that needs to be addressed to completely eradicate this problem. In particular, special attention should be given to the role of the private sector - something that has been so far overlooked in Brazil.

TI Free Trade, Fair Trade and Gender Inequality in Less Developed Countries
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Fair trade is often viewed as an alternative to free trade that reduces global inequality and poverty. This paper examines whether fair trade is truly an alternative to the free market, and as a consequence whether it can effectively advance gender equality and alleviate the poverty of women in less developed countries (LDCs). First, neoclassical economics and trade liberalization policies are reviewed. The paper then examines how fair trade seeks to correct market imperfections, thereby making the free market more efficient in distributing wealth. The ability of fair trade to address the central issues related to trade liberalization and women in LDCs is discussed, and the gendered structures of fair trade identified. Whether fair trade can provide gender equality within global capitalist structures is a theoretical matter that requires further empirical inquiry. Suggestions for future research, informed by feminist theories of the political economy, are provided. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Gendered Activation at the Expense of Gender Equality? Activation and
   Gender Equality as Competing Logics in the Swedish Welfare State
SO AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
AB This study aims to understand how goals of activation and gender equality interact in labor market programs directed towards activating unemployed participants. The study draws on interviews with 28 social workers and managers at four Swedish municipally governed labor market programs typically targeted towards poor, unemployed individuals with little to no attachment to the labor market or social insurance system. Our findings show that activation goals are understood to be clear cut and a dominant logic within the labor market programs. The gender equality goals are understood as fuzzy and subordinate to the activation logic. Our theoretical analysis, based on neo-institutional theory, shows that gendered activation as a hybrid logic is created within the four programs as a means of handling the competing logics of gender equality and activation. Gendered activation may be reasonable on an individual level, where women in long-term unemployment can sustain a higher income through work and become financially independent. In the context of the gender segregated labor market, gendered activation reproduces gendered inequalities when an increasing interest for activation policy among welfare states overshadows claims of gender equality. Furthermore, our study exemplifies the systemic reproduction of racist discourse within social- and labour market policies. Within the logic of gendered activation, migrant women become singled out as specifically problematic for Swedish society to handle when unemployment is given gendered and cultural explanations. Through the logic of gendered activation, gender equality goals become no-matter-what employment rather than employment leading to equal outcomes.

In this article, using nation-branding as an overarching perspective, we examine how this eagerness among the Nordics to be perceived as front-runners of gender rights affected the memory politics at play during the national commemoration of 100 years of women's suffrage in Finland (2006-2007), Norway (2013) and Sweden (2018-2022). In addition, we ask what national narratives the respective jubilee celebrations helped to facilitate - and whether those narratives correspond with the images that function as the primary brands of Finland, Norway and Sweden today.

TI Does energy poverty matter for gender inequality? Global evidence
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Gender inequality has improved slightly over recent decades, but it is still a critical issue across the globe, especially in developing countries. This study investigates the influence of energy poverty reduction on gender inequality, using a sample of 51 developing countries from 2002 to 2017 and considering four dimensions: employment, health, education, and socio-political-economic rights. By applying a two-step system generalised method of moments estimator to deal with endogeneity, the results are shown to be statistically robust. Reduction in energy poverty appears to increase employment opportunities for women, especially in industry and service sectors, which results in an improvement in the number of female wage and salaried workers in comparison with their male counterparts. Energy poverty reduction is also found to re-balance gender inequality in health indicators. Notably, reduced energy poverty is an influential factor in gender equality in education and socioeconomic rights. The results are checked for robustness by five different proxies of energy poverty reduction and different estimate strategies. Based on these findings, the governments of developing countries should focus principally on alleviating energy poverty as the first and most crucial policy to curb gender inequality.

It is argued that in the context of Cameroon, until these 'bigger' women renew their commitment to their grassroots sisters, the experience of gender equality will remain largely unequal. Only strong links between white-collar workers and less privileged women will span this chasm.

TI ADDING A GENDER PERSPECTIVE TO CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE AS AN
   INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATION
SO FRONTIERS OF LAW IN CHINA
AB China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has a significant impact on the gender equality of receiving countries. It is noted that many BRI countries are facing challenges to realizing gender equality. Nevertheless, China has not developed a gender-mainstreaming or rights-based approach to implement the BRI. Hence, this paper argues that it is China's international human rights obligation to develop such an approach and the country should adopt a gender policy in its BRI to ensure that its overseas investments and aid programs respect and promote gender equality. First, this paper maps China's overseas investments and aid globally and particularly in BRI countries, and examines, in general, how the BRI may have an impact on gender equality both globally and in BRI countries. Second, the paper reviews international standards on gender equality in transnational trade and foreign investment and aid projects in the context of international human rights' norms. It clarifies China's obligations to promote gender equality within the BRI framework under international law. Third, based on the aforementioned findings, this paper conducts a gap analysis on the gender policy followed by China's overseas investment and aid programs set within the context of international standards. Finally, the paper recommends some possible policy steps to ensure gender equality is mainstreamed in BRI projects of China.

TI Mexican parents' attitudes toward gender equality in family roles and
   leadership
SO ESTUDIOS DEMOGRAFICOS Y URBANOS
AB We analyze the parents' attitudes on gender equality regarding family roles and leaderships in the urban-popular sectors of Tijuana, Mexico. We use the Survey of Parents with Children in Junior High-schools in Tijuana, B.C., 2015, that includes information for 2 560 parents with children attending public junior high schools. Four indexes are designed that intend to measure gender equality regarding the maternity role, domestic roles and family leaderships. Logistic regression models are also estimated. The findings indicate coexistence of a great value assigned to the maternity role in women's life, plus moderately enthusiastic attitudes in favor of gender equality in the domestic roles, but less enthusiastic about sharing and switching family leaderships. The level of education showed to be the only variable statistically significant across the four indexes.

TI Do gender equality and work-life balance matter for innovation
   performance?
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB Gender equality and work-life balance are highlighted in innovation research, as those are directly related to the work environment of R&D personnel. This study empirically explores how scientists' attitudes valuing gender equality and work-life balance affect their quantitative and qualitative research performance, in basic science. As a result, the more important scientists value gender equality, the better the qualitative performance. Also, scientists who believe that work-life balance is important, produce qualitatively superior research outcomes. However, in the case of quantitative performance, it was not affected by how much scientists value gender equality and work-life balance. This study is a novel attempt to analyse the effect of scientist's attitude which value gender equality and work-life balance on their research performance.

TI Positive Contact with Feminist Women as a Predictor of Feminist
   Solidarity, Gender Privilege Awareness, and Public and Domestic Support
   for Gender Equality in Straight Men
SO SEX ROLES
AB Men can play an important role in supporting gender equality. In the present research, we draw on Intergroup Contact Theory to examine positive intergroup contact with feminist women as one factor that can encourage men to support gender equality. In one cross-sectional study (N = 170) and one half-longitudinal panel study (N = 240), we found that straight men who reported more positive contact with feminist women also reported greater feminist solidarity. Cross-sectional results indicated that straight men's solidarity with feminists, in turn, predicted more support for gender equality in public and domestic spheres and greater awareness of their gender privilege. The longitudinal results also supported the association between solidarity with feminists and gender privilege awareness, but not public and domestic support for gender equality. Decades of research has shown that positive intergroup contact can change attitudes. Our research suggests that, when it comes to gender equality, positive contact with feminist women may also encourage men to identify with feminists and raise their gender consciousness.

TI Europeanization and De-Europeanization of Turkey's Gender Equality
   Policy: The Case of the Istanbul Convention
SO JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES
AB Despite taking significant steps to comply with the Copenhagen criteria after receiving the candidate-country status in 1999, Turkey gradually moved away from European norms, values, and policy demands in various policy areas. This study explores (de)-Europeanization of Turkey's gender equality policy in terms of both legislative changes and the shifts observed in domestic actors' discourses over the past decade, focusing particularly on the debates surrounding the Istanbul Convention. It argues that the fading credibility of the EU conditionality coupled with domestic political dynamics led to the weakening of the EU as a reference point in domestic debates, where policies ensuring gender equality were reversed by pro-family conservative discourses and policies. The study points to domestic factors, including the country's authoritarian turn, and international factors such as the stalling EU-Turkey relations coupled with the backlash against gender equality in EU member states as the key dimensions of de-Europeanization of gender equality policy.

   Atheist Movement
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB This paper examines how a social movement reproduces gender inequalities and excludes women, even in the absence of explicitly sexist ideologies and the presence of a purported commitment to gender egalitarianism. I show how a US-based movement that appears conducive to challenging dominant gender ideology-the New Atheist Movement-instead maintains a gendered movement culture that support the persistence of gender inequalities. The movement culture embraces gendered discourses and rejects feminist claims for participation or recognition. Further, a culture of men's dominance-which extends to men making claims about women's rights and criticizing women who speak out against men's abuses of power-has contributed to women respondents feeling shut out and silenced. The paper contributes to improved knowledge of how gender inequalities reproduce themselves in social movements through movement culture.

TI Gender Equality Training through Corporate Theatre: An Analysis of
   Scenes
SO RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES-INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB The purpose of this article is to analyse corporate theatre-run diversity training examining gender equality in the workplace. It focuses on the first phase of the theatrical performance, namely the catalogue-proposed training scenes, performed by actor-trainers. The latter act out situations of gender inequality at work, with a view to preparing the second learning phase, dealing with stereotypes, analysis of behaviour displayed and possible solutions.
   The research seeks to understand how corporate theatre represents gender inequalities at work in the scenes introducing their diversity training. To answer this question, a qualitative methodology was chosen to expose the mechanisms at work in theatre training courses that support diversity management policies in organizations. In particular, it appears that these training courses focus on certain dimensions of gender equality, most often with a view to ensuring legal compliance, thus failing to take into account the complexity of the inequality phenomenon.
   This research shows how theatre functions according to a standard ideal and by exposing situations representative of the various barriers faced by women. However, while it is an original training tool for raising awareness, it is not enough on its own to grasp the full complexity of the phenomenon at work and change behaviour. It would therefore seem important in future research to better understand the training process and to measure in a longitudinal way the contribution of theatre training to gender equality.

SO CUESTIONES POLITICAS
AB From a documentary methodology close to legal hermeneutics, the article examines the problems of gender inequality; in particular, the study focuses on the problems of gender inequality in the Ukrainian National Police. The concepts and main stages of formation and development of gender policy in Ukraine are analyzed. The factors contributing to the emergence of gender inequality in the Ukrainian National Police have been studied. These include, firstly, the unequal position of women and men in society due to gender stereotypes. The article analyzes the components, characteristics, and functions of the mechanism for ensuring gender equality in the Ukrainian National Police. Particular attention is paid to the legal basis for ensuring gender equality in the activities of the Ukrainian National Police. To this end, the normative framework aimed at ensuring gender equality in the Ukrainian National Police was analyzed. It is concluded that, despite significant changes in the content of the laws to establish the principle of gender equality, there is still a long way to go to achieve effective equality.

TI Explaining sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions: The
   role of female peacekeepers and gender equality in contributing
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB Sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) is an endemic problem in UN peacekeeping missions. It is not only a gross human rights violation, but also threatens to challenge the legitimacy of the peacekeeping mission and undermines the promotion of gender equality in host countries. We examine if the composition of peacekeeping forces along two dimensions - the proportion of women and the records of gender (in)equality in the contributing countries - helps explain variation in SEA allegations. Analysis of mission-level information from 2009 to 2013 indicates that including higher proportions of both female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better records of gender equality is associated with lower levels of SEA allegations reported against military contingents. We conclude that substantial reductions in SEA perpetrated by peacekeepers requires cultivation of a value for gender equality among all peacekeepers - improving the representation of women may help but still stops short of addressing the root of the problem.

TI The impacts of gender inequality in education on economic growth in
   Tunisia: an empirical analysis
SO QUALITY & QUANTITY
AB The positive contribution of women's education to the economy and society has long been known in many countries, particularly in developing countries, to attract more attention. A large number of literatures on women's education clearly suggest that educating a woman is equivalent to educating a family and that this woman is better educated than her counterparts, men, in many respects. The low level of education of women in Muslim countries, most of which are in developing countries. The increase in the level of education depends on the elimination of gender inequalities in education. Muslim countries must use all their resources to achieve their economic development goals. Women's participation in the economy is a major economic resource that is not widely used in Muslim countries. The literature (Dollar and Garti in Gender inequality, income, and growth: are good times good for women? World Bank Working Paper, 21-2 1999; Barro in The Contribution of Human and Social Capital to Sustained Economic Growth and Well Being, Canada Government, Portage 2001; Schltz 2002; Klasen 2002; Knowles et al. in Oxf. Econ. Pap. 54 118-149 2002) suggests that gender equality has a positive effect on economic growth. Taking into account Muslim countries, it can reasonably be argued that the rate of the gender effect on economic growth is higher in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of gender inequality in education on economic growth for tunisia will be explored, using econometric techniques. The document will take into account all variables of primary school graduation, obtaining a high school diploma, obtaining a high school diploma and obtaining a University degree with economic growth will be examined in detail for the period 1970-2009. At this level Women's contribution to the economy is threefold. The first is that the increase in the level of human capital, as a result, decrease the fertility rate of women. The second argument is that the infant mortality rate could decrease by decreasing the fertility rate of women. Third, raising the level of education of women can affect the level of education of the next generation positively. In this context, in order to understand the long-term relationships between these variables, i.e. gender inequality in education and economic growth, a co-integration approach will be applied. The empirical results show that there is a long-term relationship between these variables.

TI Persistent Paradoxes, Pragmatic Postfeminism: How Young Women Negotiate
   the Contradictions of Gender Equality
SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB Due to social change and gender detraditionalisation, young women in the Global North have been positioned as agentic subjects who can benefit from increasing freedom in education and work. However, there remains a gap between gender equality as a powerful cultural norm and the persistent inequalities that continue to shape people's lives. Focusing on Finland, this article examines how this gap is negotiated by young women transitioning from post-compulsory education to work in two different fields: care and media. Building on the theories of postfeminism as a sensibility, the article analyses how field-specific conceptualisations of gender equality and patterns of gendered disadvantages in the two fields shape young women's understandings of their imagined futures in the Finnish labour market. The article develops the notion of "pragmatic postfeminism" to show that young women selectively deploy elements of postfeminist sensibility as a pragmatic resource to manage the persistent gender equality paradoxes of the Finnish labour market.

TI Gender equality approaches in water, sanitation, and hygiene programs:
   Towards gender-transformative practice
SO FRONTIERS IN WATER
AB The recent (re-)emergence of gender-transformative approaches in the development sector has focused on transforming the gender norms, dynamics, and structures which perpetuate inequalities. Yet, the application of gender-transformative approaches within water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programing remains nascent as compared with other sectors. Adopting a feminist sensemaking approach drawing on literature and practice, this inquiry sought to document and critically reflect on the conceptualization and innovation of gender-transformative thinking in the Australian Government's Water for Women Fund. Through three sensemaking workshops and associated analysis, participants developed a conceptual framework and set of illustrative case examples to support WASH practitioners to integrate strengthened gender-transformative practice. The multi-layered framework contains varied entry points to support multi-disciplinary WASH teams integrating gender equality, as skills and resources permit. Initiatives can be categorized as insensitive, sensitive, responsive or transformative, and prompted by five common motivators (welfare, efficiency, equity, empowerment, and transformative requality). The framework has at its foundation two diverging tendencies: toward instrumental gender potential and toward transformative gender potential. The article draws on historical and recent WASH literature to illustrate the conceptual framework in relation to: (i) community mobilization, (ii) governance, service provision, and oversight, and (iii) enterprise development. The illustrative examples provide practical guidance for WASH practitioners integrating gendered thinking into programs, projects, and policies. We offer a working definition for gender-transformative WASH and reflect on how the acknowledgment, consideration, and transformation of gender inequalities can lead to simultaneously strengthened WASH outcomes and improved gender equality.

TI This Train Has Left the Station: The German Gender Equality Regime on
   Course Towards a Social Democratic Model (2013-17)
SO GERMAN POLITICS
AB Based on a concept of gender equality regimes that combines measures for employment, care work, and anti-discrimination, we analyse how Germany has continued to shift from a conservative to a social democratic gender regime from 2013 to 2017. We contend first, that the reform agenda in family policy continuously changed and is now geared towards a social democratic gender regime. Secondly, we observe diffusion processes and increased social democratisation of related policy areas such as employment, anti-discrimination and gender variance. Thirdly, we argue that the parliamentary consensus for egalitarian gender policies has opened up a strategic terrain for right-wing opposition and new forms of political polarisation. Empirically, we draw on an analysis of party manifestos, the coalition agreement between the Union parties (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), as well as political reforms in the fields of family policy, gender equality on the labour market, and anti-discrimination for sexual minorities. Our review shows that there has been a tangible shift towards a social democratic gender equality regime in all three policy fields. At the same time, the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) on the far right became the new populist voice of parliamentary opposition against this reform agenda.

TI A Critical Analysis of South Korea's ODA Projects for Gender Equality
SO ASIAN WOMEN
AB In light of the internationally recognized twin-track approach to aid for gender equality, this paper critically reviews South Korea's gender-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects. Building on previous studies, we reveal the three-stage dualism inherent in South Korean gender equality and mainstream agendas in terms of conceptualization, implementation, and impact. Applying this framework to South Korean gender-related aid, the paper analyzes strategies and patterns of gender projects, presenting survey and interview data regarding development workers' perceptions of aid for gender equality. The scope of this analysis is limited to gender-related aid projects by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The major challenges to gender mainstreaming in South Korea's aid efforts are twofold. First, South Korea's gender-related ODA projects fail to take into account the substantive aspect of the conceptualization of gender mainstreaming, contravening the international trend of adopting a twin-track approach. Second, they fall short in terms of both institutional and operational inputs in implementation, analyzing the impact of gender mainstreaming based simply on the number of female beneficiaries rather than on changes in women's status or decision-making power.

SO REVISTA COMPLUTENSE DE EDUCACION
AB The analysis of the attitudes that students show towards gender equality is useful for the prevention, detection and attention to possible sexist behaviors in the adolescent population. The general purpose of this article is to know the attitudes toward gender equality in a sample of 316 Primary and Secondary Education students in schools of Murcia. The instrument employed for data collection was the scale of Garcia-Perez et al (2010). Quantitative data derived from the scale have been analyzed with the SPSS 22.0 statistical package. The results show unfavorable attitudes towards equality. In this regard, significant differences between boys and girls and between stages are perceived. Globally, higher levels of sexism are found on the relationship and personal levels. In this line, the scores achieved place students from both education stages in a sexist attitude, with the exception of the sociocultural area, in which the students of Primary Education are in an adaptive attitude. By profiles, the majority of students are placed in a sexist attitude (82.9%), followed by an adaptive stance (16.1%) and lastly, egalitarian (0.9%). Finally, in view of the results, the implementation of urgent measures seems necessary in order to reverse this data.

TI Gender and highbrow cultural participation in Europe: The effect of
   societal gender equality and development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY
AB Existing individual-level research links women's higher participation in high-status cultural activities to their position in work and family spheres. This article studies how cross-national variation in women's and men's cultural participation relates to societal care- and work-related gender equality and development. Multilevel analyses on Eurobarometer data (2013) indicate that male engagement in the feminine domain of care and societal development stimulates frequent participation in highbrow culture, but more for men than for women, thus partly explaining gender gap variation in highbrow cultural participation across European Union countries. We conclude that men play an important but underestimated role in the explanation of the gender gap.

TI 'Mother Russia' at work - Gender divisions in the medical profession
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB One of the most significant changes in the medical professions in Europe is the trend towards feminization. Some of the patterns of gender inequality arising from the feminization of the European medical professions are clearly apparent within the Russian medical profession, which experienced feminization 70 years ago. Yet Little is known about the processes by which these patterns of gender inequality emerged and were maintained. This article is based on interviews with female doctors in Voronezh, Russia in 1996. It explores the attitudes of these women to gender divisions within the medical profession. This is placed within the wider context of Soviet and post-Soviet employment and family policies directed at women. It is suggested that the material and ideological focus on women's role in reproduction had direct implications for the choices women made in relation to paid labour.

TI Gender equality, value violations, and prejudice toward Muslims
SO GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
AB Why are people prejudiced toward Muslims? In this research, we used a value violation framework to predict that when people believe Muslims value gender equality less than reference groups, it creates a value violation that leads to prejudice. In Study 1, people believed that Muslims value gender equality less than Christians, and the more people believed that Muslims do not value gender equality, the more they reported prejudice toward Muslims. In Study 2, we manipulated perceptions of how much Muslims value gender equality by giving people evidence that Muslims either do or do not support women's rights. Afterward, we measured people's prejudice toward Muslims and desire for social distance. Telling people that Muslims value gender equality reduced both prejudice and the desire for social distance. These effects occurred by increasing people's beliefs that they share values with Muslims, highlighting the importance of values as a source of prejudice.

TI Addressing gender inequality: Stumbling blocks and roads ahead
SO GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
AB Despite many positive changes in terms of gender equality in recent decades, women remain underrepresented in positions of power and prestige, and continue to shoulder disproportionate amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This special issue brings together an examination of the different ways in which gender inequality can be addressed, the efficacy of such approaches, and the consequences these approaches can have. In this introduction to the special issue, we discuss the focus of past and present gender research and outline issues which have received less attention. We further give an overview of the papers in this special issue, which focus on a diverse range of ways in which gender inequality can be addressed, such as collective action, workplace diversity initiatives and parental leave policies, gender-fair language, and government policies. Taken together, these papers illustrate (a) the importance of ensuring that initiatives are evidence-based, (b) the ways in which we can maximize the effectiveness of interventions, and (c) the need to understand when these initiatives may inadvertently backfire.

TI The effect of gender equality on happiness: Statistical modeling and
   analysis
SO HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL
AB In this article, the researcher presents linear regression models that describe how five gender-equality indexes affect individuals' perceptions of well-being and happiness, controlling for their economic income and weighed by the population of the countries that contribute to the models. The logical premise of this study is that gender equality is not only favorable for women, but it is also conducive to fostering the greatest level of happiness for all people. The researcher believes that most findings confirmed this assumption and the opinion of John Stuart Mill regarding gender equality, while two exceptions are explained by social quality theory and the male breadwinner model.

TI Attitudes towards gender equality and perception of democracy in the
   Arab world
SO DEMOCRATIZATION
AB This article analyses the relationship between support of democracy and attitudes to human rights, in particular, support for gender equality, in the countries covered by the first wave of the Arab Barometer project. We use cluster analysis and negative binomial regression modelling to show that, unlike in most countries of the world, correlation between support of democracy and gender equality is very low in the Arab countries. There is a group of people in the region who support both democracy and gender equality, but they are a small group (about 17% of the population) of elderly and middle-aged people characterized by higher education and social status. A substantial number of poorly educated males express support for democracy but not for gender equality. Many people, especially young males aged 25-35 in 2007, are against both gender equality and democracy. Younger people tend to be both better educated and more conservative, those belonging to the 25-34 age group being the most patriarchal in their gender attitudes. Yet, controlling for age, education does have a positive effect on gender equality attitudes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon may reflect two simultaneous processes going on in the Middle East. On the one hand, people are getting more educated, urbanized, etc., which means the continuation of modernization. On the other hand, the fact that older people are the most liberal age group may point to a certain retrogression of social values in the younger generations.

TI Pathways to Gender-equitable Men: Findings from the International Men
   and Gender Equality Survey in Eight Countries
SO MEN AND MASCULINITIES
AB Efforts to promote gender equality have recognized the importance of involving men and boys. Yet, in general, we have done little in terms of large-scale research in the Global South to understand how men are responding to the global gender equality agenda. This article presents findings from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES), one of the most comprehensive efforts of its kind to gather data on men's attitudes and practices related to gender equality in eight low- and middle-income countries: Brazil, Chile, Mexico, India, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda. It provides a current picture of men's attitudes about gender and gender equality, explores the determinants of equitable attitudes, and investigates the associations between equitable attitudes and relationship behaviors. We find that men report positive but ambivalent attitudes toward gender equality, and that education, income, and more equitable practices in men's childhood homes are associated with men's more equitable attitudes and practices. Finally, we show that in most countries, men's equitable attitudes are also associated with more equitable practices, including more participation in the home and reduced use of violence, as well as higher sexual satisfaction. The findings suggest both the need for program approaches that change attitudes, as well as policy and structural approaches that create lived experiences of gender equality for men. Given how much early childhood experiences influenced men's adult attitudes and practices, the findings also emphasize the need for programs and policies to promote equitable caregiving.

TI Gender Equality and Fertility: Which Equality Matters?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE
AB Does gender equality matter for fertility? Demographic findings on this issue are rather inconclusive. We argue that one reason for this is that the complexity of the concept of gender equality has received insufficient attention. Gender equality needs to be conceptualized in a manner that goes beyond perceiving it as mere "sameness of distribution". It needs to include notions of gender equity and thus to allow for distinguishing between gender difference and gender inequality. We sketch three dimensions of gender equality related to employment, financial resources, and family work, which incorporate this understanding: (1) the ability to maintain a household; (2) agency and the capability to choose; and (3) gender equity in household and care work. We explore their impact on childbearing intentions of women and men using the European Generations and Gender Surveys. Our results confirm the need for a more nuanced notion of gender equality in studies on the relationship between gender equality on fertility. They show that there is no uniform effect of gender equality on childbearing intentions, but that the impact varies by gender and by parity.

The study finds that the overall gender equality of higher education has been improved in China, though segmentally-maintained inequality (SMI) persists for female college students from rural and lower social status.

AB This article presents an overview of shifts in European Union (EU) gender equality policies since the 1990s. It shows that attention to gender equality was increasingly justified on instrumental grounds, for example by promoting childcare provision to enable women to do wage work. After the 2008 crisis, all policy came to be justified on efficiency (growth) grounds, and EU policies - such as advocating cuts to public expenditure and public-sector wages - actively undermined gender equality. The article urges feminists not to rely on gender mainstreaming but to develop a broad-based coalition against neoliberal and austerity policies.

TI Exploring the use of resources to support gender equality in Australian
   workplaces
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB Issue addressed Numerous resources exist to support workplaces to undertake gender equality work; however, it is often unclear which existing resources are being utilised by Australian workplaces. One group that can provide insight into the use of existing resources is the professionals who have undertaken gender equality work in their organisation. Methods Purposive sampling was used to identify informants with experience undertaking gender equality work. A sample of 12 informants was recruited from five employment sectors: five informants from the women('s health sector; two from other organisations in the health sector; three from local government; and one each from manufacturing and education. One in-depth semi-structured interview was conducted with each informant. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes emerged from data analysis: "Organisational Context," "Legitimising Gender Equality Work," "Demystifying Gender Equality" and "Embedding Gender Equality into the Workplace." Mechanisms such as drawing on the evidence base, developing internal communications strategies, establishing a working group, undertaking training, conducting an audit, and reviewing policies and procedures were used to embed gender-based considerations into the workplace. A range of resources to underpin most of these approaches was discussed by informants. Conclusions Informants had a sound understanding of approaches they could use to address existing gender inequality; however, they did not always utilise existing resources to support them to undertake their chosen approach. So what? A clearer online database needs to be established to allow workplaces to access a compilation of existing resources and any evaluation on their use.

TI Delivering gender justice in academia through gender equality plans?
   Normative and practical challenges
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB This paper employs the concept of epistemic justice to examine the potential for gender equality plans (GEPs) to bring about sustainable transformative change towards gender equality in higher education. Mindful of both the limitations and opportunities of gender policy interventions, the paper highlights the importance of approaching gender inequality as a problem of justice and power rather than as an issue of "loss of talent." The paper draws on Fricker's account of epistemic justice as well as on Bourdieu's analysis of power in the academic field, to evaluate seven GEPs in European universities for their potential to transform gender-power relations in academia. The analysis reveals that insufficient attention is paid to the role of academic power in creating gender injustice at all institutional levels and to the role of organizational culture in the perpetuation of gender inequalities in those settings. The study suggests that the incorporation of an epistemic justice lens in the creation of GEPs would address gendered power relationships and lead to sustainable equitable outcomes.

TI Examining Gender Inequality and Armed Conflict at the Subnational Level
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES
AB A growing body of quantitative research points to a robust relationship between gender inequality and armed conflict. In order to progress our understanding of this relationship, we make two contributions. First, we identify three potential explanations as to why gender inequality can be associated with conflict-gender inequality norms, societal capacity, and gendered socioeconomic development- and suggest an empirical strategy to gauge the explanatory leverage of each explanation. Second, we offer a more nuanced treatment of the dependent variable at the subnational level, moving beyond a dichotomized view of armed conflict to accounting for both its level and type. We test our hypotheses using district-level data on gender inequality and conflicts in India, covering the 1989-2014 period. Our findings show that the three explanations do not produce the same outcomes in the data. We argue that this speaks to the need to adjudicate between different forms of mechanisms that can connect gender inequality to conflict. Our results show support for women's status being important for understanding a society's capacity to handle conflict nonviolently. On the negative side, gendered socioeconomic developments resulting in a male surplus create conditions conducive for armed conflict, particularly in urban areas. A more surprising finding is that the gender inequality norm, in and of itself, does not appear to have a strong effect on the risk of armed conflict. This does not mean that we can disregard the explanation, but it underlines that there can be inherent problems with this commonly used argument.

TI Achieving Gender Equality through Paid and Unpaid Work: An Exploration
   of Mothers' Perspectives on Work
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The prevailing understanding of work as paid work is reflected in political efforts to achieve gender equality, which include emphasising that women, like men, should increasingly pursue paid work. This exploratory research aims to question whether this idea to align female with male life patterns is conducive to gender equality and to promote new insights based on mothers' experiences. Our analysis is based on guided interviews with eight Swiss mothers in part-time employment who have at least one child aged three or older, and a working partner in the same household. The interviews show that these mothers do not share the expectation that all mothers should take on the main responsibility for domestic and care work, nor the expectation that all women should be doing full-time paid work. They would like to see greater acceptance and appreciation of different forms of work. This research concludes that gender justice can be understood as a freedom of choice that includes both the right to be doing paid work and the right to have time for domestic and care work-for men and women. Gender equality efforts do not have to be restricted to one form of work, but can leave room for different types of work and the appreciation of them.

TI Gender Equality and Health in High-Income Countries: A Systematic Review
   of Within-Country Indicators of Gender Equality in Relation to Health
   Outcomes
SO WOMENS HEALTH REPORTS
AB Background: Gender equality is recognized as an important political, social, and economic goal in many countries around the world. At a country level, there is evidence that gender equality may have an important influence on health. Historically gender equality has mainly been measured to allow for between-country, rather than within-country comparisons; and the association between gender equality and health outcomes within countries has been under-researched. This article thus aimed to systematically review within-country indicators of gender equality in public health studies and assess the extent to which these are related to health outcomes. Materials and Methods: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach with two independent reviewers. Results: Data from the eight included studies revealed that there was heterogeneity in the way gender equality has been measured as a multidimensional construct. Associations between gender equality and a number of different health outcomes were apparent, including mortality, mental health, morbidity, alcohol consumption, and intimate partner violence, with gender equality mostly associated with better health outcomes. Conclusions: Further investigation into the effects of gender equality on health outcomes, including a clear conceptualization of terms, is critical for the development of policies and programs regarding gender equality.

Deviating from this Orientalist narrative, we formulate a context-dependent agentic-socialization framework, which acknowledges religiosity's and gender equality's multidimensionality along with the MENA's political-institutional diversity. We expect that religious service attendance and devotion decrease support for gender equality in politics but not in education. Moreover, we theorize that open political structures allow citizens to express agency and dissociate from dominant patriarchal patterns. We test these expectations using WVS and AB data covering 50,000 respondents in 39 MENA country-years. Our results show religious service attendance indeed reduces support for gender equality. However, more devoted citizens support gender equality in education more than the less devoted, and in more democratic polities and in polities with more freedom of press, the same is found for political gender equality. Moreover, support for gender equality is greater in open polities than closed ones, but this gap closes when people frequent religious services. These results suggest MENA citizens are not univocally passively socialized by patriarchal religious views, but actively engage with other interpretations, provided these are not banned by oppressive governments.

TI GENDER EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY IN NUMERACY: THE CASE OF LATIN AMERICA
   AND THE CARIBBEAN, 1880-1949
SO REVISTA DE HISTORIA ECONOMICA
AB This article outlines the development of gender disparities in education for 28 Latin American and Caribbean countries for the period from 1880 to 1949, using age heaping techniques. We explore in particular the hypothesis of a U-shaped development of women's education during economic development, i.e., a decrease in gender equality at lower levels of overall education, and increasing gender equality at higher levels. For the downward sloping part, we find some evidence, although this part is relatively small. The upward sloping part is strongly confirmed. We also find that non-Hispanic Caribbean countries had substantially lower gender inequality rates than Latin American countries. A second major contribution is to document the development of average numerical abilities (of both genders) in these 28 countries.

The article analyzes the ideas of gender equality in a European and national context and the applicable terminology. Discussions on indicators of gender equality in higher education, national specifics and approaches to their implementation are presented. The aim of the article is to systematize the issues, methodological problems and solutions in the development of GEPs, examining the theoretical foundations, regulation, statistics and good practices in Europe and Bulgaria. The topic is gaining popularity in our country and so far the emphasis has been on building organizational capacity and culture, instead of engaging with specific indicators of gender equality.

TI Developing a conceptual evaluation framework for gender equality
   interventions in research and innovation
SO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING
AB In this article, we discuss the development of a conceptual evaluation framework to design and assess gender equality interventions and their effects in research and innovation. The conceptual framework presented herewith embraces the complexity, gender-sensitive and theory-based evaluation approaches ensuring that design and evaluation of gender equality interventions consider the complex systems that constitute the context in which the interventions operate. The evaluation framework offers a non-linear concept, where the notion of contribution - not attribution - to achieve impact is central to the integration of team, organizational and system factors in policy design and evaluation. The paper opens the "black box" to address the question of how and why a policy intervention works and in which context and discusses a systematic process on how to approach the interwoven linkages between input, implementation and effects in gender equality interventions in research and innovation, accounting for context sensitivity and methodological pluralism. The evaluation framework may serve as reference for researchers, evaluators, policymakers and other stakeholders in designing and assessing gender equality interventions, and in further developing their evidence, and theoretical and methodological base.

SO MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE
AB Research questionHow do gender quotas transform sport management, beyond increasing the proportion of women among sport managers? Building on findings from the literature on quotas in sport management, this article asks whether quotas make gender equality initiatives more common. This research question fills a research gap, since the aforementioned literature is based principally on the case of Norway.Research methodsThis article analyzes the impact of the 2014 gender quota imposed for boards of national sport federations in Spain (of at least three women or 33% of board members) with the help of interviews with a purposive sample of 86 board members (43 women and 43 men) comprising 66% of national sport federations.Results and findingsThis study shows that the Spanish quota made gender equality initiatives more common.ImplicationsTo scholars and sport managers alike, this article provides a tool to understand change in sport organizations once quotas are adopted.

TI The Europeanisation of gender equality at the municipal level: insights

SO LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES
AB The Republic of Cyprus is a small EU member state, whose domestic structures replicate a durable tradition of centralisation, limiting the overall role of local government . This work employs the vertical research dimension of top-down Europeanisation to investigate the influence of European Integration vis-a-vis the promotion of gender equality at the municipal Level . It adopts a local government comparative viewpoint to analyse the adoption of the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life by the Cypriot Municipalities (2011-present). This work utilises specific analytical frameworks (Europeanisation and Historical Institutionalism) to provide a theoretically and empirically informed analysis based on empirical data resulting from three field studies (2013, 2019 and 2021) and respective electoral data. Our research results suggest that the effects of Europeanisation, in terms of promoting gender equality, have been limited due to long-lasting formal and informal institutional restrictions.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB This article gives an overview of the development of gender equality and women's participation in adult learning and education in the history of the International Conferences on Adult Education (CONFINTEA). Though the equality of rights was highlighted throughout the various conferences, the first Global Report on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) observed that a gender gap in the participation in adult learning and education still persisted in 2009. This is especially remarkable with regard to the impact of CONFINTEA V in 1997, because it focused on the issue of women's participation and gender equality. A review of the CONFINTEA VI programme elements and the national reports prepared by UNESCO Member States in 2008 reveals that gender issues have to some extent moved from the centre of attention to the periphery. This article therefore tries to explore how gender principles are acknowledged in CONFINTEA VI and its follow-up.

AB Gender equality has been promoted among social responsibility by mining companies. A key challenge for the management of sustainable development programs for gender equality is the need to develop sophisticated approaches that work at both local and international levels. In this paper, the researcher investigates the impact of CSR programs on gender equality (through labour, environment, training, and economic activities) and life experiences of female workers, members of the community, and their family in a mining community in the Southern Laos. The results show that CSR programs focusing on promoting equal opportunities at workplace, professional development, and other economic opportunities can influence the likelihood of sustainable development by mining companies.

TI Does country-level gender equality explain individual risk of intimate
   partner violence against women? A multilevel analysis of individual
   heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) in the European Union
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Gender equality is widely accepted as an important explanatory factor for the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women. However, the relationship is not straightforward, as high country-level gender equality is not always associated with lower IPV prevalence. We apply 'multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy' (MAIHDA) to (i) quantify the extent to which the country of residence determines individual risk of IPV and (ii) investigate the association between country-level gender equality and individual experience of IPV, and to which extent this association explains the observed between-country differences. Methods: Using data from the 2012 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey on violence against women we applied MAIHDA to analyse experiences of physical and sexual IPV among 42 000 women living in the EU. We fitted three consecutive models, and calculated specific individual contextual effects (measures of association) as well as the general contextual effects (measures of variance) and the discriminatory accuracy (DA). Results: Our findings show that the relationship between experiences of IPV and country-level gender equality is weak and heterogeneous. The general contextual effect is small and the DA is low, indicating that country boundaries are rather irrelevant for understanding the individual risk of IPV. Conclusions: Findings from the present study do not imply that that gender equality is unimportant in relation to IPV, but rather that information on country of residence or country-level gender equality does not discriminate very well with regards to individual experiences of IPV in cross-national comparisons.

TI Men as middle managers doing and undoing gender in organizations
SO EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Although middle managers are often presumed to resist change in organizations, they can act as change drivers. This article shows how men as middle managers aim to act as change agents for gender equality through doing and undoing gender. Through practices such as bonding with women by objectifying them, being engaged in women-focused initiatives and using gender equality to advance their own careers, men as middle managers aim to create gender equality but often reaffirm existing gender inequalities. However, men were more successful in moving towards gender equality when developing those who are different from themselves. The article contributes to understanding the complexities in analyzing and conceptualizing how men as middle managers are undoing gender by showing that many undoing gender practices can lead to a (re)doing of gender. However, only by engaging with those complexities can men in middle management positions become effective change agents for gender equality.

SO POLICE PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
AB This paper aims to analyse and discuss conditions for gender equality in police leadership. This is done by interviewing 28 sworn police leaders in Sweden, and using a doing gender perspective for analyses. The results show that women and, to a greater extent, men in police leadership do gender traditionally. Explanations for the lack of female leaders and strategies for increasing the number of female leaders are shown to either focus on women as individuals (mostly men) or organisational structure and culture (mostly women). Further, strategies to reach gender equality goals are critically examined. These could be used to create concrete diversity and equality work within police and other organisations. Whether or not quantitative gender equality work (raising the number of females in leadership positions) can create changes in qualitative gender equality (the learning of new norms to change experiences of inclusion and exclusion in relation to gender) is discussed.

The data analyzed and synthesized in this paper include relevant statistics and literatures based on the issue of gender equality, particularly the target goal 5.2: Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation. The paper reveals that violence against women and girls exists at high level in Thailand. The status of Thai women is not as accepted as Thai men. The Thai government has shown greater attempts to solve this issue by imposing laws and regulations as well as measures. One of the possible approaches to erase the problem is to tackle with the root cause which is the perception and attitude of gender differences through appropriate socialization processes i.e. formal and informal education.

TI Advancing gender equality through the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in
   Science: an exploratory study of women's and men's perceptions
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB Background: While in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, higher education and research institutions are widely engaged with the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science to advance gender equality, empirical research on this process and its impact is rare. This study combined two data sets (free-text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom.
   Methods: The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews. Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.
   Results: Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women's careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias. Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences. Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.
   Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes. To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy.

AB Gender-equality work in Sweden is increasingly carried out by private consultancy firms. In this article, we explore the rationalities that govern Swedish market-based gender-equality policy through an analysis of the subject positions that are made available to gender-equality consultants. The article is an adapted version of our published work in Swedish. We analyse what types of agency these positions enable and preclude, as well as how they shape the meaning of gender equality and the content of gender-equality work. While market logics constrain the space for critical analysis and cause gender equality to be subordinated to other goals, consultants nevertheless find ways to resist these tendencies in pursuit of transformative change.

TI FINANCING OF 2018 POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS IN MEXICO: GENDER INEQUALITY
SO VIVAT ACADEMIA
AB In Mexico, there is gender inequality between men and woman that can even take the political sphere: during the electoral campaigns to elect the 128 seats in the senate and the 500 federal deputies in the 2018 elections, the parties invested 30 percent of the funding for female candidates while the male candidates received 70 percent. Using a quantitative research methodology, we analyzed the funding financial reports of the National Electoral Institute and demonstrated the existing gender inequality in political campaigns. It is proposed to create compensatory laws and policies with a gender perspective to ensure joint candidacies for the political campaigns of the 2021 elections.

SO POLITICKE VEDY
AB The issue of gender equality and respect for women's human rights is becoming highly topical in the context of growing security challenges. International cooperation in the field of conflict prevention and peace-keeping requires the Slovak Republic to support the increased political participation of women and strengthen their position in decision-making processes in local, national and international institutions and organizations, including the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. The article therefore deals with the systematization and analysis of basic documents and guidelines concerning domestic and international crisis management in the field of gender equality, specifically provides information on the state of gender equality in the conditions of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. Taking into account the gender needs of members of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic requires the introduction of a gender perspective and the use of gender equality indicators in the evaluation of all new projects and programs, which we currently consider to be a major challenge for modern organizations.

To answer these questions, we collected data on Israeli men and women who were employed in the first week of March prior to the lockdown of the economy, and again in the last week of April (after the economy was shut down, but before it was reopened). We find that the con-sequences of the economic downturn following the coronavirus for gender equality are harsh, with women's employment and income more severely affected than men's.

AB This paper examines the nature of female offending patterns in relationship to societal gender equality using cross-national analysis of 27 European countries for the year 2006. Importantly, our analysis uses a conceptually innovative indicator (the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index) to determine relative levels of gender equality. Results show that countries with a narrower gender gap in the Global Gender Gap indexes of political empowerment were likely to have a higher female prosecution rate, and that political empowerment was also significantly associated with female conviction rates as well as rates of property offending. The pattern of results generally supports the liberation thesis. Finally, limitations and suggestions for future study are addressed.

TI ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF GENDER EQUALITY
SO MANCHESTER SCHOOL
AB We present an evolutionary growth model where the degree of gender equality evolves towards the value maximizing social output. It follows that a woman's bargaining power should depend positively on her relative productivity. When an economy is less developed, physical strength plays a key role in production and thus, total output is greater when the man gets a larger share. As society develops and accumulates physical capital and human capital, the woman becomes relatively more productive, which drives the output maximizing social norm towards gender equality. Empirical results support these predictions of the theoretical model. Simulations show that in the long run, an economy with gender equality can outperform an economy where gender balance of power maximizes social output, although in the short run, it can lag behind.

AB This article studies how gender and relationships between genders are addressed in educational media of the GDR, i.e., in schoolbooks and children's books. It investigates the relationship between text and picture and the depictions of gender within. Gender equality was part of the socialist identity in GDR. But women were especially worthy of depiction only in regard to care and reproductive work. Three theses show that women are presented as working mothers, that reproductive care is mainly female and predominantly girls do societal reproductive work. Thus, it appears that gender equality in education is a myth of the GDR.

TI Do rural development programmes promote gender equality on farms? The
   case of Slovenia
SO GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB The necessity of gender equality in agriculture has been identified as a relevant political issue and incorporated into strategic documents and programmes of the EU. However, until now, not much has been examined about the actual contribution of these policy actions and programmes to the everyday life of farm women; there is a considerable gap in the data about women in farming across Europe, particularly for new member states. The article addresses this issue by focusing on the situation of gender equality on farms in Slovenia. Pertaining to two measures of The Rural Development Programme 2004-2006 - the Setting Up of Young Farmers and the Early Retirement of Farmers - the aim of the analysis is to compare the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of these two measures at family farms in terms of their development capacities and their inclination towards gender equality. Results based on the survey data 'Generations and Gender Relations on Slovenian Farms 2007' revealed the above-mentioned measures did indeed reach those family farms that showed better development capacities in terms of economic and demographic conditions. However, the farms did not show significant development in terms of gender equality as examined through division of work and decision-making on family farms. The rigidity in gender statuses and roles on family farms is explained and discussed through the issue of unequal access of women to farmland ownership and agricultural education, and through persistently weak institutional support to increase political participation and power for farm women.

This article traces its implementation in Scotland, following devolution. It focuses on the GED's perceived potential as a policy tool for driving change in the way public bodies, particularly those responsible for the delivery of criminal justice, respond to gender-based violence. We highlight the distinctive approach taken to gender-based violence in Scotland, and argue that despite some evidence of mainstreaming, the real potential for change afforded by the GED was never fully realised.

TI Bargaining for gender equality in Aotearoa New Zealand: Flexible work
   arrangements in collective agreements, 2007-2019
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB Collective bargaining remains an important yet underexplored mechanism in the pursuit of workplace gender equality. Through gender equality bargaining efforts, unions seek to address the lack of equity for working women. Yet little is known of the extent of equality bargaining provisions, or about where provisions and the factors that influence their availability occur. Contributing to this disparity is a lack of data measuring gender equality provisions in collective agreements. This article analyses key trends in the collective regulation of flexible work provisions in Aotearoa New Zealand from 2007 to 2019. Results show modest growth in the scope and coverage of flexible work provisions, the majority of which have occurred in the public sector. Marked differences across sectors and industries suggest the influence of factors such as women's rising labour force participation and feminisation of union membership and its leadership, particularly within industries where union density has grown. Findings underscore the need for contextualisation of collective regulation in opportunity structures and the ongoing frailty of women's access to gender equality.

SO JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC ECONOMICS
AB Knowledge of the long relationship between gender equality and economic growth is hampered by the lack of information and resources on the various dimensions of gender equality. This paper is a first attempt to assess the size of the gender gap and investigate its relationship with economic growth from a historical perspective. Exploiting a unique census-based dataset of 86 French counties in the mid-nineteenth century, I construct a historical gender gap index measuring the size of the gap between men and women in three critical areas: economic opportunities, educational attainment, and health. A county comparison allows me to identify the strengths and weaknesses of French counties in closing the gender gap. I find that France can be divided into two main areas, the North and the South. In particular, the Northern counties that have done most to narrow the gap display better economic performance. Boys' and girls' education and family structures appear to be crucial determinants of gender equality. Gender equality is positively and significantly associated with economic performance. Accounting for the multi-dimensions of gender equality is crucial for economic development.

TI Maneuvering within postfeminism: A study of gender equality
   practitioners in Danish academia
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB In Denmark, gender equality in academia has seen limited progress during the past 30 years. To improve our understanding of this persistent problem, this article examines gender equality practitioners in relation to the wider discursive context of Danish society. Theorizing Denmark as a "postfeminist gender regime," I analyze how practitioners negotiate a space for action in a context which generally opposes gender equality initiatives. I introduce the notion of "maneuvering" as a way to understand this negotiation between hegemonic, postfeminist discourses, on the one hand, and marginal and potentially subversive discourses on the other. Practitioners may maneuver in how they understand inequality and potential solutions, and in the meetings between them, their work and the postfeminist gender regime. Successful maneuvering enables the use of more radical change strategies than postfeminism otherwise allows. Practitioners' ability to maneuver rests on their critical reflexivity, which in turn is conditioned by their knowledge of gender and power dynamics. The study thus points to the centrality of selecting highly qualified individuals as gender equality practitioners.

TI Understanding Gender Equality Policy and Practice Gaps Through the Lens
   of Organisational Justice: Development of an Employee Alignment Model
SO FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
AB Policies and actions to address gender inequalities are widespread across a range of institutional and organisational contexts. Concerns have been raised about the efficacy and impacts of such measures in the absence of sustained evaluation of these activities. It has been proposed that important contextual factors may propel or inhibit measures to promote gender equality, including a critical mass of women, role models, diverse leaders and inclusive organisational cultures. This paper explores relationships between organisational justice and equality interventions to better understand gaps between equality policies and practices using a comparative case study approach in a male-dominated sector. A combination of questionnaire and interview data analysis with employees in three case organisations in the construction sector are used to outline links between perceptions of gender equality initiatives and organisational justice, and the mechanisms used to reinforce in-group dominance. The findings culminate in the development of an Employee Alignment Model and a discussion of how this relates to the organisational climate for gender equality work. The findings suggest that the development of interactional organisational justice is an important precursor for successful gender equality interventions in organisations. These findings have implications for those looking to minimize unintentional harm of policies or interventions to improve gender equality.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death globally and is increasing in many countries across the world. Gender inequality has been demonstrated to be predictive of suicide. However, scholars have argued over the direction of gender inequality's impact on suicide. Using the gender inequality index the results indicate that as countries become more equal, the suicide rate increases for males and females. Furthermore, the findings illustrate that as female educational levels and female labor force participation increase, suicide increases. These findings provide support for the status integration theory of suicide.

SO CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND
   INTERNATIONAL LAW
SE Cambridge Law Handbooks
AB Although Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, Gender Equality, references many international law provisions and principles on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, nevertheless, like their precursor, the 2000 Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs do not integrate gender as a cross-cutting issue across all the SDGs. The adoption of the gender mainstreaming approach endorsed by the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action during the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995 compromises the implementation of SDG 5. This chapter argues that by adopting a formalist approach to equality, SDG 5 does not fully recognize the differences among women - differences of class, race, disabilities, ethnicities, nationalities, religion, and those brought about by colonialism - and thus falls victim to the classical criticism of international law's genderedness and essentialism.

SO MEDIJSKE STUDIJE-MEDIA STUDIES
AB Over the last decades several achievements have emerged in Nordic state societies concerning gender equality, particularly with regard to political representation, salaries, and shared parental leave. In most newsrooms one may find a near equal distribution of women and men working alongside one another. Additionally, in the larger newsrooms of Sweden, there is a gender balance at the managerial level. Yet in terms of news content, women remain a minority. By using qualitative and quantitative data from two projects, The Global Media Monitoring Project and The Global Status of Women in the News Media, this article assesses some of the challenges and best practice solutions for gender equality in Scandinavian newsrooms. The major gender discrepancies between newsrooms can often be explained by the level of gender awareness at the societal-level. Further, capable leadership, policies, and gender monitoring seem to benefit a gender balance in the news. National legislation on parental leave and discrimination, additionally, appear to play a key role in creating gender equality in the newsroom.

   countries
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare and societies, exacerbating existing inequalities for women and girls across every sphere. Our study explores health system responses to gender equality goals during the COVID-19 pandemic and inclusion in future policies. MethodsWe apply a qualitative comparative approach, drawing on secondary sources and expert information; the data was collected from March-July 2022. Australia, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the USA were selected, reflecting upper-middle and high-income countries with established public health and gender policies but different types of healthcare systems and epidemiological and geo-political conditions. Three sub-goals of SDG5 were analyzed: maternity care/reproductive health, gender-based violence, and gender equality/women's leadership. ResultsWe found similar trends across countries. Pandemic policies strongly cut into women's health, constrained prevention and support services, and weakened reproductive rights, while essential maternity care services were kept open. Intersecting gender inequalities were reinforced, sexual violence increased and women's leadership was weak. All healthcare systems failed to protect women's health and essential public health targets. Yet there were relevant differences in the responses to increased violence and reproductive rights, ranging from some support measures in Australia to an abortion ban in the US. ConclusionsOur study highlights a need for revising pandemic policies through a feminist lens.

TI Capabilities-based gender equality analysis of educational policy-making
   and reform in Turkey
SO GENDER AND EDUCATION
AB This research aims to scrutinise the latest education reform and education policies in Turkey from a capabilities-based gender equality perspective. The data draws on interviews with stakeholders and practitioners to understand how gender equality is conceptualised in policy-making and to what extent reforms have fostered gender equality in girls' education. From a policy-making perspective, the data shows that reform has been successful in terms of a tangible, measurable outcome of an increase in enrolment rates. This can be attributed to a boost in the number of religious schools and the introduction of single-sex education featuring a limited conceptual understanding of gender equality, with a focus on closing the gender gap. However, from the practitioners' perspective, little concern has been given to gender equality and constrained girls' capabilities. The paper fleshes out the tensions between policy-makers and practitioners by highlighting the need for a comprehensive and inclusive understanding of gender equality in educational policy-making and developing a capabilities-based gender equality policy that is able to dismantle conservative and gendered structures and accommodate boys.

   THOUGHT
AB Known as the early 20th century Malay-Muslim scholar, Syed Syeikh Ahmad al-Hadi (1867-1934) has written several works concerning women's issues; including Faridah Hanom, Hikayat Anak Dara Ghasan, Hikayat Puteri Nurul'Ain, Kitab Alam Perempuan and many others. The present study attempts to examine his thought on the emancipation of women and gender equality, since not many Malay scholars focus on a similar issue during his time. This paper discusses on the development of his idea through magazines and novels since the 1920s, which later gave impact to the Malay society from cultural, social, political as well as religious aspects. This study also highlights several factors which might influenced his thought by discovering his educational background and analysing his different methods of arguments applied in his writings. By using qualitative approach, the study concludes that Syed Syeikh Ahmad al-Hadi has integrated both Islamic and modern perspectives in his writings, particularly concerning women's issues such as on the emancipation of women and gender equality. Although some of his ideas seem controversial, it was among the earliest effort to propose a change to Malay traditions, where women were often given a limited role in society, for they only had major roles in domestic affairs.

TI Foreign Aid, Norm Diffusion, and Local Support for Gender Equality:
   Comparing Evidence from the World Bank and China's Aid Projects in
   Africa
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Does foreign aid change local attitudes toward gender equality? Drawing on a theory of norm diffusion through intervention, we contend that when donors integrate norms into aid projects, such norms can be diffused to individuals in recipient countries. The World Bank and China are two comparable donors to examine this relationship. We matched the geocoded aid projects of the two donors from AidData and Afrobarometer surveys in Africa to test our hypotheses. Our strategy is to compare respondents' attitudes toward gender equality who were near a site where the project had been implemented at the time of the interview to those who were close to a site where the project would be started after the interview. We find that the World Bank aid increases local support for gender equality and the results differ across sectors and gender. Aid going to gender-sensitive sectors has the most significant impact on women's attitudes toward gender equality. In contrast, Chinese aid shows no similar effects. This study sheds light on the linkage between aid and social norm change and is expected to exert implications for policymakers and development practitioners adventuring in the land of aid.

TI Fostering collaborative approaches to gender equality interventions in
   higher education and research: the case of transnational and
   multi-institutional communities of practice
SO JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB Higher education and research and innovation in Europe continue to suffer from an indefensible waste of female talent and gender inequality. The European Commission recommends that these organizations adopt gender equality plans (GEPs) and other initiatives for institutional change. However, the levels of readiness, expertise, and experience with such interventions are wide-ranging across institutions and member states, thus collaborative approaches might be particularly valuable. Drawing on the experiences of transnational and multi-institutional communities of practice (CoPs) for gender equality (GE), we illuminate how the CoP approach supported change agents, who leveraged CoP membership to respond to challenges in promoting GE initiatives. Being part of collaborative, co-designed CoPs for learning, knowledge sharing, and institutional change provided external support to the change agents' activism and allowed them to build legitimacy around GE work. CoP members leveraged this support through learning opportunities, knowledge transfer, sharing practice, political support, and solidarity from the CoP stakeholders. Findings also show that when CoPs were transnational, multi-institutional, and interdisciplinary, their heterogeneity did raise some challenges in relation to the divergence of members' contexts and geopolitical idiosyncrasies and that this should be considered when designing CoPs which transcend national and institutional boundaries.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB This study examines relationships between family-supportive supervisor behaviour (FSSB) and individuals' prosocial and extrinsic motivation at work in four countries: Brazil, Kenya, the Netherlands and the Philippines. With a sample of 2046 employees from these four countries, we use national levels of gender inequality, measured by the United Nations Gender Inequality Index (GII), to examine whether differences in men's and women's achievements in society moderate the relationship between FSSB and individuals' motivation at work. The study reveals that FSSB is positively associated with prosocial motivation and extrinsic motivation, and that the level of gender inequality in a country is relevant, given that GII moderates the effects of FSSB on prosocial motivation. Our results show that when Gil is low, the positive effects of FSSB on prosocial motivation are stronger. We discuss the implications for theory and practice.

   conditional cash transfer program in Chiapas, Mexico
SO CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
AB This article examines the gender equality component of Prospera, a conditional cash transfer program in Mexico that provides cash contingent on three nodes of civic engagement: health, nutrition, and education. This article draws on ethnographic research in La Gloria, a settlement of indigenous Mayan refugees from Guatemala in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The article identifies the Prospera program's neoliberal features, the impact its gender equality measures have in the lives of women, their families, and in the political structure of the community of La Gloria. The findings reveal how Prospera reinforces gender and racial hierarchy, and fosters community divisions that undercut efforts to promote community autonomy, which raises questions about the ability of conditional cash transfers to promote development and gender equality in indigenous communities in Mexico.

TI DOES SEDENTARIZATION PROMOTE GENDER INEQUALITY - A CASE-STUDY FROM THE
   KALAHARI
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
AB Sedentarization has been implicated in the reduction of gender equality in some spheres of formerly nomadic Ju/'hoansi (!Kung) and Nharo Basarwa (Bushmen) life. Concomitant with the shift to sedentism, both the Ju/'hoansi and Nharo have undergone significant economic transformations, and these have been accompanied by changes in attitudes towards gender. Gender equality is examined among the Central Kalahari Basarwa who inhabit Kutse, a sedentary community in which economic change and the adoption of neighbouring people's attitudes have not been as widespread as elsewhere. Qualitative and quantitative studies show that gender egalitarianism is still quite strong at Kutse. It is suggested that not all foragers who become sedentary also become less egalitarian. Instead, the adoption of the economics and attitudes towards gender from non-foraging neighbours facilitates the emergence of gender inequality in those Basarwa societies formerly noted for their egalitarianism. Some current development programmes designed by Westerners exclude women and contribute to the increase in gender inequality which is emerging in these societies.

TI Gender (In)equality in English Textbooks in the Philippines: A Critical
   Discourse Analysis
SO SEXUALITY & CULTURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
AB Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines the representations of gender relations in a popular English textbook series used in primary schools in the Philippines, which is a highly-ranked country in global gender equality indices. It seeks to analyse the persistence of gender inequality in textbooks in a context that is fairly favourable for the promotion of gender equality. The findings indicate that overall gender inequality remains in favour of males. The persistence of male dominance overall despite demonstrable pro-women proclivities of the authors/editors may be a reflection of the enduring gender gap in the country, particularly in economic and political spheres. The implications are rather sobering. If achieving gender equality remains a challenge even among the highly-ranked countries like the Philippines, how much more is the case for over a hundred of lower-ranked countries?

AB On the basis of aggregated data from the most recent ISSP surveys and data from secondary sources, this paper analyzes a wide range of country-level indicators that reflect different dimensions of gender inequality and pertain to the economic position of women in different class situations. The findings reveal that indicators of gender inequality pertaining to women in different class positions are oppositely related to the scope and levels of family policy. Specifically, countries characterized by generous family policies tend to address gender equality among disadvantaged groups, while exhibiting an unequal pattern of gender inequality on indicators related to advantaged groups. By contrast, countries characterized by ungenerous family policies tend to advance equality on parameters related to advantaged groups but perform very poorly on parameters of gender inequality pertaining to disadvantaged groups.

TI Association between gender inequality and population-level health
   outcomes: Panel data analysis of organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) countries
SO ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB Background: Gender plays a well-recognized role in shaping health inequities. However, the population-level health consequences of gender inequalities have not been measured comprehensively. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between gender inequality and health indicators in organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.
   Methods: Ecological study based on 1990-2017 panel data for OECD member countries. Gender inequality was measured using the Gender Inequality Index (GII). The population health parameters evaluated were life expectancy (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and specific-cause mortality. Two-way fixed-effects linear models were used to assess the relationship between gender inequality and health outcomes. Models included potential mediating and confounding factors such as health spending, political model, and income inequalities.
   Findings: Greater gender inequality was associated with lower LE (-0.49%; CI95 -0.63%--0.31%;p-value < 0.0001), HALE (-0.47%; CI95 -0.63%--0.31%;p-value < 0.0001) and with increased premature mortality YLL (6.82%; CI95 3.63%-10.75%; p-value < 0.0001) and morbidity measured in DALYs (1.50%; CI95 0.48%-2.46%; p-value = 0.0028) and YLD (2.59%; CI95 0.67%-4.77%; p-value = 0.0063) for each 0.1 increments on the GII. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust to the various specifications of the causal models.
   Interpretation: Our results suggest that gender inequality pose a sizable impact on population health outcomes. Promoting gender equality as part of public policies is vital for optimizing health on a population scale. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Attention to gender equality in paramilitary organizations such as policing has increased in recent times following numerous reports identifying high levels of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and predatory behavior. It is well recognized that gender inequality will not be addressed without transforming the hierarchical and masculinized cultures of policing organizations. Less well recognized is the significance of situating and aligning gender equality reforms within a broader focus on organizational justice. This article illustrates this significance through reviewing key literature in the space of gender equality and policing and organizational justice and policing. It examines the ways in which gender equality reform has been approached in policing organizations with the aim of highlighting the possibilities and problematics of female-focused approaches and broader social justice approaches. The article's contribution is theoretical. It utilizes the social justice theorizing of Nancy Fraser to enrich insights from the organizational justice, gender equality, and policing literature to articulate a productive and comprehensive approach to addressing gender and other forms of injustice within policing organizations.

TI Gender equality in the Italian Recovery and Resilience Plan: the
   depoliticizing effects of the technocratic Draghi government
SO CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN POLITICS
AB The European Union considers gender equality to be a key issue for post-pandemic recovery. The establishment of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) required member states to present their National Recovery and Resilience Plans and commit themselves to considering gender equality a horizontal objective. As Italy's Recovery and Resilience Plan was, in terms of resources, the largest national plan under the RRF, it had the potential to be a 'turning point' for gender equality in Italy. This article offers a preliminary analysis, based on the categories elaborated by feminist policy research, aimed at assessing whether the National Plan initiated a process of policy and institutional change and if so, in what direction. It is argued that under pressure from the European vincolo esterno, the scope of gender equality has been narrowed and the measures aimed at promoting gender equality have become more bureaucratized and aligned with a managerial and technical policy turn, thus promoting a shift towards the depoliticization of gender equality.

TI BUDGETING FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN RESEARCH PERFORMING ORGANISATIONS
SO POLITICA ECONOMICA
AB Gender equality in research and innovation is one of the key priorities of the European Research Area and is part of the European Commission Gender Equality Strategy for 2020-2025 (European Commission, 2020). However, research performing organisations (RPOs) in Europe still show persistent gender inequalities with vertical (the glass ceiling phenomenon, with few women being able to reach the top of the ladder) and horizontal segregation (both with reference to the disciplines of research and teaching and in the choice of education fields) (European Commission, 2019a). This paper analyses inequalities in European RPOs and proposes strategies to reduce them. Can gender budgeting (GB) be a tool, along with other specific actions, in achieving gender equality? What key features should GB include to do so? To answer these questions, 25 GB examples from European RPOs were analysed, paying attention to the methodologies and the indicators that were used, and to their interaction with gender equality plans. Viable suggestions are put forward to improve the impact of GB on gender equality outcomes in RPOs.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB This article explores feminist resistance and resistance to feminism in gender equality planning in educational institutions in Finland. Focusing on feminist resistance signifies asking whether gender equality planning makes feminist resistance possible, and, if so, what does this resistance look like and what does it do? The article argues that feminist resistance is always intertwined with and in interplay with resistance to feminism. Analysing feminist resistance and resistance to feminism in gender equality work sheds light on the possibilities and challenges involved in transforming gender relations through this kind of work. It is suggested that this is a novel approach as much of feminist theorizing on the issue has focused on the neoliberal disciplining that gender equality planning results in. The theoretical framework for the analysis builds on Foucauldian notions of power and resistance where the two are conceptualized as deeply intertwined. The research material consists of personal interviews, group interviews and research notes taken during participation in the gender equality planning processes in one upper secondary school and one vocational institution.

TI Gender Equality Policies in Rwanda: Public Relations or Real
   Transformations?
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB This article examines Rwanda's gender equality policies with the intention of contributing to the ongoing debate in the literature on the meaning of gender equality initiatives in authoritarian states. The article evaluates the transformative potential of Rwanda's gender equality policies with reference to deep-rooted societal norms and practices within which gender inequalities are embedded. To this end, the article draws on in-depth interviews conducted in Rwanda with a range of stakeholders, as well as on documentary research. It explores the factors informing the Rwandan commitment to gender equality, and the positive developments this has brought about, before identifying five trends that threaten the transformative potential of Rwandan gender equality policies. The authors conclude that while a strong political will and target-driven policies offer opportunities for promoting gender equality, the transformative potential is jeopardized by the dominance of an underlying economic rationale; the neglect of the "invisible labour' of women; the formalistic implementation of gender policies and their focus on quantitative results; the limited scope for civil society voices to influence policy; and the lack of grassroots participation.

TI ACTING FOR GENDER EQUALITY: EVIDENCE, GAPS AND PROSPECTS FOR REAL CHANGE
   IN ECONOMIC POLICY
SO POLITICA ECONOMICA
AB Gender inequality in the access to the labour market and income distribution has increased as a consequence of the economic impacts of the global pandemic due to the higher presence of women employed in the economic sectors most vulnerable to lockdown and shutdown and with the least opportunity to continue to work remotely or from home. The risk of receiving lower income protection is higher for women due to their more discontinuous working profile and their higher presence in precarious jobs. Gender distribution of unpaid care and domestic work load is persistently unequal. Blindness on the gender impact of public policies designed in the emergence of first wave of the pandemic had the effect of deepening pre-existing gender inequalities showing that integration of gender analysis dissipates as the policy process develops leading to the evaporation of gender equality in economic policy making. Actions acknowledging the roots of gender inequalities together with the implementation of gender mainstreaming at all levels of economic policies are needed to revert this trend and to lead to a more gender equal society.

TI Analyses of the Cartoon Series from a Gender Equality Perspective: Pepee
SO EGITIM VE BILIM-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
AB Mass media play an important role in the formation and continuation of the concept of gender equality within society. The purpose of this research is to analyze and evaluate the cartoon series called "Pepee" according to the concept of gender equality. Presentation of gender roles through various educational tools in society is important in terms of the construction and formation of children's perspective about gender.
   This is a descriptive study utilizing a qualitative research design. The study sample which was analyzed was composed of 45 episodes of the Pepee cartoon series. Research data were analyzed both using the methods of content analyses and semiotics. It was revealed that both the female and male characters of this cartoon limited by gender roles in terms of stereotypes which are related to gender equality, actions, colors and the types of clothing and also it was revealed that it includes messages which mat reproduce sexist viewpoints. Based on the analyses, considering the findings in a holistic sense, it was observed that, the Pepee cartoons did contain messages of gender inequality.
   Analyses showed that even though many of the activities illustrated in the cartoon can be performed by both males or females, there were many activities, such as watering flowers, setting the table, and taking care of the baby, which were solely attributed to the female characters, while activities such as, driving a car, and riding a bicyde or a balloon were attributed to the male characters. Messages of gender inequality were identified in all episodes regarding such aspects as clothing colors, clothing types, emotional situations and the games played by the characters.
   All cartoons designed for educational purposes should involve episodic content and program scenarios to be in line with the principals of human rights and equality. All parts of the components of the societal system such as these cartoons have the responsibility in the society to prevent gender discrimination, as well as to promote gender equality awareness.

SO SPORT IN SOCIETY
AB Heteronormativity and the idea of binary sex constrain sport and exercise as well as many gender equality measures that are implemented in sport and exercise contexts. This strongly affects trans people's opportunities to participate. The purpose of the paper is to explore trans performativity in relation to gender equality efforts in sport and exercise. Through interviews with ten trans individuals, we untangle how trans is, in the words of Karen Barad, produced in and through agential intra-actions of multiple apparatuses of bodily production. Our diffractive analysis shows how meaning comes to matter in sport and exercise regarding what trans 'is,' who and how one can identify as 'trans,' and in what ways trans individuals experience inclusion and exclusion. The study demonstrates challenges with reconciling gender equality and trans inclusion in sport and exercise contexts given current conceptualizations of sport and exercise, gender equality, and trans.

TI How Long Should Parental Leave Be? Attitudes to Gender Equality, Family,
   and Work as Determinants of Women's and Men's Parental Leave in Sweden
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY ISSUES
AB A more equal division of parental leave use between parents has been a major political goal in Sweden for a long time, as it is assumed to lead to gender equality in the labor market, as well as in the homes. The assumed correlation between gender equality and shared parental leave has many aspects, but it has been investigated only in part. In this study, we investigate the determinants of men's and women's parental leave use with a focus on attitudes toward family, work, and gender equality. We use the Young Adult Panel Study with surveys conducted in 1999, 2003, and 2009. The findings indicate that gender equality orientation matters for parental leave for fathers. Mothers' parental leave length is primarily influenced by family orientation, whereas fathers' is influenced by the economic dimension of work.

AB In studying gender equality within the rural family setting we must take into account the social construction of both genders (male and female) manifested along the interaction between the sexes. Gender equality defines the principle goal of family and social development, in which the rights, responsibilities and personal growth of each individual is not influenced by being born male or female but by how they make the upmost use of their potential. The research aims to highlight the views of students from the Veterinary Medicine University of Bucharest on gender equality and equal opportunity between women and men in public and private life.
   The research findings revealed that most respondents, at a statement level, tend to assert that gender does not matter and that they fully uphold and promote gender equality. In reality, female students seek a greater gender equality, while male students claim traditional role prescriptions.

TI Gender equality in couples and self-rated health - A survey study
   evaluating measurements of gender equality and its impact on health
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB Background: Men and women have different patterns of health. These differences between the sexes present a challenge to the field of public health. The question why women experience more health problems than men despite their longevity has been discussed extensively, with both social and biological theories being offered as plausible explanations. In this article, we focus on how gender equality in a partnership might be associated with the respondents' perceptions of health.
   Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey with 1400 respondents. We measured gender equality using two different measures: 1) a self-reported gender equality index, and 2) a self-perceived gender equality question. The aim of comparison of the self-reported gender equality index with the self-perceived gender equality question was to reveal possible disagreements between the normative discourse on gender equality and daily practice in couple relationships. We then evaluated the association with health, measured as self-rated health (SRH). With SRH dichotomized into 'good' and 'poor', logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with the outcome. For the comparison between the self-reported gender equality index and self-perceived gender equality, kappa statistics were used.
   Results: Associations between gender equality and health found in this study vary with the type of gender equality measurement. Overall, we found little agreement between the self-reported gender equality index and self-perceived gender equality. Further, the patterns of agreement between self-perceived and self-reported gender equality were quite different for men and women: men perceived greater gender equality than they reported in the index, while women perceived less gender equality than they reported. The associations to health were depending on gender equality measurement used.
   Conclusions: Men and women perceive and report gender equality differently. This means that it is necessary not only to be conscious of the methods and measurements used to quantify men's and women's opinions of gender equality, but also to be aware of the implications for health outcomes.

TI Higher education as a platform for capacity building to address violence
   against women and promote gender equality: the Swedish example
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEWS
AB Violence against women is an acknowledged public and global health problem which has adverse consequences for women's health. Education, especially higher education, has long been identified as an important arena for addressing the problem and promoting gender equality. Two measures recently put in place in the Swedish higher education have brought the role of the sector into focus. The first is the inclusion of gender equality as a measurable outcome in quality assurance in higher education. The second measure is the amendment of the Swedish Higher Education Ordinance to include mandatory knowledge of VAW in the degree programme of seven selected relevant professional groups. The potentials of both measures to positively contribute to the gender equality discourse, as well as improving capacity building for the public health workforce who encounter VAW, are discussed.

In this introduction to our special issue, 'Workplace Gender Equality: Where are we now and where to next?', we examine the impact of the pandemic on women's employment, labour force participation, earnings, unpaid care work and experience of gendered violence. We identify five key areas where action is urgently required to create a more equitable post-pandemic recovery: addressing gender-based labour market segregations and discrimination; building access to mutually beneficial flexibility; ensuring a more gender-equitable distribution of unpaid care; confronting gender-based violence at work and beyond; and mobilising union action through gender equality bargaining.

TI How is the Illusio of Gender Equality in Entrepreneurship Sustained? A
   Bourdieusian Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB Studies of gender and entrepreneurship highlight the problematic emphasis of the gender equality discourse in entrepreneurship that ignores wider structural inequalities but provide a limited explanation of how the allure of this discourse is sustained. To address this lacuna, we draw on Bourdieu's theoretical ideas to theorize and demonstrate how certain women trade-off their capital endowments to compensate for gender inequality in entrepreneurship. Through an analysis of forty-nine biographical interviews with women entrepreneurs in London (UK), we show two forms that the 'illusio' of gender equality manifests: 'illusio of work-life balance', and 'illusio of meritocracy', and reveal how this doxic experience that escapes questioning and allows certain women to continue to play the game, entrenches the illusio of an entrepreneurial field free from gender bias. We thus illustrate the conditions of possibility and the various trade-off mechanisms through which gender inequality in entrepreneurship is reproduced or contested.

AB In Indonesia, since the majority of the workers in garment factory are females, they have a significant role on the succession of the factory. The gap between genders might create problems for female workers, which will lead to gender inequality at the workplace. This study aims to study the working conditions for the garment factories workers in Indonesia based on gender and to find out the causes of gender inequality in the factories during the period of 2012-2014. This is due to the empirical evidences which suggest that gender equality in the workplace is beneficial for the firm's performance, if managed properly. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative method was used to descriptively explain the data of the workers based on survey collected by Better Work. The qualitative method was utilized to review the literatures on barriers in the workplace for women both in Indonesia. It was discovered that there are some elements that influence the persistence of gender inequality in Indonesia.

   assessing impact
SO RESEARCH EVALUATION
AB The analysis of the reasons behind the persistent under-representation of women in senior positions in science is well-developed. In contrast, the assessment of the impact of policies addressing the problem suffers from a lack of evidence and an oversimplification of approaches. Based on the assessment of 125 programs for gender equality implemented in research organizations in Europe, North America, and Australia, we argue that holistic approaches and multidimensional frames of reference are needed for impact assessment, also to improve program design and policy. Our analysis shows that the problem of gender inequality is rooted in so many and interrelated factors that program impact assessment has to be multidimensional and complex. Having a conceptual approach grounded in the notion of complexity as a point of departure, the article presents an innovative impact assessment tool, pointing to effective ways to assess the impact of gender equality programs.

TI The Impact of Gender Quotas on Gender Equality in Sport Governance
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB A common intervention to address women's underrepresentation in governance has been the introduction of gender quotas. This study examined the impact of gender quotas on gender equality in governance among boards of National Sport Organizations (NSOs) in Australia. Central to the study was the theoretical concept of a gender regime. Part of a larger study, the research design comprised a comparative case study of five NSOs with data collected mainly through semistructured interviews with directors and CEOs. The findings suggest that a quota of a minimum of three women was a first condition to advance gender equality in governance. It needed to operate, however, in conjunction with other gender dynamics to move toward equal participation by men and women in board decision making. These included women in influential board positions, solidaristic emotional relations between men and women directors, and directors' adoption of gender equality as an organizational value.

AB Gender inequalities have persisted in Uganda's primary education regardless of specific interventions put in place to eliminate them. These include the implementation of Universal Primary Education in 1997. Research was carried out to understand the reasons for the persistence of these inequalities. This chapter highlights the nature of the various intersections that shape the background of direct and de facto discrimination upon which gender inequality thrives in a context of HIV/AIDS. Addressed are significant social dimensions with respect to rural education: class/wealth, age/generation and health/status of AIDS-affliction. I argue that HIV/AIDS affects all other categories thereby adding impressively to the magnitude and complexity of inequalities. Measures aimed at achieving gender equality in such a context should therefore not only broadly target girls or boys as a single category or gender dimension, but rather include specific interventions for those dimensions that cause subordination in various ways.

SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This research applied the analytical method proposed by Kaniklidou and House to examine power manipulation in existing translations of children's books that include gender equality issues in Taiwan. Fifty-one translations of gender-related picture books were analysed, and 411 instances of power manipulation phenomena were annotated. The study identified content explicitation and simplification as the most frequently used translation strategies, followed by cultural filtering, manipulation of ideology, sentimentalisation, infantilisation, and genre specificity. These categories overlapped and were closely related; instances of explicitation, cultural filtering, and ideological manipulation could occur in the same passage. The results of this study contribute to providing an objective basis for the development of gender equality education, and also serve as a reference for the translation industry, the government, and academia in enhancing or adjusting translation strategies, editing high-quality children's books, strengthening the foundation of children's language development, and promoting innovation and multi-faceted discussion.

TI Cultural dialogues in the good society - The case of honour killings in
   Sweden
SO ETHNICITIES
AB Value conflicts involving gender equality are interwoven into current multicultural tensions in many European societies. They are at the core of these tensions in Sweden, in which gender equality and principles of individual human rights constitute the state profile and political identity. In this article, we focus on three cases of honor killings that became flash points for public debates on 'culture and cultures' among political parties, immigrant groups and feminists in Sweden. The media fervor surrounding honour-related violence has provided xenophobic groups with political opportunities, but at the same time, the public debate has given visibility and opened up public space for immigrant women's groups. We conclude that the notion of the 'good society' has kept at bay the recognition of overtly xenophobic parties, but it has also inhibited open dialogue across and within majority and minority cultures, which would allow for reflections upon the diversity within cultures, marked by religion, gender, class differences and generational conflicts.

TI The effects of religion, superstition, and perceived gender inequality
   on the degree of suicide intent: A study of serious attempters in China
SO OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
AB Previous studies have tried to account for the uniqueness of gender ratios in Chinese suicide through physiological and psychological differences between men and women, and the means employed in the fatal act. From the point of view of the socio-psychological traits, this study examines the effects of religion (religiosity), superstition, and perceived gender inequality among Chinese women on the degree of their suicide intent. A four-page structured interviews were performed to the consecutively sampled serious attempters of suicide hospitalized to emergency rooms immediately after the suicidal act in Dalian areas, China. Both univariate analyses and the multiple regression model have found that the higher the degree the religiosity and superstition on metempsychosis, the stronger the suicide intent Chinese women had. The perceived gender inequality is positively correlated with suicide intent, and it is especially true for Chinese women. The socio-psychological traits and traditional Culture values and norms have important impacts on suicide patterns in Chinese societies.

TI Gender inequality across local wage hierarchies
SO WORK AND OCCUPATIONS
AB Is gender inequality more severe in higher paying jobs, where there is more at stake? Using a unique definition of jobs-local occupation-industry cells-and multilevel models, I offer the first investigation of how gender wage inequality varies as a function of a job's ranking in its specific local labor-market context. The results suggest that net of various individual- and job-level controls, (a)female-dominated jobs pay less than comparable male-dominated jobs, (b) the penalty associated with female-dominated jobs is steeper for women, and (c) wage inequality increases as one ascends the wage hierarchy of local labor markets. However, there is no evidence that the tendency for female-dominated jobs to pay less than comparable male-dominated jobs is stronger in high-ranking jobs. Taken together, the results are consistent with the exclusion of women from high-ranking jobs as well as gender segregation within local occupation-industry cells.

TI Frames in Contestation: Gendering Domestic Violence Policies in Five
   Central and Eastern European Countries
SO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AB The article looks at the translation of international norms on domestic violence to the national level in five Central and Eastern European countries. It argues that translation brings a concept of domestic violence, which stretches gender equality ideas underpinning international norms so as to be easier to endorse by mainstream policy actors, and results in policies framed in degendered individual rights terms. The potential for keeping gender equality in focus is then guaranteed by gendering policy processes through empowerment of gender equality actors at all stages. Absence of ownership of the policy by gender equality actors risks co-optation by frames contesting gender equality.

TI Revisiting gender equality at times of recession: a discussion of the
   strategies of gender and politics scholarship for dealing with equality
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER
AB The aim of this article is to explore the ways in which gender equality is used in gender and politics research. We contend that the political and theoretical relevance of studying the multiple meanings of gender equality is enhanced by current crises. We discern four strategies used in gender and politics research: (1) escaping equality; (2) fixing equality; (3) deconstructing equality; or (4) delegating equality to political theory. This article is motivated by the belief that what is needed is not only more reflection on these choices, but also a productive dialogue between the different strategies.

TI Gender Inequality Across the Academic Life Course
SO SOCIOLOGY COMPASS
AB Recent decades have witnessed increasing scholarly and public attention to the status of women in academia. Although women are now the majority of degree recipients and their share of initial academic appointments approximates their representation among degree recipients, substantial gender inequality persists. In this article, we review existing research on this topic, focusing on how gender inequality manifests and unfolds throughout the academic career life course, from graduate school experiences, through initial academic appointments, into the associate professor years, and, finally, to women's experiences as full professors and administrators. Throughout, we emphasize how institutionalized policies and subtle biases, rather than overt discrimination, perpetuate gender inequality. We conclude with suggested areas for future research.

   equality in the schools
SO AFRICA EDUCATION REVIEW
AB This paper gives prominence to rural teachers' own accounts of gender in three coeducational primary schools in Lesotho. The paper employs the social constructionist paradigm as its theoretical framework. Drawing from ethnographic data (observations and informal discussions), it discusses factors that inform teachers' constructions of gender and the implications of these on gender in/equality in the schools. Twelve teachers' (male = 1; female = 11) participated in the study. Analysis denotes how teachers constructed masculinities and femininities as inherent gender qualities, and the role of Basotho culture, language and its discourse in promoting gender inequalities. The conclusion provides strategies that would strengthen teachers' ability to promote gender equality in schools.

TI Help or Hindrance? Religion's Impact on Gender Inequality in Attitudes
   and Outcomes
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper investigates the effect of religiosity on attitudes toward gender equality using World Values Survey data. Results indicate that religiosity is strongly correlated with gender inequitable attitudes across countries. Further, OLS, TSLS, and 3SLS regression estimates reveal that gender inequitable attitudes are associated with negative effects on seven measures of gender equality of well-being and public policy. No single religion stands out as more gender inequitable than others. The impact of religiosity is likely transmitted via "stealth" effects on everyday behavior in economic transactions in labor markets, household resource allocation, and government spending.

SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES
AB Using Sen's capability approach and an aggregation methodology based on the fuzzy set approach, this article attempts to move beyond the main criticisms of the United Nations Development Programme indices for analysis of gender inequality. The Relative Women Disadvantage Index can be used to measure gender inequality in three domains (health, education, participation). It is complemented by the Women's Quality-of-Life Index, constructed from indicators that concern only women and children. However, these two indices are strongly correlated and seem to buttress the idea that the battle against gender inequalities is a condition for improving human development.

TI What COVID-19 revealed about gender equality policy framing
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on many areas of inequality. Despite its public commitment to gender equality, Australia's Morrison government has been accused of implementing economic stimulus policies in response to the pandemic that are often 'gender blind' and disadvantage women. This article examines both the Morrison government's gender equality policies and key criticisms of its economic measures. It argues that the government's claimed 'gender blindness' results not so much from an opposition to gender equality policy as from a particular neoliberal framing of it.

TI Uneven transitions: Period- and cohort-related changes in gender
   attitudes in China, 1995-2007
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB This paper analyzes temporal variations in two gender attitudes in China: beliefs about gender equality and perspectives on women's combined work and family roles. It uses the most currently available population series from the 1995, 2001 and 2007 World Value Surveys of 4500 respondents and a series of multilevel cross-classified models to properly estimate period and cohort effects. Attitudes toward women's dual roles manifest neither period nor cohort effects; the population displays a universal high level of acceptance of women's paid employment. Orientations toward gender equality manifest both cohort and period effects: members of the youngest cohort of both sexes hold the most liberal attitudes; the positive effect of college education has increased over time. Attitude toward gender equality in China displays neither a shift toward conservatism nor an over-time trend toward egalitarianism in 1995-2007, a time of rapid economic growth.

Some principles of a new institutionalism approach are applied for the examination of the development of gender equality machinery in the Baltic states since 1940. It is argued that since 1990/91, innovations in gender equality politics are related rather to the concept of gender equality than to the institutional machinery of gender equality policy.

TI Have Policies Tackled Gender Inequalities in Health? A Scoping Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Gender is recognized as one of the most relevant determinants of health inequalities. This scoping review sought to identify and analyse policies, either implemented or formulated as proposals, which aimed to reduce gender inequalities in health. We searched Medline, Web of Science, and Scielo. Of 2895 records, 91 full text articles were analysed, and 33 papers were included. Of these papers, 22 described the process of formulation, implementation, or evaluation of policies whose aim was to reduce gender inequalities in health; six focused on recommendations, and the remaining five dealt with both issues. Our review showed that the policies aimed at reducing gender inequalities in health, either implemented or formulated as proposals, are scarce. Moreover, despite some success, overall progress has been slow. The studies show failures in design and particularly in the implementation process. We found a lack of awareness and capacity in the policy-making progress, under-financing, bureaucratization, shortage of relevant data, and absence of women's participation in decision-making. Therefore, an emphasis on the design and implementation of gender-sensitive policies seems essential to advance gender equality in health. This scoping review gathers evidence to support the design of such policies and recommendations that can facilitate their implementation.

TI Country-level and individual-level predictors of men's support for
   gender equality in 42 countries
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Men sometimes withdraw support for gender equality movements when their higher gender status is threatened. Here, we expand the focus of this phenomenon by examining it cross-culturally, to test if both individual- and country-level variables predict men's collective action intentions to support gender equality. We tested a model in which men's zero-sum beliefs about gender predict reduced collective action intentions via an increase in hostile sexism. Because country-level gender equality may threaten men's higher gender status, we also examined whether the path from zero-sum beliefs to collective action intentions was stronger in countries higher in gender equality. Multilevel modeling on 6,734 men from 42 countries supported the individual-level mediation model, but found no evidence of moderation by country-level gender equality. Both country-level gender equality and individual-level zero-sum thinking independently predicted reductions in men's willingness to act collectively for gender equality.

TI Gender equality in Swedish AI policies. What's the problem represented
   to be?Palabras Clave(sic)(sic)(sic)
SO REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH
AB Over the past few decades, Sweden has established itself as a "world leader" in gender equality. Alongside this development, Swedish politicians have also initiated ambitious plans that aim to establish the country as "world class" in terms of digitalization. International research shows that women and racialized groups are in a minority in the design processes, that AI facial recognition systems are built with white male faces as the norm, and that digital tools replicate racial injustices. In this paper, we are interested in if, and if so how, gender equality is articulated and thus filled with meaning in national policies on AI and digitalization. The overall aim is to discuss the potential of gender (equality) mainstreaming to challenge systems of privilege in the implementation of AI systems in the public sector. The paper analyses how gender equality is filled with meaning in national policy documents on AI and gender equality. The main findings show that gender equality is turned into a question of lack of knowledge and information, which in turn blocks out an understanding of gender equality as something that is related to gendered power relations.

TI Overcoming gender inequality for climate resilient development
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Gender inequalities are reflected in differential vulnerability, and exposure to the hazards posed by climate change and addressing them is key to increase the adaptive capacities of societies. We provide trajectories of the Gender Inequality Index (GII) alongside the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), a scenario framework widely used in climate science. Here we find that rapid improvements in gender inequality are possible under a sustainable development scenario already in the near-term. The share of girls growing up in countries with the highest gender inequality could be reduced to about 24% in 2030 compared to about 70% today. Largely overcoming gender inequality as assessed in the GII would be within reach by mid-century. Under less optimistic scenarios, gender inequality may persist throughout the 21st century. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating gender in scenarios assessing future climate impacts and underscore the relevance of addressing gender inequalities in policies aiming to foster climate resilient development. Gender inequality increases vulnerability to climate change impacts and reduces societies' adaptive capacity. Here the authors show how gender inequality may evolve in the future in five scenarios of socioeconomic development and highlight the importance of incorporating gender inequality in climate change research and policy.

TI Analyzing gender inequality through large-scale Facebook advertising
   data
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Online social media are information resources that can have a transformative power in society. While the Web was envisioned as an equalizing force that allows everyone to access information, the digital divide prevents large amounts of people from being present online. Online social media, in particular, are prone to gender inequality, an important issue given the link between social media use and employment. Understanding gender inequality in social media is a challenging task due to the necessity of data sources that can provide large-scale measurements across multiple countries. Here, we show how the Facebook Gender Divide (FGD), a metric based on aggregated statistics of more than 1.4 billion users in 217 countries, explains various aspects of worldwide gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes gender equality indices in education, health, and economic opportunity. We find gender differences in network externalities that suggest that using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore, we find that low values of the FGD are associated with increases in economic gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks, while suffering evident gender imbalance, may lower the barriers that women have to access to informational resources and help to narrow the economic gender gap.

   mission possible?
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND WORK
AB This article deals with challenging the gender inequalities that exist in education and working life. It contemplates the kinds of discursive power relations that have led to gender equality work in Finland. In today's conditions where equality issues are being harnessed more strongly to serve the aims of economic efficiency and productivity, it is even more important to understand how people who actively seek change have succeeded in negotiating equality issues. The article also explores the current situation by conducting an analysis that makes clear not only the discursive power relations that shape gender equality work, but also how it has been possible for the work to continue successfully.

SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB The measurement of multidimensional gender inequality is an increasingly important topic that has very relevant policy applications and implications but which has not received much attention from the academic literature. In this paper I make a comprehensive and critical review of the indices proposed in recent years in order to systematise the different underlying ideas. I also present new gender inequality indices that overcome some limitations of the preceding ones. Using United Nations data, empirical results for the new indicators are provided, suggesting that the choice of one indicator or another can make an important difference for the ranking of those countries that have achieved high levels of gender equality.

SO POLICY AND POLITICS
AB The activation agenda, which increasingly informs social policies throughout Europe, also has significant gendered implications. This article focuses on the gender equality dimension of the European Employment Strategy (EES), the main process promoting the activation paradigm at the European Union (EU) level. It asks whether and how the strategy addresses the gendered effects of activation and promotes gender equality. Based on a comparative case study, the article argues that a continuous loss of visibility has significantly weakened the strategy's agenda-setting potential on gender issues and pushed gender equality to the fringes of the central EU project of social and economic modernisation.

TI Climate change and gender equality in developing states
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB It is commonly accepted that women can be more vulnerable than men to the adverse environmental effects of climate change. This paper evaluates whether the unequal distribution of costs women bear as a result of climate change are reflected across broader macro-social institutions to the detriment of gender equality and women's rights. It argues that gender disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect preexisting gender inequalities, they also reinforce them. Inequalities in the ownership and control of household assets and rising familial burdens due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain health and wellbeing. Consequences for gender equality include reductions in intra-household bargaining power, as women become less capable of generating independent revenue. Outside the home, norms of gender discrimination and gender imbalances in socio-economic status should increase as women are less able to participate in formal labor markets, join civil society organizations, or collectively mobilize for political change. The outcome of these processes can reduce a society's level of gender equality by increasing constraints on the advancement of laws and norms that promote co-equal status. I empirically test this relationship across a sample of developing states between 1981 and 2010. The findings suggest that climate shocks and climatic disasters exert a broadly negative impact on gender equality, as deviations from long-term mean temperatures and increasing incidence of climatological and hydro-meteorological disasters are associated with declines in women's economic and social rights. These effects appear to be most salient in states that are relatively less-democratic, with greater dependence on agriculture, and lower levels of economic development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Negotiating patriarchy? Exploring the ambiguities of the narratives on
   "male champions" of gender equality in Uganda Parliament
SO AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY
AB There is an emerging trend in which global development actors insist that gender equality programmes and initiatives must involve the participation of men, to the extent, in some cases, of calling for men and boys to empower women and girls. In Uganda, studies exist on how women gender activists have drawn on some men to speak to gender equity issues on their behalf. In some of these studies, supportive men are constituted as 'champions of gender equality', as if to express gratitude to and celebrate as unexpected, the significant role these men are seen to play in promoting gender equality. In this article, I draw on interviews with women gender activists in and outside Parliament and some male parliamentarians to explore how and why women opt for men to speak to gender issues on their behalf. I also examine ways in which men who are 'selected' to represent female voice on gender issues perceive and represent themselves with regard to promoting gender equality and their relationship with women and other men. The article specifically engages with concerns on whether gender inequalities are challenged or institutionalised through the use of male promoters of gender equality in Uganda Parliament and assesses the implications such manoeuvres have for thinking about gender and feminism, in particular African feminism.

TI Gender equality and macroeconomic outcomes: evidence and policy
   implications
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB A large and growing literature has associated gender equality with better macroeconomic outcomes. However, understanding the channels through which gender equality impacts the economy requires a deeper dive in the main constraints within an economy. Using theoretical and empirical evidence, we explore how gender equality in education feeds into higher human capital levels and thus better macroeconomic outcomes. We also analyse the impact of inequities in the labour market, focusing also on the role of the informal sector. Finally, we provide an overview on policy options to address various gender gaps.

TI Secular and Islamic feminist entrepreneurship in Turkey
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Purpose - This paper aims to highlight secular and Islamic feminist approaches to entrepreneurship as potential means to challenge gender inequality in the Turkish context. In Turkey, gender equality remains elusive in a nation where secular and Islamic ideologies compete and produce different solutions to ongoing economic, socio-cultural and political issues. Women's entrepreneurship has emerged as an important solution toward gender equality and economic development.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using two women's organizations that exemplify secular and Islamic feminist ideologies, the author examines whether the entrepreneurship activities they promote give way to challenging patriarchal norms, values and practices widespread in Turkish society.
   Findings - Through their distinct practices and engagement with entrepreneurship, both secular and Islamic feminist positions allow for praxis and represent an ethico-political commitment to dismantling neo-liberal development ideologies in the Turkish context that perpetuate gender inequality.
   Social implications - Secular and Islamic feminist practices and entrepreneurship practices have different implications for achieving gender equality including changes in gender norms, economic development policies and women's empowerment in a Muslim-majority country. In addition, it raises questions around the popular notion of " entrepreneurship as women's empowerment".
   Originality/value - This paper is of value to scholars who want to understand secular and Islamic feminisms and their implications for challenging gender inequality. The Turkish context with its traditional and modern societal norms and values provides a rich case study to examine these issues through the exemplars of entrepreneurship. It is also of value to scholars who want to understand structural constraints associated with gender equality beyond individual-level challenges.

AB Gender equality represents a central topic of our society, and its study is gaining increasing attention in the international panorama. During the last 20 years, various indicators aiming at measuring gender equality have been proposed, but there are no systematic experiences of indicators tailored for a subnational analysis. We propose a regionalization of the most complete and detailed gender equality indicator, the gender equality index (GEI) of the European Institute on Gender Equality, choosing Italy as a case study. The results show how a regionalized approach to gender equality is necessary to set priorities and target regional policy actions.

TI A Women's Rights-Based Approach to Reducing Child Mortality: Data from
   193 Countries Show that Gender Equality does Affect Under-five Child
   Mortality
SO MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL
AB Objectives Mother's health and wellbeing significantly affects child health. Women's autonomy can improve healthcare-seeking behaviour, utilisation of healthcare services, and planned pregnancy, thereby improving child health. The global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) has seen the fastest decline in the past two decades, but the influence of gender equality on child mortality remains unaddressed. A strategic approach addressing gender equality is needed to reduce the U5MR further. The study aimed to identify and investigate the association between indicators of gender equality and U5MR using a human rights-based approach. Methods We analysed open-source secondary data from international agencies comprising 521 gender-sensitive variables for 193 countries. Nine variables were included for the final Structural Equation Model based on the theoretical model. Model 1 consisted of 193 countries, and Model 2 comprised a subgroup analysis of 11 variables for 158 countries. Gender equality was a latent variable, and the U5MR was the outcome variable. Results Gender equality was significantly associated with U5MR (Z = - 7.47, 95% CI = - 754.67 to - 440.98, p < 0.001, n = 193 for Model 1, and Z = - 7.71, 95% CI = - 808.26 to - 480.72, p < 0.01, n = 158 for Model 2). Female education, women's waged and salaried employment, women as employers, and women's representation in leadership and parliament enhanced gender equality, whereas the prevalence of child marriage and intimate partner violence (IPV) negatively affected gender equality. Improvement in gender equality significantly reduced U5MR. Conclusions for practice Improving women's economic, educational, and social position and increasing female representation in higher leadership and policymaking positions is the key to reducing child mortality. Notably, eliminating child marriage and IPV is the key to achieving gender equality and is needed at the forefront of national policies. Gender equality can significantly improve women's reproductive autonomy, a critical factor in improving healthcare utilisation for women and their children.

TI Global Trends Impacting Gender Equality in Energy Access
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Achieving a just and equitable transition to a sustainable energy system will rest on efforts to address gender inequality. Women in developing countries are impacted by energy poverty in far greater numbers than men, and they do not have the same opportunities as men to take advantage of emerging opportunities that can help deliver energy access for marginalised populations. This article, geared to policymakers, brings attention to six global trends - decentralisation of energy services, affordability, mobile payments, women's entrepreneurship, urbanisation, and humanitarian settings. Achieving energy access for all, as called for under Sustainable Development Goal 7, will require attention to the ways in which these trends drive or hamper gender equality in energy access.

TI Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025: First Steps towards a Practical
   Implementation
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
AB In December 2019, Ursula von der Leyen was elected a new President of the European Commission, who commenced to promote the agenda for advancing gender equality. The Gender Equality Strategy 2020.2025 was presented in March 2020 by the European Commission. It aims at achieving a gender equal Europe by eliminating gender-based violence, sex discrimination and structural inequality between women and men. The implementation of this strategy will be based on a dual approach of targeted measures to accomplish gender equality, combined with the gender mainstreaming and the principle of intersectionality. The author touches upon a set of key actions of gender policy designated in the relevant paper. In addition, this article reveals disputes between the EU Member States regarding the concept of gender equality. In particular, it refers to Poland and Hungary, which have become the "non-aligned movement's" leaders regarding the EU-wide gender policy. The purpose of the study is to examine strategic areas of the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025. The article also highlights the impact of the EU's gender agenda on the Western Balkan countries under the enlargement policy. It primarily refers to the candidate countries (Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia) which are conducting EU accession negotiations.

TI Social Perceptions of Gender Differences and the Subjective Significance
   of the Gender Inequality Issue
SO PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART
AB Background. Gender inequality continues to reproduce itself in hidden and ambivalent forms and leads to invisible barriers in women's careers and lives. The authors were interested in how social perceptions of gender differences would relate to the maintenance of gender inequality in various spheres of life.
   Objective. The purpose of the presented research was to study social perceptions of gender differences in relation to the subjective significance of the gender inequality issue.
   Design. The study was conducted via an online survey throughout February-September of 2019. The sample included 106 people aged 18 to 68 (M = 30.2, s = 10.5), 49% of respondents were women. The authors have developed and tested a questionnaire assessing the adherence to ideas regarding evident gender differences in various spheres of life. The reliability of all scales of the questionnaire has been tested. Respondents also completed a questionnaire identifying their perceptions of gender inequality and shared their life experience with respect to this phenomenon in the form of free description.
   Results. The following two latent factors reflecting different aspects of gender perceptions have been identified: "Career Inequality" and "Differences in Social Spheres". Indicators of the subjective significance of gender inequality (which include gender awareness, frequency of gender inequality witnessing, personal experience of gender discrimination and the emotional significance of this experience) were positively correlated with perceptions of career inequalities (these support ideas regarding gender differences when it comes to opportunities for professional realization) and negatively correlated with perceptions of differences within social spheres (these support ideas regarding the existence of essential gender differences within the family, politics and everyday life).
   Conclusion. Articulation of personal experiences of gender inequality is associated with social perceptions of the absence of essential gender differences in various social domains (egalitarianism) and sensitivity to gender inequality with regards to career opportunities.

TI The Association between Childhood Immunization and Gender Inequality: A
   Multi-Country Ecological Analysis of Zero-Dose DTP Prevalence and DTP3
   Immunization Coverage
SO VACCINES
AB This study explores the association between childhood immunization and gender inequality at the national level. Data for the study include annual country-level estimates of immunization among children aged 12-23 months, indicators of gender inequality, and associated factors for up to 165 countries from 2010-2019. The study examined the association between gender inequality, as measured by the gender development index and the gender inequality index, and two key outcomes: prevalence of children who received no doses of the DTP vaccine (zero-dose children) and children who received the third dose of the DTP vaccine (DTP3 coverage). Unadjusted and adjusted fractional logit regression models were used to identify the association between immunization and gender inequality. Gender inequality, as measured by the Gender Development Index, was positively and significantly associated with the proportion of zero-dose children (high inequality AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.13-2.30). Consistently, full DTP3 immunization was negatively and significantly associated with gender inequality (high inequality AOR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.86). These associations were robust to the use of an alternative gender inequality measure (the Gender Inequality Index) and were consistent across a range of model specifications controlling for demographic, economic, education, and health-related factors. Gender inequality at the national level is predictive of childhood immunization coverage, highlighting that addressing gender barriers is imperative to achieve universal coverage in immunization and to ensure that no child is left behind in routine vaccination.

TI Exploring the possibilities of gender equality pedagogy in an era of
   marketization
SO GENDER AND EDUCATION
AB In this article, we research and revisit our own experiences of gender equality work to determine the societal and discursive power relations that have shaped gender equality. We conducted our study in Finland, a Nordic model of gender equality', but we argue that these results have worldwide relevance, especially since Nordic models of gender equality and education have been exported globally. By combining earlier research, our own extensive experience of conducting gender equality work, and previous literature on feminist pedagogy, we examine the possibilities of what we call gender equality pedagogy' in an era of marketization. To develop the concept of gender equality pedagogy, we ask how combining an analysis of gender equality work with feminist pedagogy can help to acknowledge and utilize power relations. We suggest that understanding gender equality work as a form of pedagogic practice might help overcome some of the barriers that gender equality work has encountered for decades.

TI Discourse Analysis of Gender Equality and Non-discrimination Laws and
   Strategies
SO TEMIDA
AB Based on the contemporary research on gender and language, using the method of discourse analysis applied to the laws and policies, this article explains how certain linguistic practice, in the context of the administrative discourse, produces meaning that may or may not contribute to its better understanding and more efficient implementation. Through discourse analysis of gender equality and non-discrimination laws and strategies in Serbia, it has been shown how and with what consequences the socio-political and academic elites affect defining and promoting certain concepts (gender, sex, gender equality, discrimination) in one social and historical moment. The paper is placed in the theoretical framework of three visions of gender equality: perspective of equal treatment, women's perspectives and gender perspective (Booth, Bennett 2002), that are corresponding to the three strategies for achieving gender equality: equal treatment, specific policy of gender equality and gender mainstreaming (Verloo, 2001).
   The discourse analysis of the Law on Gender Equality (2009), the National Strategy for the Improvement of the Position of Women and Advancement of Gender Equality (2009), the Law on Prohibition of Discrimination (2009) and the Strategy for Prevention and Protection against Discrimination (2013), has shown the context of use and meaning of terms gender and sex, as well as implications it has on their potential to change the existing paradigms and understanding of gender equality, and the implementation of policies in Serbia. Analysis of the use of terms sex and gender in the most important legal and strategic documents for achieving gender equality, showed that the choice of certain categories and terms is always a political choice. The authors show how these documents are written in the key of two gender perspectives and strategies: equal treatment and the specific policy of gender equality, while the third introduction of a gender perspective and gender mainstreaming is almost not mentioned, although it is consider to have the greatest potential for transformation of existing patterns of power and hierarchy in society (Booth, Bennett, 2002; Verloo 2005; Walby, 2011). While it is clear that neither laws nor strategies can reflect the complete corpus of knowledge and ideology of gender equality and feminist theory, it is essential that they, at the discourse level, act as a source of new knowledge and understanding of these concepts. Better connection between these documents and the contemporary feminist theory, the use of knowledge accumulated within gender studies, as well as their consistent linguistic and terminological compatibility and innovation, would contribute to a better understanding of concepts, terminology and knowledge of gender equality among the general public.

TI Beyond the gender pay gap
SO CONVERGENCIA-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
AB Gender inequality, and in particular wage gender inequality, has been considered a political priority in many countries over the last decades, with the focus centered on reducing the so-called gender pay gap, i.e., looking for a mean-convergence. However, approaching gender averages does not imply fairer (total and gender) wage distributions. Using microdata from a nationally representative sample of Spain's working population (N=216,769), we decompose total wage inequality into females and males' wage inequality (within groups) and gender inequality (between groups) and explore the extent to which these depend on those labor characteristics previously identified as determinants of the average differences between men and women ("gender pay gap"). For this dataset, the analyses show that gender wage inequality is higher than total wage inequality and both, total and gender wage inequalities, increase with a worker's age and education attainment.

Our research confirms that gender inequality is a phenomenon with a long history, but whose patterns can be analyzed and quantified on a larger scale than previously thought possible. Through the use of Inglehart-Welzel cultural clusters, we show that gender inequality can be analyzed with regard to world's cultures. We also show a steadily improving trend in the coverage of women and other genders in reference works.

TI The annihilation of femininity in Mao's China: Gender inequality of
   sent-down youth during the Cultural Revolution
SO CHINA INFORMATION
AB During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Mao's famous political slogan 'The times have changed, men and women are the same' asserted that men and women were equal in political consciousness and physical strength. However, the slogan's seeming emphasis on gender equality misconstrued the concepts of equality and sameness. In-depth interviews with former 'sent-down' youth illustrate how state rhetoric appropriated a discourse of women's equality to silence women and depoliticize gender as a political category. For urban sent-down youth, gender inequality was absent from public discourse, and conflict between the sexes was concealed by a state discourse that constructed class struggle as paramount. Gender as a category was credited with solely political and pragmatic meaning and was utilized as a means for the communist government to achieve its own political and cultural utopia.

The text begins with an appraisal of the general situation of women, both in Spain and Europe. Secondly, a reflection is made, about the evolution and significance of public sports practice, as well as elite practising at Spanish level. Afterwards, a series of changes are proposed to apply to Physical Education, town planning, administrative structures and elite sports regulation, with the aim of advancing towards effective equality between men and women in these areas. Finally, the text concludes with a reflection about the current impact of sport as a social phenomenon and its cultural potential as a way of generate positive values regarding gender equality.

TI International Obligations and Internal Tensions: Individual Religious
   Autonomy and Gender Equality in Russia and Central Asia
SO REVIEW OF FAITH & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB There are strong geographic patterns in how people view religion, national identity, minorities, and key social issues across different regions. These patterns also exhibit themselves in the ways that freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) and gender equality are viewed. This article focuses on gender equality in Central Asia and Russia and analyzes the international human rights treaty monitoring cycles within the United Nations. It also reflects on selected cases in the treaty committees. This article combines legal, human rights perspectives with current social research to identify deficiencies in states' fulfillment of their positive duties under international law to address the intersections between gender-based discrimination and religion. It employs the concept of intersectional discrimination to analyze these connections. The connection between FoRB and gender equality from the perspective of intersectional discrimination has not been sufficiently researched in relation to Central Asia and Russia. The treaty monitoring documents are a good starting point for this research and give a comprehensive picture of existing legal issues and underlying social problems.

   Defensive Institutional Work in Flemish Universities
SO GENDER & SOCIETY
AB Although a large number of studies have explored the main causes of gender inequality in academia, less attention has been given to the processes underlying the failure of gender equality initiatives to enhance gender representation, especially at the professorial level. We offer a critical discourse analysis of recently promulgated gender policy documents of the five Flemish universities, and demonstrate that defensive institutional work is a fundamental process underlying resistance to gender equality in the academic profession. That is, powerful organizational actors resist gender change by (un)intentionally deploying a combination of discursive strategies that legitimate what we describe as non-time-bound gender equality initiatives: The expected outcomes are undetermined in time, and they delegitimate concrete, time-bound measures that define specific outcomes against well-defined deadlines. By explicitly bringing a temporal dimension into our analysis, we argue that defensive institutional work deflects questions regarding what ought to be achieved when, and contributes to the slow pace of gender change in academia.

TI WE WANT BUT WE CAN'T: GENDER (IN)EQUALITY IN THE SPANISH PUBLIC
   UNIVERSITIES
SO CONTEXTOS EDUCATIVOS-REVISTA DE EDUCACION
AB First, this paper analyzes the gender gaps in the Spanish public universities as a reflection of social inequality, with data on the university community. Second, within the changes in the Spanish laws since the first decade of the 21st century, we propose the evaluation of a series of measures associated with gender equality policies. Gender equality plans and gender equality units, or the formation of governing teams following a balanced presence criterion don't have a high cost for universities and public administrations when there is intellectual capital as well. The result of this analysis will point the existence (or not) of institutional will to materialize the compromise to reach equality between women and men.

TI Do Development and Democracy Positively Affect Gender Equality in
   Cabinets?
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB It has been argued that economic development and democracy create new opportunities and resources for women to access political power, which should increase gender equality in politics. However, empirical evidence from previous research that supports this argument is mixed. The contribution of this study is to expand the research on gender equality in politics through an in-depth examination of the effect of development and democracy on gender equality in cabinets. This has been completed through separate analyses that include most of the countries in the world across three levels of development (least-developed, developing, and developed) and across different types of political regimes (democracies, royal dictatorships, military dictatorships, and civilian dictatorships). The results demonstrate that economic development and democracy only affect gender equality in cabinets positively in a few environments. Accordingly, the context is important and there seem to be thresholds before development and democracy have any effect. Development has a positive effect in developed countries and in democracies, but it has a negative effect in dictatorships, and the negative effect is strongest in military dictatorships. The level of democracy has a positive effect mainly in dictatorships, and the strongest effect is in civilian dictatorships. The article demonstrates the importance of dividing samples into subsets to increase understanding of what affects women's representation in cabinets in different environments, and I ask scholars to subset samples and run separate analyses more often in comparative studies.

AB Purpose- This study aims to analyse the present situation of gender inequality in the workplace in India, examine the legal provisions that address gender inequality in India and evaluate and assess the recommendations made to eliminate gender imbalance at workplaces in India.Design/methodology/approach- This study will adopt an exploratory research design to help identify and describe the most pressing problems and developments in the field. For this purpose, a secondary data collection approach is adopted. This study will acquire data through secondary means. This study will gather secondary data through the course of existing literature, judicial decisions and other authentic and published sources.Findings- Legislative and judicial efforts alone are not enough to achieve gender equality. The mindset of people, in general, has to change through awareness. Unless a law is supported by public opinion, it cannot achieve its goal.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is limited to gender inequality in the workplace only. In addition, the judicial perspective on gender disparity in India is examined in this paper. As a result, the findings cannot be applied to other situations.Originality/value- This study deals with gender inequality in the workplace from legal and judicial perspectives and discusses that social change can be brought only by enacting laws but by public awareness.

TI The Effect of Structural Gender Inequality Revealed in Small for
   Gestational Age
SO GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB Background This study proposes that being small for gestational age (SGA) is not only an important indicator for neonatal health but also could be a consequence of gender inequality. Low birth weight (LBW) has been widely used as a measurement for adverse birth outcomes, whereas much less attention has been given to the use of small for gestational age (SGA). Despite the importance and worldwide acknowledgement of promoting gender equality and women's empowerment to improve maternal and infant health, previous studies on SGA have focused on nutritional status, social and medical infrastructures, and socioeconomic status. The impact of structural violence against women on SGA has not been explored sufficiently. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of gender inequality on SGA, using the Gender Inequality Index (GII).
   Methods A total of 106 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from the most recent three global datasets-Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank-were assessed.
   Results Findings from generalized linear model analysis suggest that significant links exist between years of potential life lost (YLL) from SGA and gender inequality, maternal health status, and country level of income.
   Conclusions Our findings advance the understanding of the role of gender inequality on SGA and reiterate the importance of considering structural violence in maternal and infant health research. These associations can support the message of designing public health and socioeconomic development as well as creating campaigns to promote gender equality in efforts to advance maternal and infant health and to prevent adverse birth outcomes across the globe.

TI Care for Sick Children as a Proxy for Gender Equality in the Family
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Swedish parents are entitled to government paid benefits to take care of sick children. In this paper we show that the gender distribution of paid care for sick children is a good proxy for the gender division of household work. Using two examples we show that registry data on care for sick children is a useful data source for studies on gender equality in the family. Our first example shows that increased effort at work leads to a lower effort in household work, and a higher effort at home for the other spouse. Our second example provides some evidence for a pro-cyclical pattern in gender equality.

This is carried out through analyses of policy documents accessible on the companies' websites. The contents of the policies and their definitions of diversity are discussed in a context of gender equality and multiculturalism. The concluding results of the study indicate national differences in definitions and applications of diversity, but also, and more importantly, a similar tendency in all three countries to subordinate concerns for gender equality to concerns for diversity.

TI The limits of equality bargaining in the USA
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB Gender equality bargaining in the US is poorly understood and lacks analysis. Using existing theories of collective bargaining and gender equality bargaining, we examine the state and process of gender equality bargaining in the US as well as the contextual factors that facilitate or inhibit its development. Based on interviews with national labor union leaders, we find that the practice of gender equality bargaining among US unions is relatively narrow, largely because of the unique inhibitive characteristics of the US environment. Key factors making gender equality bargaining difficult include a lack of public policy support and decentralized bargaining structures. We also find that while most national unions have made an effort to put female leaders in positions of power, this is not necessarily mirrored at the local level. Our analysis also includes a discussion of union strategies for overcoming inhibitive contextual factors and taking maximum advantage of facilitative contextual factors.

TI Gender Inequalities and Social Sustainability. Can Modernization
   Diminish the Gender Gap in Political Knowledge?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The gender gap in political knowledge is a classical problem of Western democracies. In the 21st century, political knowledge is still unequally distributed between men and women, as many cross-section studies have shown. This is an indicator of women's disempowerment and the distance which remains to be covered to achieve an inclusive and sustainable society. Could public policies and gender equality laws change the situation? Using a longitudinal database in which 600,000 survey responses are analysed from 1996 to 2017, this case study of Spain aims to shed some light on this question. It combines sociological and political approaches in line with the development theory of the gender gap of Inglehart and Norris (2000, 2003), whose core argument is that modernization changes cultural attitudes toward gender equality. From this perspective, this paper proposes the following hypothesis: the modernization process of Spain (from a dictatorship to a democracy) has given rise to changes in traditional sex roles, driving women's access to political knowledge and diminishing the gender gap. This is a step towards achieving objective number 5 of the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development (gender equality and empowerment of women and girls), according to which gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.

TI Mitigating Gender Inequality in Rural Regions: The Effects of Tourism
   Employment in Namibia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH
AB We examine the effects of tourism employment on gender inequality in Namibia. We find that tourism contributes to local livelihoods by providing opportunities for cash income through employment, craft sales and shareholder profits from tourism enterprises. In general, male-headed households are economically better off. Female-headed households with tourism employment are better off than those without and are as equally well-off as male-headed households. We find no significant statistical difference between male-headed households with tourism employment and those without it. These findings suggest that tourism provides specific advantages for women and helps mitigate gender inequality in areas where tourism employment is available.

SO ENGINEERING STUDIES
AB Gender bias is important in our society not only from the point of view of ethics and human rights but also from a pragmatic engineering point of view. Universities are aware of this issue and develop equality plans, some of them including specific actions like education in gender equality. We ask, how effective are these actions? And, are there any differences in the perception of gender equality between social sciences/humanities and engineering university students? In order to answer these questions, a case study of the Spanish university system was carried out by comparing equality perception in the students of two universities: the Universidad de Valencia Estudio General and the Universitat Polit?cnica de Val?ncia. For this purpose, 338 questionnaires were filled in by university students and were processed in two academic years (2015/2016 and 2016/2017), and at two different moments: before (225) and after (113) receiving a gender equality course. Results show the main differences in gender perception among Engineering and Social Sciences students, and the importance of gender courses.

The results, based on a competing-risks loan hazard model, reveal that borrowers of different genders have different loan termination patterns. After controlling for the probability of a borrower defaulting or prepaying, female borrowers pay higher contract rates in the subprime mortgage market over the study period.

Tracing the interaction of employee activism with new managerialism over nearly two decades, four phases of change are identified. These provide a basis for generating two concepts - managerial recalibration and individual activism - while challenging the social abeyance hypothesis of social movements.

AB Although democratic institutions existed long before gender equality, at this point in history, growing emphasis on gender equality is a central component of the process of democratization. Support for gender equality is not just a consequence of democratization. It is part of a broad cultural change that is transforming industrialized societies and bringing growing mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. This article analyzes the role of changing mass attitudes in the spread of democratic institutions, using survey evidence from 70 societies containing 80 percent of the world's population. The evidence supports the conclusion that the process of modernization drives cultural change that encourage both the rise of women in public life, and the development of democratic institutions.

The study of the evolution of these indicators showcases the accentuation of structural differences that maintain and perpetuate gender inequality

TI Gender equality narratives, the right and democracy: developing a
   comparative tool from the case of the 2017 French Presidential election
SO FRENCH POLITICS
AB The increased use of gender equality appeals by right-wing parties, and the inclusion of "gender equality" among touted "European" or "liberal values," requires scholarly analysis. The variety of narratives available, and their differing policy consequences, make this research important, particularly in light of its politicization and potential to enhance, or undermine, the liberal aspects of modern democracy. This paper provides an original, two-dimensional tool with which to differentiate between gender equality narratives, based on comprehensiveness of policy proposals and the underlying individualist or communalist ontologies found in right-wing rhetoric. This tool is then used to examine the gender equality appeals made by right-wing candidates in the 2017 French Presidential elections. Campaign documents used by Francois Fillon, Marine Le Pen, and Alain Juppe were analyzed in order to understand how "new" right-wing narratives of gender equality differed from the "classical" gender equality narratives of the center and center-left. This case revealed the existence of four gender equality narratives used by these candidates-comprehensive, post-colonial, imminent threat, and essentialist. These narratives, and the comparative tool developed here, can be used in future research to examine right- and left-wing narratives of gender equality in other liberal democratic states.

TI Action Competence for Gender Equality as Sustainable Development:
   Analyzing Swedish Lower Secondary Level Textbooks in Biology, Civics,
   and Home and Consumer Studies
SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION REVIEW
AB Gender equality constitutes a central aspect of sustainable development. Education is commonly viewed as crucial for achieving both sustainable development and gender equality, and many argue that fostering action competence is a key element in such educational efforts. This article directs attention to the ways in which textbook content about sustainable development and gender equality may support and/or hinder the promotion of action competence. We analyze content about gender equality and sustainable development in Swedish lower secondary school textbooks in biology, civics, and home and consumer economics. We find that sustainable development and gender equality are organized as separate, rather than integrated, topics in textbooks. The analysis also shows that the social dimension, in particular, and multidimensionality, in general, of sustainable development are poorly described. Content about gender equality is furthermore marked by anthropocentric perspectives and weak historical contextualization. All of these traits, we argue, hinder rather than support how textbooks may promote action competence.

AB Media is critical for gender equality. I analyze Wikipedia, one of the prominent examples of new media. Using data from a survey and a randomized survey experiment, I study why women are less likely to contribute to Wikipedia, the implications of the gender gap on Wikipedia's content, and what can be done about it. I find that: (1) gender differences in the frequency of Wikipedia use and in beliefs about one's competence explain a large share of the gender gap in Wikipedia writing; (2) the gender gap among contributors leads to unequal coverage of topics; (3) providing information about gender inequality has a large effect on contributions.

SO POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS
AB Gender inequality in Russia's rural formal economy is examined using quantitative and qualitative data. Rural women continue to be underrepresented in farm managerial positions, and gendered income differences remain the norm. Rural women are underrepresented because they continue to have responsibility for most of the housework and child care. The traditional division of labor inside the household continues to dominate, thereby affecting women's career trajectories and earning potential. Value change about gendered roles in the formal economy has been minimal.

TI "It Is So Swedish That You Have to Work". Returning Swedish Migrant
   Women's Negotiations of Gender Equality and Heterosexuality
SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB Notions of gender equality are strongly linked to the Swedish self-image. This article explores returning Swedish migrant women's negotiations of heterosexual gender equality ideals based on their experiences of being housewives to middle- and upper-class men with work contracts abroad. From fieldwork conducted within two networks for returning Swedes, the article provides an analysis of the ways in which the women talk about work, gender equality, and domestic workers.The analysis of the women's accounts of gender relations shows that different ways of doing femininity are central in their narratives. By using the concepts emphasized femininity and gender-equal femininity the article highlights the different forms of femininity that can be traced in the women's narratives. Drawing from the empirical examples, it is shown that the women are troubled by Swedish gender equality ideals and express a feeling of not fitting in after returning to Sweden. I suggest that the women's articulations of not fitting in to (imagined) gender-equal Sweden tend to downplay the fact that they still have advantages that assist with fitting in from social positions such as class, whiteness, and (hetero)sexuality: positions which may create space for negotiating social norms in Sweden.

TI Gender equality and state aggression: The impact of domestic gender
   equality on state first use of force
SO INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
AB I examine the role of domestic gender equality in predicting whether or not a state is more aggressive in international disputes. This research adds to a growing body of feminist research in international relations, which demonstrates that states with higher levels of gender equality exhibit lower levels of violence during international disputes and during international crises. Many scholars have argued that a domestic environment of inequality and violence results in a greater likelihood of state use of violence internationally. This argument is most fully developed within feminist literature; however, research in the field of ethno-nationalism has also highlighted the negative impact of domestic discrimination and violence on state behavior at the international level. Using the MID data set and new data on first use of force, I test, using logistic regression, whether states with higher levels of gender equality are less likely to be aggressive when involved in international disputes, controlling for other possible causes of state use of force. Beyond this project's contribution to the conflict literature, this research expands feminist theory by further incorporating it into traditional international relations theory to deepen our understanding of the impact of domestic gender equality on state behavior internationally.

TI The impact of culture on small tourism businesses' access to finance:
   the moderating role of gender inequality
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB Access to finance to stay competitive is a salient challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Few studies examine how cultures (i.e. social norms and customs) in different countries influence various channels for SMEs' external financing (i.e. formal and informal). In particular, gender inequality, such as in terms of gender disparities in health, empowerment, and the labor market in each country, can bias lenders' perspectives of female SME owners. By incorporating pecking order, information cost, and lack-of-fit theories, this study uses the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset and other secondary datasets to investigate the impact of culture and gender inequality on tourism and hospitality SME owners' access to formal and informal financing. The results show that cultures that are more masculine than feminine encourage both formal and informal financing; however, cultures with high power distance boost informal financing and hinder formal financing. In addition, gender inequality moderates these cultural influences on access to finance. This study contributes to the SME literature and provides insights for governments and policymakers.

The two discourses relate differently to the nation so that gender equality is seen as inherent to the nation while multiculturalism is seen as a challenge posed from outside. Nevertheless, the two discourses are dependent upon each other and cite each other. The material for the analysis is a document produced by an NGO-based multicultural women's project in Finland. The article can also be read as a contribution to the debate over the compatibility between gender equality and multiculturalism through an analysis of how gender equality - as an ideology and as a set of practices - is deeply embedded in the production of otherness in the Finnish context.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND APPLIED CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB Studies examining gender inequality and crime have often explored the connection between female victimisation and crime. However, feminist theories do provide a rationale for gender inequality affecting all crime, not just female victimisation. Using the ameliorative and the backlash hypothesis the current analysis examined gender inequality and homicide in 94 countries. Using a gender inequality index, we found that as gender inequality increased the homicide rate increased. This finding supports the ameliorative hypothesis, which states that as societies become more equal crime will decrease.

TI From promoting gender equality to managing gender equality policy
SO INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB This article analyzes the depoliticizing effects of managerial public governance reforms on gender equality policy. It combines two dimensions of depoliticization: the denial of gendered power relations and the denial of political interests, ideologies, and related conflicts. The article focuses on a recent strategic governance reform in Finland, considering the context specificity of governance reforms as well as how they are connected to "management fashions." The article shows how the implementation of strategic governance has intensified ongoing shifts in the position, scope, and practices of gender equality policy. As a result, gender equality policy has been sidelined and instrumentalized to serve other government policy objectives; the scope of gender equality policy has been narrowed; and measures to promote gender equality have become increasingly aligned with the ideals and practices of managerial governance. The article argues that the two-dimensional process of depoliticization explains a "quiet backlash" against gender equality policy in a context of relatively strong gender equality policy and institutions. Such backlash does not involve open conflict between gender equality policy and conservative and/or anti-gender policies but is represented as a technical rather than a political shift.

TI A vision to advance gender equality within pharmacy leadership: Next
   steps to take the profession forward
SO RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 to 'achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls' aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and ensure their full and effective participation in all spheres of life. In alignment with this, several key international initiatives are making progress towards gender equality in the pharmacy profession. The pharmacy profession must support women and accelerate the progress of women in leadership positions in pharmacy. International and national pharmacy professional bodies can play a critical role in fostering the change required to improve gender equality in all regions and countries. The ongoing development, evaluation and implementation of policies and initiatives are critical to a profession that is increasingly becoming feminised. Furthermore, there is an imperative to deeply understand the gender-based barriers and develop evidence-based strategies and solutions to support women in pharmacy leadership. There is extensive literature and research on gender inequality and its impact on leadership outside pharmacy which could be used strategically for the profession to develop its own evidence based stra-tegic position. Robust initiatives are needed to ensure that women at all levels including women in pharmacy leadership are empowered and encouraged to participate in their profession. This commentary seeks to generate and contribute to the debate to ensure the profession is proactive and deliberate in tackling the challenges that have traditionally impeded women reaching leadership positions and several critical actions as next steps are proposed. Action is needed to improve gender equality in pharmacy leadership and a profession-wide discussion on ways to progress the above proposed actions is critically needed.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB Little is known about the impact of workplace gender equality initiatives in improving women's representation. We assess their effectiveness on levels of women's representation in Australian property and mining organizations. Derived from signaling theory, we propose and test a positive relationship between gender equality initiatives and women's representation at management and non-management levels. Derived from contingency theory, we propose and test the moderating effect of women in top management teams on the abovementioned relationships. The hypotheses were tested using archival data from 358 organizations with a 2-year time lag. The findings partially support the main and moderating effect hypotheses. We discuss theoretical, research, and practical implications.

TI Perceived gender inequality in the couple relationship and
   musculoskeletal pain in middle-aged women and men
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Aims: Musculoskeletal pain is a major health problem, especially in women, and is partially determined by psychosocial factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether gender inequality in the couple relationship was related to musculoskeletal pain. Methods: Participants (n=721; 364 women and 357 men) were all individuals living in a couple relationship in the Northern Swedish Cohort, a 26-year Swedish cohort study. Self-administered questionnaire data at age 42 years comprised perceived gender inequality in the couple relationship and musculoskeletal pain (in three locations, summarised into one score and median-split), concurrent demographic factors, psychological distress, and previous musculoskeletal pain at age 30 years. Associations were examined using logistic regression. Results: Gender inequality was positively associated with symptoms of musculoskeletal pain in the total sample, remaining significant after addition of possible confounders and of previous musculoskeletal pain. Separate adjustment for concurrent psychological distress attenuated the association but not below significance. The association was present and of comparable strength in both women and men. Conclusions: Gender inequality in the couple relationship might contribute to the experience of musculoskeletal pain in both women and men. The results highlight the potential adverse bodily consequences of living in unequal relationships.

TI Does Gender Equality Promote Social Trust? An Empirical Analysis
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Fairness is an important factor that promotes social trust by reducing social heterogeneity and gaps between people. This paper empirically investigates whether gender equality fairness between men and women increases social trust by analyzing a global sample from the World Values Survey. The findings show that gender discriminatory values negatively affect the trust levels of both men and women, while women's status in labor, education, and political dimensions is not a significant determinant. These results indicate that values regarding gender equality (fair values) are arguably more important to social trust than the actual socioeconomic conditions of women (fair conditions). Furthermore, the effect of gender equality varies across countries with different levels of gender endowments. Gender-related values are an important factor of social trust in countries where gender equality is relatively high, but its effect is minimal in countries with greater gender discrimination. This finding implies that fairness is a more essential social value in countries where equality is already established. Finally, the empirical investigation finds a stronger effect of gender equality on men than on women especially in high gender-equal countries. This result contradicts the initial expectation that gender equality influences women more significantly and thus, the effect should be larger for them. A possible explanation for this result is that gender equality establishes a more trustworthy environment of men which increases their trust level more. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Using Gender Knowledge More Effectively - Gender Equality Actors in the

SO FEMINISTISCHE STUDIEN
AB Due to changing governance and an increased demand for quality in gender politics, gender equality work in higher education experienced professionalization processes. This paper argues that the use of scientific gender knowledge plays a crucial role in further professionalization of gender equality practices. Two surveys presented in this paper one of them quantitative and the other qualitative point out that scientific gender knowledge is evaluated very differently by the questioned actors. As some of them are skeptical towards gender issues, these results may indicate the need for a defined minimum standard for the use of gender knowledge in gender equality work.

TI Implementing an Integrated Governance Strategy: The Quest for Gender
   Mainstreaming in Canada
SO AMERICAN REVIEW OF CANADIAN STUDIES
AB There is strong evidence that gender mainstreaming (GM), a gender equality governance strategy, is performing poorly across jurisdictions. While many national and regional governments have adopted gender equality policy tools, developing and implementing an integrated GM strategy requires substantive reforms to existing procedures and institutional settings. The goal of the article is to demonstrate that, in Canada, current gender equality policy using a gender-based analysis (GBA) approach does not feature the same governance arrangement as the alternative GM approach would entail. Using the Canadian federal government as a case study, the gender equality policy instrument mix is examined to demonstrate how different problem definitions result in suboptimal performance. The article concludes that Canada's current gender equality policy regime only advances the mainstreaming of GBA, and not the mainstreaming of gender equality in general.

TI Weak support for a U-shaped pattern between societal gender equality and
   fertility when comparing societies across time
SO DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
AB BACKGROUND
   A number of recent theories in demography suggest a U-shaped relationship between gender equality and fertility. Fertility is theorized to be high in societies with low levels of gender equality, as well as in societies with high gender equality, with lower fertility in a transition phase.
   OBJECTIVE
   This study estimates the relationship between gender equality (as operationalized through female political empowerment) and fertility within societies over time, using yearly information on gender equality and fertility for 35 countries.
   RESULTS
   When examining societies across time there is no evidence of a U-shaped relationship between gender equality and fertility. In cross-sectional analyses across countries for recent periods, such a U-shaped relationship can be observed. For within-society analyses a negative relationship is clear at lower levels of gender equality, while no pattern can be observed in societies with high gender equality.
   CONTRIBUTION
   Theories that fertility would increase following increasing gender equality are not supported for changes over time within countries. Implications and robustness of the findings are discussed.

SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB The strong presence of gender inequality in companies has been given great attention at an institutional and research level. In order to acknowledge organizations committed to eliminating this gender gap, a seal of distinction for equality in the workplace was created at an institutional level in Spain. Although this type of public recognition can improve gender equality in the workplace, the aim of this research is to study whether it also has a favorable impact on the financial performance of Spanish companies. To do so, the variation in financial performance has been analyzed before and after the concession of this distinction, taking into consideration its relationship with a series of economic and gender variables. The implementation of a panel data regression has shown that sales, worker efficiency, and how efficiently directors manage the company have a positive influence on financial performance in the period subsequent to institutional recognition for adopting equality measures in the workplace. In addition, if the person presiding the company is a woman, this implies a positive influence on financial performance.

TI How Public Displays of Heterosexual Identity Reflect and Reinforce
   Gender Stereotypes, Gender Differences, and Gender Inequality
SO SEX ROLES
AB Heterosexual marking occurs when people behave in ways that are interpreted by others as evidence of heterosexuality. In an exploratory comprehensive study of this phenomenon, we conducted 12 focus groups with 57 individuals: four groups composed of heterosexual women, four composed of heterosexual men, and four composed of mixed-gender sexual minorities. In this article, we present our findings on participant conceptions of heterosexual marking that are related to gender stereotypes, gender differences, and gender inequality. Much of the heterosexual marking described by our participants reflects and reinforces stereotypes that equate gender conformity and heterosexuality. Our data suggest that heterosexual marking by men/boys and women/girls differs in several ways, including gender conformity, sexual prejudice, extent of marking, and types of marking. Furthermore, some aspects and types of heterosexual marking described by our participants reflect and reinforce gender inequality. As a result, our discussion notes some problematic implications of the heterosexual marking we describe, including rendering gender non-conformity among heterosexuals invisible and unacceptable, supporting discrimination against gender non-conformity, and more directly reinforcing gender inequality.

TI Comparing young people's beliefs and perceptions of gender equality
   across 28 different countries
SO GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ASPIRATIONS AND ATTAINMENT: A LIFE COURSE
   PERSPECTIVE
AB This chapter explores young people's perceptions of and beliefs in gender equality across 28 countries and the relationship between these two phenomena. The findings show that while the levels of young people's beliefs in gender equality follow patterns of economic development (GDP) and are associated with actual measures of gender equality (Gender Empowerment Measure), nevertheless, young peoples' perceptions of gender inequalities are found to be independent of beliefs in gender equality, actual levels of gender equality, and economic development. Sweden is found to be the only country where more than 50% of young people combine beliefs in equality with perceptions of inequality. In our analysis, we also find that the willingness to engage in political action is stronger among those young people who believe in gender equality and at the same time perceive reality not to be in accordance with this ideal. These findings suggest that political action is premised on the combination of not only believing in gender equality but also perceiving gender inequality.

TI Gender Equality and Maternal Burnout: A 40-Country Study
SO JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB In Western countries, recent decades have witnessed a revolution toward gender equality. Inequalities have been greatly reduced in areas such as education or employment. Because inequalities lead to distress, this development has largely benefited women. One notable exception is the realm of parenting, which has remained rife with inequalities even in the most egalitarian countries. We hypothesized that experiencing inequality in parenting when one holds egalitarian values and raising a child in a country characterized by a high level of gender equality in other areas, increases mothers' psychological distress in the specific area of parenting. Multilevel modeling analyses computed among 11,538 mothers from 40 countries confirmed this prediction: high egalitarian values at the individual level and high gender equality at the societal level are associated with higher burnout levels in mothers. The associations hold beyond differences in sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level and beyond economic disparities at the societal level. These findings show the importance of egalitarian values and gender equality and their paradoxical effect when inequalities are still present in specific areas as parenting. This study reveals the crucial need to act not only at the micro level but also at the macro level to promote gender equality in parenting and prevent parental burnout.

TI A brief insight into gender inequalities in the Czech labour market
SO DEMOGRAFIE
AB This article looks at women in the Czech labour market. Labour market participation is considered a fundamental factor influencing childbearing decisions and one that may contribute to low fertility. Since 1989 the Czech economy has undergone profound changes. Therefore, the article examines how the position of women in paid work has changed. It studies gender inequality in the labour market in the Czech Republic in 1993-2013 based on publicly available data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). It also uses data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for the Czech Republic in 2012 and employs a multinomial logistic regression to illustrate the factors that influence gender inequalities, which in the article are approximated by type of employment contract. The basic results show that there are persistent gender inequalities in the Czech Republic and that, depending on age, education, and having at least one dependent child, women are less likely than men to have a full-time job.

TI Basic Income Grants or the Welfare State: Which Better Promotes Gender
   Equality?
SO BASIC INCOME STUDIES
AB The implications for gender equality of three regimes are compared: a low tax-low benefit regime, a regime of Basic Income Grants (BIG), and a welfare state offering a generous menu of in-kind and cash benefits concentrated on people with special needs, but not including lengthy paid parental leave. It is argued that the special needs of women, particularly lone mothers, make the welfare state regime superior in promoting gender equality to a regime with BIG benefits, which spreads its cash benefits equally to all citizens. Further, the reductions in labor force commitment that BIG fosters (and which lengthy paid parental leave also fosters) would reverse the progress women have made in the labor market. That progress is the main basis for women's improved status, and undermining it may even make a BIG regime inferior to the low benefits regime in its effect on gender equality.

AB Sustainable transport is one of the key challenges of the UN and EU to ensure to meet society's economic, social and environmental needs whilst minimising undesirable impacts. Sustainability planning may require changing the way we solve transportation problems. From the perspectives of the sustainability, we may assume that the emphasis should move in direction to changing the practice: but exactly what practice and who's practices are to be changed? One way is to investigate gendered mobilities. The main differences in mobility patterns between women and men at a general level, are found in modal choice and travel distance. Women's practices tend to be related to the most sustainable means of transport, while men's practices are related to more unsustainable transport. Relying on studies on transport planning including focus groups, interviews and workshops in Sweden, this paper ties the concepts of gender equality, to contemporary planning and sustainable "smart" mobility, and investigates in what way knowledge about gender equality is elaborated in regional planning practice. It appeared from the interviews that both gender equality and diversity were perceived as difficult in regional transport planning and that more knowledge and experience were needed. It was pointed out that there existed some knowledge but that there were no structures for how it could be incorporated into the planning process. Noticeable are conflicting practices, while policy on gender equality are attached to the planning there are still beliefs that transport planning can be gender neutral and free from social impacts. The smart mobility approach promises improvements of mobility and access opportunities for all.

TI Indicators of Gender Equality for American states and regions: An update
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper describes the methods and data sources used to update state-level indicators of economic, political, and legal gender equality originally developed by Sugarman and Straus (1987). Indicators were combined to create an updated version of the Gender Equality Index and relevant subscales. Preliminary evidence of the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the updated measure is presented. A comparison of state rankings for the original and updated versions of the Gender Equality Index reveal that there continue to be statistically significant differences between U.S. states and regions in the degree of gender equality observed but there is evidence of a trend toward greater homogeneity among states. Scores on the overall index have not increased substantially in states identified as having a high degree of gender equality previously. Instead, the most dramatic increases are occurring in states characterized by lower levels of gender equality previously. Despite increases observed among states, the median score of 62 on the Updated Gender Equality Index reveals that in the typical American state, women have achieved less than two-thirds of what is needed to have equality with men.

TI Low schooling for girls, slower growth for all? Cross-country evidence
   on the effect of gender inequality in education on economic development
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Using cross-country and panel regressions, this article investigates how gender inequality in education affects long-term economic growth. Such inequality is found to have an effect on economic growth that is robust to changes in specifications and controls for potential endogeneities. The results suggest that gender inequality in education directly affects economic growth by lowering the average level of human capital. In addition, growth is indirectly affected through the impact of gender inequality on investment and population growth. Some 0.4-0.9 percentage points of differences in annual per capita growth rates between East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East can be accounted for by differences in gender gaps in education between these regions.

TI GENDER EQUALITY IN EDUCATION: WOMEN'S LIFE-LONG LEARNING ELIMINATING
   GENDER INEQUALITY?

SE ICERI Proceedings
CT 12th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and

CL Seville, SPAIN
AB This study aims at exploring gender equality in education as education is one of the areas where women have experienced discrimination making them a minority group that throughout times has suffered from gender inequality. By now, however, much has been made by international organizations, governments, women's associations, and NGOs to decrease the gender gap in education. Nevertheless, studies show that gender inequality persists which implies that further measures need to be taken. Life-long learning has been seen as one solution to achieve gender equality. As the aim of life-long leaning is to guarantee learning opportunities throughout life for all, it has been assumed that life-long learning would promote gender equality while increasing women ' s participation in learning activities during all life-periods. Importantly, though, research shows mixed results. Some find that life-long learning empowers women as it provides increased learning opportunities, whereas others argue that lifelong-learning has not enhanced gender equality in education. To add knowledge and participate in the discussion, this study explores on the basis of the literature in the field whether life-long learning has achieved its objective of providing equal learning opportunities for all throughout life implying improved gender equality. Accordingly, the research questions are as follows (1) why does gender equality matter in education? (2) how does life-long learning enhance women's learning? (3) what kind of challenges women meet within the framework of lifelong leaning? (4) what can be done to achieve gender equality in education? The research method is qualitative. The research material includes extant research in the field of education and life-long learning, multiple policy documents, and other literature dealing with women's education and learning. The results show that particularly less developed countries still struggle with wide range of challenges in most areas and levels of education, and that girls and women in such countries still face crucial problems in the area of education, whereas the problems related to gender equality in high-income countries are more specific and very different from those of low-income countries. Given this, there is no general theoretical framework nor common practical tools to eliminate gender inequality in education. This study suggests that innovative learning models and methods, increased benchmarking and sharing of best practices as well as policy instruments and international conventions advocating for equality and life-long leaning are required when aiming at eliminating the persistent discrimination of women in education.

   of the new consensus on equality
SO AYER
AB The 1978 Constitution marked an important turning point in Spanish women's citizenship identity, by recognizing the basic principle of gender equality, in contrast to the gender differentiation model of the Franco regime. This article seeks to shed light on the limits of the Constitution's gender equality paradigm through a close analysis of the unfolding Constitutional debates of the late 1970s. It argues that the gender equality paradigm accepted by most major players formed a key element of the famous consensus, but only because it operated on the most abstract symbolic level where it forestalled any serious discussion of female equality.

AB Much has been written on gender inequality and how it affects fertility and mortality outcomes as well as economic outcomes. What is not well understood is the role of gender inequality, embedded in the behavior of the family, the market, and society, in mediating the impact of demographic processes on economic outcomes. This article reviews the empirical evidence on the possible economic impacts of gender inequalities that work by exacerbating demographic stresses associated with different demographic scenarios and reducing the prospects of gains when demographic conditions improve. It defines four demographic scenarios and discusses which public policies are more effective in each scenario in reducing the constraints that gender inequality imposes on poverty reduction.

TI Why achieving gender equality is of fundamental importance to improve
   the health and well-being of future generations: a DOHaD perspective
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB Despite progress in gender equality, women continue to be disadvantaged compared with men. Worldwide, women are more often confronted with poverty, violence, and mental health problems, and they have less access to food and education. All these factors do not only affect women themselves, but also have a negative impact on the child's early environment and impair its early development, thereby reducing the health and well-being of future generations. Framing gender equality as a women's issue fails to highlight the importance of gender equality for the health and well-being of the next generation. As a scientific community investigating early human development and health, we have failed to fully recognize and underscore the importance of gender equality in achieving the best possible start for every child. If women and men had equal rights and opportunities, their children would be more likely to reach their full potential which would improve the health and well-being of future generations. Our studies and interventions have not fully taken into account the complexity of gender inequality and women's disadvantaged positions in society. We need better insight into the complex adaptive interactions between various societal and human factors contributing to gender inequality and find approaches that take this complexity into account. If we want DOHaD science to have societal impact, we should strive beyond gender equality for gender equity and help women achieve equal rights and opportunities. We need to work with public health professionals, human rights activists, and policymakers to gauge the importance of gender equality. After all, gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but also a necessary foundation for healthier future generations.

TI Conceptual foundations of a gender equality index
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
AB Gender equality indexes (GEIs) have become a popular tool for the quantification of unequal resource distribution between males and females. Creating such an index implies an understanding of what gender inequality is, though this question has remained the province of theoretical feminism with little explicit treatment in the methodologically focussed literature. This paper presents an empirically minded, theoretical account of gender inequality, which can be used broadly to inform the development of GEIs. The account proceeds in three steps. First, we argue for a broad understanding of the types of resources that structure gender inequality. Drawing on the work of Bourdieu, we highlight the importance of including symbolic capitals (and indeed viewing gender itself as a symbolic capital). By considering gender as a symbolic capital, we are drawn to the ways that normative maleness hides some types of gender inequality. Thus, caregiving norms and leisure time inequality are brought to the foreground. Finally, in recognizing that there is no single unifying female experience, we describe the ways that gender inequality intersect with other forms of disadvantage, motivating the incorporation of (particularly) race into the index. The result is a comprehensive-and theoretically defensible-set of indicators for the measurement of gender inequality.

TI Gender equality predicts leisure-time physical activity: Benefits for
   both sexes across 34 countries
SO COGENT PSYCHOLOGY
AB Although countries' gender equality is associated with important health outcomes, especially for females, it remains unclear whether gender equality is associated with leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). Data from 34 countries was acquired from the International Social Survey Program, the Pew Research Forum, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Separate analyses were conducted for 21,502 males and 26,652 females. Hierarchal nonlinear Bernoulli modeling was used to examine the association between gender equality and participation in LTPA. Both males and females residing in countries' with higher gender equality were more likely (twice and three times more likely, respectively) to report weekly LTPA than those residing in countries characterized by low gender equality. These effects persisted even when controlling for individual (i.e. age, education) and country-level (i.e. population, gross domestic product) covariates. However, significant variation in LTPA persisted at the country level, suggesting the need for further research. These findings provide novel evidence that both males and females benefit from gender equality. To explain these findings, we hypothesize that increased gender equality decreases the average number of offspring and, in turn, allows mothers more time for leisure, and to invest more resources in both male and female offspring, which may increase LTPA.

   policy?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER
AB This article analyses Eurobarometer surveys as fully fledged instruments of the European gender equality policy since its emergence in the 1970s up until 2018. These surveys bring new data that allow for reanalysing the history of the gender equality policy, focusing on how public opinion is of interest to policymakers and how they use the results of these polls. The article shows that Eurobarometer surveys and the appeal to the 'voice of the citizens' have always had a legitimising function for gender equality, but that the purposes of this legitimisation have changed over time. Recently, in a context of low citizen support for the European Union political system, surveys have been integrated into the day-to-day routine of gender equality policymaking; however, they are also used by the European Parliament to reassert the shared values of the European Union.

SO INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS
AB This article overviews gender equality policies in Spain, and their relation with social policies, from their origins, through their development and dismantlement in the economic crisis context. Gender equality policies have greatly developed in Spain from the beginnings of democracy. They have been institutionalized thanks to the creation of gender equality machinery at all governmental levels; they have diversified their instruments including plans, laws and gender units; and their progress from 2004 to 2008 indicated certain consolidation. However, the backlash provoked by austerity policies adopted in response to the economic crisis since 2008 have shown a lack of prioritization of equality policies when there are conflicting economic priorities. In this context, despite civil society's mobilizations, the future of gender equality policies in Spain looks extremely uncertain.

TI Equality, Protection or Discrimination: Gender Equality Policies in
   Turkey
SO SOCIAL POLITICS
AB European Union (EU) gender Directives are filtered through distinctive national social policy regimes, and differences in political and cultural attitudes toward gender and womens place in society influence the interpretation and implementation of such Directives. This article discusses the impact of the EUs gender equality agenda on the traditional gender roles in Turkey and considers how Turkeys relations with the EU affect the way in which gender policy is drawn up in Turkey. Until now, the Turkish welfare state has rested on the ideal of womens main role in society as mothers and wives. This has manifested itself in the low female participation in the labor force and other structural inequalities between women and men within Turkish society. This article further argues that gender equality polices, in themselves, are insufficient to bring about a change in traditional gender roles and, in some cases, may even work against women. Such policies are destined to occupy the status of legal texts or reach only a small fraction of women, unless supported by policy measures to transform the existing patriarchal norms and roles within Turkish society.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
CT 90th Annual Meeting of the American-Sociological-Association
CY AUG 17-23, 1995
CL WASHINGTON, D.C.
SP Amer Sociol Assoc
AB This article joins the debate over the effect of market-driven economic development on women's work opportunities and household gender inequalities. It assesses women's opportunities for off-farm employment, the relative contributions of female off-farm workers to household income, and the distribution of power in families whose male members have left for off-farm jobs, leaving women behind in agricultural work. We find that women are not uniformly excluded from opportunities for off-farm employment and that economic development does not uniformly increase gender inequalities within Chinese households. Although men are more likely than women to obtain off-farm employment in China, women's opportunities for off-farm work improve significantly when the coexistence of local and regional marketization creates a shortage of male workers and compels employers to hire women. The relative size of contributions to household income for male and female nonfarm workers also narrows incrementally with increased marketization. In addition, women who are left in agricultural work are more likely to become heads of household, a position which brings greater household decision-making power to female family members.

TI Seeing the system: Systemic gender knowledge to support transformational
   change towards gender equality in science
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Scholars agree that gender inequality is systemic and that participants in gender equality interventions need knowledge on gender inequality processes. However, a detailed view on the specific characteristics of this knowledge is as yet missing. This article aims to contribute to gender equality interventions by conceptualizing and visualizing systemic gender knowledge as an important condition for transformational change. Combining gender and participatory system dynamics literature, this article first introduces the concept of systemic gender knowledge. This concept captures two main characteristics that make gender knowledge systemic: knowledge on the interaction of gender inequality processes and endogenous thinking, here implying a focus on the organization as the relevant level of analysis. In addition to this conceptual contribution, the research contributes methodologically to the gender inequality intervention literature by designing a visualization process, translating written texts into system dynamics models which enable exploration of systemic gender knowledge. Finally, the research contributes empirically by exploring the systemic gender knowledge of participants in two science research institutes of a Dutch university, finding shifts in both characteristics of systemic gender knowledge. This enables researchers to discern whether gender equality interventions lead to increases in systemic gender knowledge, thus supporting transformational change.

TI Men and women differ in their perception of gender bias in research
   institutions
SO PLOS ONE
AB There is extensive evidence of gender inequality in research leading to insufficient representation of women in leadership positions. Numbers revealing a gender gap in research are periodically reported by national and international institutions but data on perceptions of gender equality within the research community are scarce. In the present study, a questionnaire based on the British Athena Survey of Science, Engineering and Technology (ASSET 2016) was distributed among researchers working in Spain. Consistent with the original UK-based study, women in research perceived a greater degree of gender inequality than men. This difference was consistent from junior to senior positions, within public and private universities as well as research centres, and across all research disciplines. When responses were compared with the existing UK-based questionnaire, researchers in Spain felt that women and men are treated more equally in the workplace, yet they perceived their home departments to be less supportive regarding matters of gender equality. The results of this study provide clear evidence that men and women do not share the same perceptions of gender equality in science and that their differing perceptions are relatively consistent across two major European countries. The fact that men occupy the majority of senior positions while not perceiving the same inequality as women do, may be critical when it comes to ensuring the fair ascent of women to senior positions in an academic system. These data encourage the implementation of measures to ensure that both men and women are aware of gender biases in research.

TI Height development of men and women from China, South Korea, and Taiwan
   during the rapid economic transformation period of the 1960s-1980s
SO ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY
AB We study height trends among Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese groups during the rapid economic growth period of the 1960s to the 1980s. Heights rose strongly as income grew. Did rapid income growth also cause a decline in gender inequality? Or did it rise because the gains were unevenly distributed? Gender inequality is particularly interesting given the traditionally strong son preference in the region. For mainland China, we find that gender inequality was relatively modest in the pre-reform period (before the 1980s). Especially in comparison to the early 20th century, female heights grew faster than male heights. In contrast, the 1980s transition period to an economic system with market elements was characterized by increasing gender inequality in China. This was the case to an even greater extent in South Korea, where gender dimorphism noticeably increased during the 1980s, paralleling a similar increase in sex-selective abortions. Moreover, we also study other inequality patterns in the three countries, focusing on socioeconomic, regional, and educational differences between groups. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Societal gender inequality and the gender gap in safety perceptions:
   Comparative evidence from the International Crime Victims Survey
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB This study considers whether societal gender inequality moderates the relationship between gender and perceptions of personal safety. Pooled 1992-2005 rounds of the International Crime Victims Survey, comprising more than 285,000 respondents from 75 countries, are used to estimate multilevel models of safety perceptions, with a cross-level interaction specified between gender and gender inequality. We find that the gender gap in safety perceptions, although statistically significant in all countries, is largest in countries exhibiting high gender equality and smallest in countries with high gender inequality. This is explained entirely by variation in men's safety perceptions; male respondents perceive themselves as safer in a milieu of gender equality, but less safe in a milieu of gender inequality. In contrast, the safety perceptions of female respondents are uncorrelated with societal gender inequality.

TI Gender Equality for a Thriving, Sustainable Arctic
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB On 21 May 2021, a milestone Pan-Arctic Report: Gender Equality in the Arctic was published in tandem with the Arctic Council's Ministerial Meeting held in Reykjavik, 19-20 May 2021. This article provides a brief review of the report and its major findings across six chapters that address key themes concerning gender equality in the Arctic: Law and Governance, Security, Gender and Environment, Migration and Mobility, Indigeneity, Gender, Violence, Reconciliation and Empowerment and Fate Control. A major conclusion of the report is that accessible, comparable, gender-disaggregated, and Arctic -specific data is severely lacking. Further, all chapters highlight the importance of gender-based analysis and gender mainstreaming in all decision-making processes at national and regional levels. The varying roles that gender-and its intersections with existing inequalities-plays in mediating the impacts of climate change and other socioeconomic transformations are also discussed throughout the report. The Arctic Council is identified as the main driver for implementing recommendations that were provided and discussed at the Council's Ministerial Meeting and in the Reykjavik Declaration 2021, where the eight ministers of Arctic states "Emphasize[s] the importance of gender equality and respect for diversity for sustainable development in the Arctic horizontal ellipsis encourage[s] the mainstreaming of gender-based analysis in the work of the Arctic Council and call[s] for further action to advance gender equality in the Arctic ". This report and its policy relevant highlights, address these priorities and serve as a knowledge base for promoting gender equality and non-discrimination in the Arctic.

TI Constructing Humanitarian Selves and Refugee Others: GENDER EQUALITY AND
   THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF REFUGEES
SO INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB Contributing to ongoing debates about what happens when feminism is institutionalized in global governance, this article examines how gender equality is given meaning and applied in humanitarian aid to refugees, and what the implications are with regard to the production of subjectivities and their positioning in relations of power. Drawing on Foucauldian and postcolonial feminist perspectives, the analysis identifies two main representations of what it means to promote gender equality in refugee situations. Gender equality is represented as a means to aid effectiveness through the strategic mobilization of refugee women's participation, and as a project of development, involving the transformation of traditional or backward refugee cultures into modern societies. The subject positions that are produced categorically cast refugees as either passive or problematic subjects who need to be rescued, protected, assisted, activated, controlled and reformed through humanitarian interventions, while humanitarian workers are positioned as rational administrators and progressive agents of social transformation. In effect, gender equality is used to sustain power asymmetries in refugee situations and to reproduce global hierarchies.

TI Exploring Sustainability in Parliamentary Gender Equality Work. Insights

SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB Recent research has pointed to the need for addressing gender equality in parliaments in a broader perspective, focusing on "gender sensitivity" in parliaments in relation to structures, operations, methods and work. Up to now, however, the question of what it takes for this work to be long-lasting and sustainable has received limited attention. This article seeks to address this gap through a case study assessing the sustainability of the internal work of the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) with regard to gender equality, focusing on the durability and renewal of early initiatives and reforms. On the basis of Riksdag documents and interviews with MPs during the period 1994-2022, we ask: How sustainable is the internal gender equality work of the Riksdag with respect to the three key areas of representation, infrastructure and culture? We find that the Riksdag has managed to conduct sustainable gender equality work over the course of three decades. Major factors in this success are the institutionalization of a Gender Equality Group, the adoption of Action Plans for Gender Equality every parliamentary term and the legitimacy provided by the support of the Speaker of the Riksdag and the Riksdag Board.

TI Localizing Gender Equality after Conflict
SO PEACE REVIEW-A JOURNAL OF SOCIAL JUSTICE
AB Debates have grown in recent years concerning the realistic utility and application of international human rights law to a local context. Since 2000, the United Nations Security Council has issued eight Women, Peace, and Security resolutions geared toward promoting gender equality measures in conflict prevention during conflict and post-conflict settings. The first of these resolutions, United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, has been adopted by a number of UN Member States through National Action Plans (NAPs), which provide a framework and roadmap for integrating gender equality measures at the domestic level. Although NAPs were once considered promising, they have largely been unsuccessful.
   By examining the implementation challenges facing other gender equality measures and localization programs that seek more effective implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security Resolutions, the following argues that a bottom-up approach rather than a top-down approach must be considered more seriously by international actors supporting implementation and integration of international human rights law, not only for the obvious reason that it emboldens local agency in the adoption process, but also because it is likely to produce outcomes that are meaningful and sustainable for the communities most affected by these provisions.
   As such, continued emphasis on change that emanates from the top down in a given country often ignores the reality that gender equality measures in international human rights law are often perceived by governments and civil society actors as a serious disruption to domestic gender norms. Sole reliance on state institutions to deliver these commitments is flawed because it fails to recognize the necessary dialog and contestation among various stakeholders concerning the role of external norms in a local context.

TI GENDER EQUALITY POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION: PUBLIC POLICY EVOLUTION
   AND THE FEMINIST EVALUATION
SO LJETOPIS SOCIJALNOG RADA
AB Gender regime of the European Union is a distinctive regime characterized by a specific genesis, particular rules and complex procedures. Public policies belonging to the regime represent the gender equality portfolio of member states and candidate countries. It is, therefore, essential to be familiar with their content, as well as their history. The paper analyses the complex creation of the gender equality policy, marked by political conflicts over opposing visions of equality, influence of other international regimes and internal institutional conflicts. The main question is the following: how has gender equality policy developed in the last sixty years, how is it evaluated and what are the projections for its future? In order to address this question, original EU public policy documents are used, as well as insights from rich literature covering the politological aspect of gender and politics. The paper ends with a conclusion that after half a century of development, marked by episodes of public policy innovation (in which the EU was not a mere follower, but rather a leader of progress on the global scene), there is a worrying stagnation in the formulation and implementation of gender equality policy.

TI Situated gender equality in regional research and innovation:
   Collaborative knowledge production
SO SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB Research and innovation (RI) policies in Europe aim to promote gender equality in the field of RI. However, gender equality at the regional level of RI has received little attention and has remained under-researched. This article draws on a process of collaborative knowledge production between regional developers and researchers in Finland, aiming to further gender equality in regional RI (2019-20). It examines negotiations about gender equality that occurred in the course of the process through the notion of situated gender equality. The developers initially stated that gender equality was needed as 'a solution' in regional development but did not know how to implement it. The process of collaborative knowledge production, a dialogue between the practices of regional development and the research-based conceptions of gender and participative methods, shows that gender equality in regional RI needs to be closely integrated into the practices of regional developers' main development work.

AB Gender inequality in research and innovation is well documented (European Commission, 2016) and tools to measure and monitor it have been proposed and tested within EU funded projects as GenderTime (Badaloni & Perini, 2016) or Effective gender equality in research and academia (EGERA) (http://www.egera.eu/). The evaluation proposal at the heart of this contribution has been developed within EQUAL-IST project (Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions) funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme that aims at introducing structural changes in research organizations to enhance gender equality within Information System and Technology Institutions. The dimensions and indicators used to measure gender equality are consistent to those that the literature on gender equality in research and academic institutions have shown to be significant. Our contribution shows an innovation in the choice on how to measure gender equality by using Fuzzy Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (FMCDA). We propose a Fuzzy Expert System, a cognitive model that, by replicating the expert way of learning and thinking, allows to formalize qualitative concepts and to reach a synthetic measure of the institution's gender equality (ranging from 0 to 1 increasing with gender equality achievements) that can be then disentangled in its different dimensions. The latter characteristic of the model that we propose can be fruitfully used by policy makers and Equal opportunity officers in order to detect and address the critical elements in the organization and carry out changes to improve gender equality. A first application of the model has been experimented within the EQUAL-IST project and is available for other universities and research institutions wishing to obtain an assessment of their organization in terms of gender equality. Further developments of the model, together with its wider implementation, include the assessment by using fuzzy logic of gender equality policies and institutional factors affecting gender equality within the institution.

SO SOCIOLOGIA NAUKI I TEHNOLOGIJ-SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The paper discusses the issues of gender inequality in science. It considers the types of indirect information for image formation, as well as artistic means of formation of the image of science in general and the image of a female scientist in particular.
   There is a tradition of painting in the era of socialist realism, reflecting the social representations about a scientist and science in society in the center of authors' interests. The peculiarities of perception and attitudes in society towards female and male scientists and expressive techniques in reflection of scientific activity are studied on the example of a number of paintings by some artists.

TI South South Migration and Discrimination Against Women in Social
   Institutions: A Two-way Relationship
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Using the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) from the OECD Development Centre, this paper provides evidence on the two-way relationship between discrimination against women in social institutions and South South migration. On the one hand, discriminatory social institutions in both origin and destination countries are an additional determinant of female migration. On the other hand, migration implies changes in discrimination against women according to the level of gender inequalities at destination. Specifically, migration toward countries with low levels of discrimination promotes gender equality in social institutions at home, while migration toward destinations with high levels of discrimination has the reverse effect.

AB This exploratory study investigates the subject of the gender equality and women's empowerment and their engagement in smart development, with a primary focus on ICT and wearable technologies, such as small-scale intelligent devices and interactive sensor elements. Although a growing body of academic research on the topic is increasing, there is a gap in envisioning how aspects of the wearable technologies can optimally engage with the context of the development field and women's empowerment in developing countries. The main contributions of this study combine both empirical and conceptual design components to support the design and evaluation of a smart development that enhances gender equality and women's empowerment in developing countries. The first step towards this study was to con-duct a pilot study that involved five newly arrived African women in the USA. Participants were asked to discuss their experience with the role that current digital technology plays in women's empowerment and gender equality.

It is still not visible that there is gender equality in this business. However, there is no gender equality in the salt aquaculture business in Pati Regency in this research hypothesis. Thus, the question arises whether all salt aquaculture always make with their family or are carried out by the salt aquaculture themselves? This paper aimed to analyze the role of gender equality in decision making in households, both in domestic and public activities. This study conducted in 2012 with data updating in 2018 analyzed in 2020-the data took using questions guideline at Pati Regency. This research's primary funding was the investment decision made together in this district's family together. Training or socialization was still only given to the head of the family.

AB Drawing on theories of responsive and reflexive legislation and gender mainstreaming, this article examines the implementation of the gender equality duty and the Single Status Agreement in five English local authorities between 2008 and 2010. Both of these initiatives coincided with the global financial crisis. The data highlights how organizational restructuring following budget cuts resulted in the separation of these two important initiatives between equality and human resource management teams, preventing the duty from reaching the high expectations of the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Women and Work Commission. The reliance on equal pay legislation and the failure to use the gender equality duty missed an opportunity to move away from adversarial forms of legislation and towards more responsive forms of regulation of pay equality.

TI Neoliberalism and gender equality policy in Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB After a Coalition electoral victory in 2013, the Australian Office for Women was returned from the periphery to the centre of government. This was contrary to the expectation that women's policy will be given greater salience under governments of the left rather than of the right. To unpack this puzzle, we examine institutional arrangements and policy directions under successive Labor and Coalition governments in Australia, including the abolition of intergovernmental bodies concerned with gender equality. We find that the influence of neoliberalism has resulted in a blurring of patterns of partisan difference over gender equality policy. There are some continuing partisan differences but also a common pattern of increased emphasis on international and regional rather than domestic policy. The notable exception to this pattern is in the area of gender-based violence.

SO AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY
AB South Africa's constitution promulgates equality, including gender equality. In education, this commitment is enshrined in the South African Schools Act of 1996 (SASA). This policy promises all learners opportunities and freedom to realise their full potential, free from gender oppression. This article asks whether the culture of one school, Hope High School, promotes or hinders the principle of gender equality. I argue that the school, like other schools, is shaped by values, norms, behaviours and traditions of the local communities and is central in reproducing local cultures. As a result, instead of opening up to change and implementing the policy of gender equality in full, the school has chosen to continue promoting the local patriarchal culture by adopting a selective implementation of the policy of gender equality.

AB To what extent has the Beijing +10 process led to the improvement of the lives of women? This paper addresses key issues involved in making such an assessment, in particular, the conceptualisation and measurement of gender equality. It starts with a consideration of three different perspectives concerning the conceptualisation of "improvement" as either economic development, human capabilities, or gender equality. This is followed by an analysis of the tensions between three different models of gender equality. The final section is a critical review of the operationalisation of these concepts and the collection of data necessary to assess progress on each of the 12 critical areas of concern of the UN Platform for Action. In particular, what are the best indicators? The paper engages with the development of international standards of gender equality with a focus on their application in the EU region.

   Names: A Reply to Berggren (2023) with New Data
SO SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
AB A phonetic feature called voicing has been shown to reflect the gendering of names. Vishkin et al. leveraged this insight to examine gender differentiation as a function of increasing gender equality, both across historical time and across the 50 United States. In this reply, I address a wide range of criticisms raised by Berggren on these findings. I begin by presenting novel data from 76+ million baby names in France from 1900 to 2021. Findings converge with Berggren's conclusion that the historical trend of voicing of female names is nonlinear and therefore cannot be fully accounted for by the monotonic increase of gender equality. However, I show the state-level analysis is robust to his critiques. I conclude that there are more gendered names in more gender-equal societies at the state level, even though the historical data does not shed light on the historical development of this phenomenon.

TI How much of the female disadvantage in late-life cognition in India can
   be explained by education and gender inequality
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In social environments characterized by high levels of gender inequality, women fare worse than men in human capital accumulation and health. We examine the association of gender inequality with female disadvantage in late-life cognitive function, using newly available data from Wave 1 (2017-2019) of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), representative of the Indian population over the age of 45. We find a substantial female gap in cognition among mid-aged and older adults in India; early life socioeconomic conditions and education explain up to 74 percent of the female disadvantage in cognition, and model predictions suggest that it takes nine years of education on average to overcome this deficit. However, further contextualizing the environment, we find that the level of education at which differences in late-life cognition between women and men become negligible increases with the degree of gender inequality.

TI Is this a man's world? The effect of gender diversity and gender
   equality on firm innovativeness
SO PLOS ONE
AB Gender diversity is known to have a positive effect on innovation in developed countries. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of gender diversity for innovation also apply to the particular context of developing countries, which is characterized by diverse and lower levels of gender equality. We propose that gender diversity positively impacts innovation in the developing countries participating in our study. In addition, we expect that this effect is moderated by country-specific levels of gender equality. In a cross-country study covering 18,547 firms in 15 developing countries, we find that gender diversity among a firm's owners and workforce as well as having a female top manager benefit innovation in developing countries. Yet, contradictory to our expectations, gender equality does not significantly moderate this relationship. As such, our results underline the importance of enabling and fostering gender diversity and have critical implications for firms and policy makers alike.

AB Historically, Bolivia's society and education system have been characterised by marginalisation based on poverty, ethnicity and gender. The central objective of the Morales government is to redress this imbalance and create a society inclusive of all Bolivians so that they can 'live well'. Our article illustrates how, while the international development agenda sees gender equality as an important element for an egalitarian education system, the latest Bolivian education reform gives gender equality diminished importance in favour of the focus on interculturality. Applying an analytical framework that uses social justice theory and a strategic relational approach, this article explores the agency of teachers to effect social change in relation to gender inequalities in Bolivia. Our research approach is embedded within the interdisciplinary field of international development studies and used mostly qualitative techniques to examine teachers' strategies to act towards gender equality.

AB Gender equality is emphasized globally not just by international organizations such as the United Nations but also by the national governments, as reflected in the relevant policy documents nationally and internationally. However, the practice of gender equality that is embedded in contextual constructions, conceptualizations, and interpretations of gender equality varies across societies and communities. These situated constructions of gender equality have implications for women's participation and experiences in the public and the private spheres in their respective societies. This article draws on data collected from women academics in a Muslim society to investigate the impact of given constructions of gender equality on women's experiences and career trajectories, critically debating the interacting factors that shape these constructions and command "willing" submission with complex implications for their professional journeys.

TI A review of evidence on gender equality, women?s empowerment, and food
   systems
SO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Achieving gender equality and women's empowerment in food systems can result in greater food security and better nutrition, and in more just, resilient, and sustainable food systems for all. This paper uses a scoping review to assess the current evidence on pathways between gender equality, women's empowerment, and food systems. The paper uses an adaptation of the food systems framework to organize the evidence and identify where evidence is strong, and where gaps remain. Results show strong evidence on women's differing access to resources, shaped and reinforced by contextual social gender norms, and on links between women's empowerment and maternal education and important outcomes, such as nutrition and dietary diversity. However, evidence is limited on issues such as gender considerations in food systems for women in urban areas and in aquaculture value chains, best practices and effective pathways for engaging men in the process of women's empowerment in food systems, and for addressing issues related to migration, crises, and whether local food systems food systems are more empowering to women. And while there are gender informed evaluation studies that examine the effectiveness of gender-and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs, evidence to indicate the long-term sustainability of such impacts remains limited. The paper recommends keys areas for investment: improving women's leadership and decision-making in food systems, promoting equal and positive gender norms, improving access to resources, and building cross-contextual research evidence on gender and food systems.

TI How does civil conflict influence gender equality? A case study of the
   Egyptian Revolution 2011-2013
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SOCIOLOGIE
AB Analyzing the changes to gender equality in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, this manuscript evaluates whether civil conflict creates new openings for women's empowerment. Recently, the literature has considered civil conflict a potentially powerful, transformative force in women's social and political inclusion. Given Egypt's comparatively low performance in gender equality achievements and policies, the 2011 Revolution creates a critical opportunity to evaluate the transformative power of conflict. The analysis shows that the Egyptian revolution was transformative of legislation on behalf of women's physical security; women saw gains emerge in this area of legislation from processes connected to the revolution. Pre and post-test, qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest that the key mechanism through which such transformation occurred was the strengthening of the local women's movement. This is demonstrated through a critical analysis of the various mechanisms of change highlighted in the growing literature on conflict and gender equality. However, the analysis also reveals that the lack of women's formal representation and the seizure of power by Islamic forces contributed to setbacks that inhibited further-reaching change during the transition.

TI International spillovers of corporate scandal: evidence from the Harvey
   Weinstein event
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB Exploiting a representative survey which overlapped with the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, we firstly discover that the scandal in the United States causally increased the preference for gender equality in Italy. Consistent with prospect theory, we then show that firms in the entertainment industry experienced excess loss in share value compared to their peers in other industries immediately following the revelation of the scandal. Further analyses suggest that this value impact is stronger for firms with a higher percentage of women executives. Our results are thus relevant for institutional investors holding a global portfolio.

TI Imagining Families: Gender, Youth, and Diversity in Chile
SO AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
AB Feminist scholarship highlights the key role the family plays in promoting or hindering gender equality. This article explores how young university students (N = 1,038) imagine their future regarding family arrangements in the Maule region (Chile). Quantitative and qualitative data suggest young people recognize and value diversity in family ideals, with significant gender differences. However, Chilean legislation and public social policy take the traditional family as the blueprint for state action, jeopardizing those projects that depart from the traditional one. Public policy and social work need to acknowledge the multiplicity of family ideals held by the younger generations to promote gender equality.

TI Studying Housework Across Nations
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY THEORY & REVIEW
AB Long motivated by microlevel paradigms, the study of housework has been revitalized by research emphasizing macrolevel influences. Common trends and persistent differences across the developed world underscore the importance of country context. Gender specialization, gender equality, and socioeconomic (in) equality are cultural and structural domains that channel domestic behavior in predictable directions. By demonstrating the country-to-country differences in the causes and consequences of domestic arrangements, this research points to 5 questions that set a course for studies of housework in comparative context.

TI Understanding how gender inequality may affect children's health: An
   empirical study across 161 countries
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB In the framework of the sustainable development goals, this study aims to answer the question of how the higher degree of gender inequality may affect children's health. Study findings confirm statistically significant associations (P-value <0.001) between Gender Inequality Index (GII), and children's health. It reveals that more than 33% of the variation in immunization rate in children under the age of five is explained by the rate of inequality between genders. This rate is relatively higher for the other studied variables. For example, 76% of the variation in the prevalence of anaemia in children is explained by the rate of inequality between genders, and almost 75% and 80% of the crude birth rate and neonatal mortality rate, respectively, are explained by rate of the inequality between genders. We further study the impact of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, as an index of national wealth, on GII. Results indicate that almost 76% of the variation in GII is explained by countries' GDP per capita. This might shed some lights on the importance of gender equality in labour force participation, and narrowing the gap in gross salaries between women and men.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB In this article, we examine whether regional gender inequality affects a household's decision to participate in stock market in China. Based on a nationwide micro data, our empirical results show that households in counties with greater gender inequality are less likely to hold risky assets. The results are robust to a number of variations in our empirical models. The negative effect of gender inequality on household stock market participation is stronger for households located in northern China. Moreover, we provide evidence suggestive of the role of the declined social interaction operating through gender inequality.

TI Students' perceptions of gender mainstreaming implementation in
   university teaching in Greece
SO JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB The purpose of this study was to explore the status of gender mainstreaming implementation in university teaching in Greek higher education institutions by examining the education students receive regarding gender equality. The Sensitive Assessment of Training for Gender Equality index was used to collect data from 1,194 students from nine Greek public universities over four degrees (Teacher Education, Physical Education, Greek Philology, and Science). The students were purposely selected through an online survey. Participants were between 20 and 53 years old, mostly female (79%) and Greek (98.20%). Findings revealed that formal preparation for gender mainstreaming implementation in university teaching is practically nonexistent. While respondents rated positively the need for incorporating a gender perspective into curricula, recognizing its importance in reducing sexism, developing gender competencies and practicing a gender-sensitive pedagogy, their views differed in the emphasis that should be given to gender training. Science students were less demanding than school teaching, physical education and Greek philology students, as well as male than female students. Additionally, the participants rated institutions' and educators' commitment to gender equality as neutral and did not recognize existing gender inequalities. This suggests that gender mainstreaming is poorly considered in Greek higher education at institutional, curricular, and relational level.

TI Race/Ethnicity and Sex Differences in Attitudes Toward Policies for
   Gender Equality in the United States
SO FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB This study examines whether intersecting identities of race/ethnicity and sex are associated with attitudes toward gender equality policies, using online survey data from a representative sample in the United States carried out in August 2020. Participants (N = 2,443) were categorized as White Male, Black Male, Hispanic Male, White Female, Black Female, and Hispanic Female. Findings reveal that women across racial/ethnic groups and minority men, as compared to White men, have more egalitarian views on the importance of gender equality in policy and politics. While there is general support for women in political leadership, the race/ethnicity by sex differences in attitudes related to gender equality in employment are larger. These findings update and extend prior research on sex differences in gender equality attitudes, including highlighting the presence of a sex and race/ethnicity interaction.HIGHLIGHTSAttitudes are drivers of change when it comes to gender equality.In the US, there is majority support for gender equality, albeit with key gaps by race/ethnicity and sex.Women are more likely than men to hold egalitarian views.Men are more attached to traditional family roles for women, regardless of race.All men tend to relatively gain from patriarchal norms around paid and unpaid work.

SO CITIES
AB Governments and urban planners still struggle to create a strategy where women's interests are well served (Fainstein & Servon, 2005). In Colombia, a country recognized by its progress on critical aspects of the feminist agenda, mayors hold significant planning power. Using a sample of 248 Colombian cities, this article combines content and regression analysis to understand the factors linked to gender responsiveness. Results indicate that the civic groups and city's demographics are key elements on serving women's interest. This study provides an analysis that can help planners, public administrators, and decision makers not only understand the variables determining gender responsiveness, but also define strategies to reduce gender inequality. It also helps to corroborate and dismiss different assumptions that planners and local governments/public administrators have followed in terms of advancing gender equality.

TI The ever-declining role of gender equality in the European Employment
   Strategy
SO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS JOURNAL
AB This article analyses the changing position of gender in the European Employment Strategy (EES) since its 2005 relaunch. Overall, we find a picture of mixed progress towards gender equality goals across Member States. There is evidence of the EU soft law approach leading to positive developments as the use of targets in conjunction with Country-Specific Recommendations and Points-to-Watch have had some influence in promoting gender equality policies among Member States. However, the weakened position of gender mainstreaming in European-level initiatives has led to gender being marginalised or ignored in national and EU policy responses to the crisis. The prominence of gender has declined further in the 2010 revision of the EES under the 2020 banner. This introduces new risks as the emphasis on gender equality falls further down the list of priorities in the streamlining of the Lisbon Process.

SO EUROPEAN SECURITY
AB This article is a contribution to critical International Relations scholarship on European Union foreign and security policy and to the debates on "Normative Europe". It focuses on the ways in which the EU engages with their own gender equality policies in external Security Sector Reform (SSR) missions. By analysing visual materials of the European Union Advisory Mission-Ukraine (EUAM Ukraine) and European Union Capacity Building Mission in Sahel Mali (EUCAP Sahel Mali) missions, this article identifies the discrepancies between EU's proclaimed policy goals about gender equality and visual representations of women and men in the missions' newsletter photos. These representations reflect a lacklustre approach and suggest a lack of commitment to practices of gender equality and positive role modelling in SSR's day-to-day activities. This article suggests the EU-SSR missions overhaul their public communication strategies to focus first on "how" to communicate gender equality norms and only then on "what" to communicate. This study shows one concrete opportunity and space where this can be achieved.

   gender equality
SO FEMINIST THEORY
AB The overall aim of this article is to explore the analytical potential and normative value of Helga M. Hernes' concept about woman-friendly welfare states in analysis of Scandinavian countries. The first part discusses the underlying theoretical, political and normative assumptions about gender equality and social justice related to dimensions such as redistribution, recognition and representation. The second part addresses the analytical potential of the concepts for understanding gender equality developments in Scandinavia. The focus is on three themes related to the desirability, feasibility, and theoretical strength of the Scandinavian welfare and gender equality model and the underlying normative, empirical and theoretical premises. The analysis deals with debates about the public-private split in relation to woman-friendly policies, focusing on parental leave, childcare, and age restrictions in marriages involving foreigners. State feminism is explored in relation to women's political participation and representation and women's ability to influence gender equality policies. Furthermore, national variations in views about state feminism are identified. Finally, the article addresses the role of woman-friendly policies in debates about responses of Western welfare states to globalization, ageing and multiculturalism.

TI Gender Equality, Drinking Cultures and Second-Hand Harms from Alcohol in
   the 50 US States
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Gender inequality and cultures of binge drinking may increase the risk of second-hand harms from alcohol. Methods: Using the 2014-2015 National Alcohol Survey and 2015 National Alcohol's Harm to Others Survey (N = 7792), we examine associations of state-level gender equality measures (contraceptive access, abortion rights, women's economic equality) and binge drinking cultures (rates of men's and women's binge drinking) with individual-level indicators of second-hand harms by drinking strangers and partners/spouses. Results: In main effects models, only male binge drinking was associated with greater odds of harms from drinking strangers. There were significant interactions of gender equality with male binge drinking: High male binge drinking rates were more strongly associated with stranger-perpetrated harms in states low on contraceptive access or abortion rights compared to states high on these measures. Conversely, male binge drinking was more strongly associated with spouse/partner-perpetrated second-hand harms in states with more economic equality, compared to states lower on this measure. Conclusions: Detrimental effects of high male binge drinking rates may be modified by gender equality. Targeted interventions may reduce alcohol-related harms experienced by women in states with high rates of male binge drinking. Restrictions in access to contraception and abortion may exacerbate harms due to men's drinking.

TI From Courtesan to Won Buddhist Teacher: The Life of Yi Ch'ongch'un
SO RELIGIONS
AB This study examines the life of Yi Ch'ongch'un ??? (1886-1955), one of the first female disciples of Won Buddhism, a 20th-century Korean religious movement. Her story shows modernity's impact on Korean women's psyche and social roles, and the progressive initiative of male teachers who advanced gender equality in new Korean religious movements. A range of data, including periodicals, letters, and newspaper articles, enable us to understand the changing face of women during the process of modernization in Korea. This paper gives voice to the significant role of Yi Ch'ongch'un, an exceptional financial sponsor in the formative years of Won Buddhism and an advocate for women's rights. By highlighting her contributions, it becomes clear that the progressive males who pushed for gender equality relied on the support of female-ordained devotees to actualize the doctrine's ideal.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN HEALTH CARE
AB PurposeThis study aims to examine the effects of the historical prevalence of infectious diseases on contemporary gender equality. Previous studies reveal the persistence of the effects of historical diseases on innovation, through the channel of culture. Design/methodology/approachDrawing on the parasite stress theory, the authors propose a framework which argues that historical prevalence of infectious disease reduces contemporary gender equality. The study uses ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares in a cross-section with data from 122 countries between 2000 and 2021. FindingsThis study provide support for the underlying hypothesis. Past diseases reduce gender equality both directly and indirectly. The strongest indirect effects occur through innovation output. Gender equality analysis may take these findings into account and incorporate disease pathogens into the design of international social policy. Originality/valueThis study complements the extant literature by assessing the nexus between historical prevalence of infectious diseases and gender equality.

AB The European Parliament (EP) as one of the key institutions of the European Union has gained considerable powers over time and often presents itself as a constant gender equality promoter. Whilst gender equality in the EP tended to be analysed in terms of women's descriptive, substantive and symbolic representation, this article shifts the focus to the concept of power itself in assessing gender equality achievements in and through the EP. Applying Amy Allen's conceptualization of power as power to, power over and power with to a critical reading of recent literature, it explores who can exercise power over what in the EP and the consequences for gender equality. The article challenges the EP as a unified gender equality actor and highlights its highly gendered nature in which power over and power to are intertwined, with power to occurring without power over and power with unfolding through alliances and coalitions.

TI The gender-equal Union? Measuring female (dis)advantage and achievement
   in European Union Member States using a benefit-of-the-doubt framework
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS
AB This paper examines gender (in)equality in the European Union and the EU countries across six core life domains, 'Work & Money', 'Knowledge', 'Power', 'Health', 'Safety, Security & Trust', and 'Life Satisfaction', for the period 2010-2018. The paper advocates a non-parametric (Benefit-of-the-Doubt) frontier estimation approach for estimating gender inequality across these six domains. The results reveal considerable differences across the domains with larger gender inequalities towards women being observed in the domains 'Power' and 'Work & Money'. However, overall, gender gaps seem to have decreased over the years. By 2018, results indicate a situation of (near) gender equality in four of the six domains in the European Union. At the level of the Member States, results show a geographical pattern with northern countries being more gender-equal and attaining higher achievement scores across the domains, followed by western and then southern countries.

TI GENDER AS A NEW EUROPEAN MODEL OF SOCIOCULTURAL REALITY
SO AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
AB The purpose of the academic paper lies in developing a transnational gender legal model for gender equality in the sociocultural environment of the EU, as well as predicting the consequences of gender equality policy in the EU for social-economic, educational and demographic space through the cultural traditions and values of European nations. It has been established that a wide range of recent investigations' results documenting changes indicate that the gender approach in politics, economics and the social sphere in the context of the cultural paradigm is becoming more and more productive. It has been determined that the gender-legal model for establishing gender equality, developed by the authors and based on cultural knowledge, ensures the development of gender-sensitive strategies in the EU society various life activities.

TI Parental leave policies and time use for mothers and fathers: a case
   study of Spain and Sweden
SO SOCIETY HEALTH & VULNERABILITY
AB States play an important role in gender equality through policy structuring. In this case study, the aim is to explore whether changes in parental leave policies over two decades trickle down to changes in gendered time use in two polarised countries: Sweden and Spain, represented by the Basque Country. Sweden represents dual-earner countries with high relative gender equality, whereas Spain represents a south European policy model supporting a breadwinning/homemaker ideal. The results show that changes in the gendered time use among mothers and fathers in both countries are associated with changes in parental leave policies. Changes in policies directed towards increasing gender equality reduce the gender gap in time use among mothers and fathers and seem to increase gender equality within a country. From these results, the conclusion is that parental leave policies that are structured to promote or enable gender equality could reduce the gender time gap in work among mothers and fathers.

TI Women in educational leadership: The case of Hope High School in the
   Eastern Cape Province, South Africa
SO EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP
AB The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 confers equality on all South African citizens regardless of race and gender. It has been reported that, under apartheid, gender inequality was a way of life and even social liberation movements observed it. Education is not exempt from gender inequality; the Department of Education in 2003 produced the Gender Equality In Education policy. The then Minister of Education committed to the policy and adopted the mainstreaming of gender and the training of education administrators in the implementation of gender equity programmes. Despite these efforts, male dominance continues in areas such as educational leadership. This paper employs a case study approach to investigate the role of institutional culture in undermining the constitutional aim of attaining gender equality. Using feminist critical policy analysis theory to study the mentoring and management style employed in a South African rural high school, the article concludes that despite the policy imperatives, the conservative and patriarchal tendencies within educational leadership undermine the attainment of gender equality. To attain success, implementation of gender policies needs to be strictly monitored.

TI Gender Equality in International Aid: What has Norwegian Gender Politics
   Got to Do With It?
SO GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB Norway is often seen as a "world champion" in gender equality. Norwegian aid policies on gender often emphasize how lessons can be learned from "the Norwegian model" and experiences. This article explores the extent to which Norway's domestic gender policies have influenced the country's aid policies. The analysis, which is based on literature review of Norwegian gender equality history and discursive analysis of the current gender and aid policy documents, reveals that the essence of Norwegian domestic gender equality politics-social policies that address the relationship between care and breadwinning-is largely missing in Norway's aid policies. While we doubt whether a specific model can be exported, we suggest that Norwegian experiences may provide valuable inputs for development aid policies. Since Norwegian aid policies tend to reflect the dominating international aid discourse, our analysis has relevance beyond the particular Norwegian case. We argue that policies of care, motherhood and fatherhood, should be at the heart of the Norwegian and international aid policies.

TI Dating Violence, Protection Orders, and Gender Inequality: A Cross-state
   Analysis of Policy Formulation and Implementation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB Teen dating violence (TDV) is a public health crisis that organizations and individuals in several fields are working to prevent and address. State lawmakers are a group with substantial power to address TDV and intimate partner violence (IPV) through policies including Civil Protection Order (CPO) statutes. Understanding the factors that influence how state legislators craft TDV and IPV policies and how those policies are implemented can lead to policy processes that better serve survivors. Past research suggests the level of gender inequality in a state may be an important influence on TDV policies. This study used a case study approach to compare the processes of adding individuals in dating relationships to CPO statutes in a subset of states (n = 3) with high, middle, and low levels of gender inequality. Results did not suggest that gender inequality was related to variation between states but rather that it was a larger factor that creates the need for TDV policies at all. Relationships between the state IPV coalitions and lawmakers and the historical moment that laws were considered emerged as important factors in interstate variation. Future research can build on these results by further exploring the role of gender inequality in policy processes with additional states or policies and by examining the factors identified here in greater depth. Implications for practice are also discussed.

TI Economic Efficiency or Gender Equality: Conceptualizing an Equitable
   "Social Framing" for Economic Evaluations to Support Gender Equality in
   Disaster Risk- and Environmental-Management Decision-Making
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB It is unlikely that cost-benefit approaches will be effective in identifying investments that support gender equality without a relevant social framing. Criteria for a social framing are lacking, yet cost-benefit approaches often guide investment decisions for disaster risk and environmental management. Mainstream approaches typically do a poor job identifying and characterizing costs and benefits, and often fail to address distributive concerns (i.e., how costs and benefits may be distributed throughout society, to whom, etc.). Gender-blind investments may project responsibility for equality problems onto one sex, potentially augmenting gender inequalities and disaster risk. This article examines evidence from the gender, disaster, and development literature to identify distributive concerns and criteria for an equitable social framing for economic evaluations. Primary distributive concerns identified regard assumptions of women's homogeneity, agency, active participation, and the influence of customary practice and displacement on disaster vulnerability. The need for a gender-responsive social framing that considers the needs of men and women in relation to one another is evident. Second, cost-benefit studies focused on gender equality concerns are reviewed and the social framing is critiqued. Results show most studies are not gender-responsive. Women's health concerns, often exacerbated by disasters, are sidelined by assumptions regarding distributive concerns and reductive outcome measures.

TI Gender equality by design: The case of South Africa's commission on
   gender equality
SO POLITIKON
AB In this article I critically examine the constitutional and institutional engineering involved in promoting gender equality in South Africa through a careful study of the CGE. I trace its political history from its conception in the minds of gender activists at a particular moment in the transitional process, to the promulgation of its existence through the law, to its inception as an institution and its subsequent establishment and design and finally to its practice. My concern is whether 'gender equality by design' and the creation of an institution with a particular constitutional responsibility to promote and monitor gender equality in the state and in civil society, constitutes an appropriate strategy and, potentially, a global model for gender transformation.

TI Equality means business? Governing gender through transnational
   public-private partnerships
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB From the World Bank's 'gender equality is smart economics' to The Economist's 'womenomics' and Nike's 'girl effect', feminism seems to have well and truly penetrated the business world. Government action on behalf of gender equality is well institutionalized but private corporations appear as a new actor in this cause. This article asks: What do businesses and their public partners do in order to advance gender equality? What motivates their engagement now and how does it fit into existing public and private relationships of power? What do they mean for feminist agendas? How legitimate are they? And how effective are they? To address these questions the article examines four exemplary initiatives involving businesses in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment: the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women Global Initiative, the World Economic Forum's Women Leaders and Gender Parity Program, the European Union's Programme on Gender Balance in Decision-Making Positions, and the UN Global Compact-UNIFEM Women's Empowerment Principles for Business. Our purpose is to conceptually locate these initiatives as new private forms of governance involving partnerships with governments. We assess these initiatives employing criteria of feminist evaluation and find decidedly ambiguous results. We argue that the new attention to gender equality in business and global economic governance is both an expression of and a key process in the transformation of states and corporations in the context of global competition and restructuring.

AB We test the hypothesis that women's empowerment correlates with women's international athletic success. Greater gender equality (measured using the Gender Inequality Index) is associated with higher participation and medal counts in the Summer Olympic Games from 1996 through 2012. This relationship persists even after controlling for previously identified nation-level predictors of Olympic success and across alternative measures of success (such as shares of the total, percentage within each country, and medals per athlete). These results provide direct evidence for the long-standing claim that girls' and women's international athletic achievement is linked to women's empowerment.

Accordingly, UN Women Independent Evaluation Office along with Australian and American researchers have written and piloted a new evaluation guide: Inclusive Systemic Evaluation for Gender equality, Environments and Marginalized voices (ISE4GEMs): A new approach for the SDG era (2018). Referred to as the "ISE4GEMs', this guide is an original piece of work that brings together transdisciplinary evaluation methods, re-thinks systemic evaluation methodology and introduces the Gender equality, Environments and Marginalized voices (GEMs) framework. This article provides a summary of the key theoretical concepts that have been synthesized from systems thinking, social and ecological sciences to produce process guidance.

TI Measurement of gender inequality in neighbourhoods of Quebec, Canada
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB Introduction: Few studies have measured gender inequality at levels lower than the country. We sought to develop neighbourhood indicators of gender inequality, and assess their ability to capture variability in gender inequality across Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: Aggregate 2001 census data for 11,564 neighbourhoods were obtained for men and women. Twelve indicators of gender inequality representing demographic/household characteristics, education, income, work/leisure, and political participation were selected. Neighbourhood-level gender inequality scores were computed for each indicator, and examined across parts of Quebec (metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities, rural areas). Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the ability of indicators to capture heterogeneity in gender inequality across neighbourhoods.
   Results: Male-dominant neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to be present for average employment income, labour force participation, employment rate, and employment in managerial positions. Female-dominant gender inequality tended to be present for divorce, single-headed households, and participation in unpaid housework, child and elderly care. Neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to vary across metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities, and rural areas. Gender inequality scores also varied within these geographic areas. For example, there was greater income-related gender inequality in high than low income neighbourhoods. Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the variation in gender inequality across neighbourhoods was greater than expected with chance alone.
   Conclusion: Neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to be present in Quebec, and varied across parts of the province. Greater awareness of and research on neighbourhood-level gender inequality may be warranted to inform gender policies in Quebec and other nations.

TI Breaking the glass ceiling: gender equality practices in a Japanese bank
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB PurposeThis study aims to explore the mechanism of the relationships between financial and non-financial outcomes and gender equality through a case study of a Japanese bank that has consistently pursued gender equality. Design/methodology/approachA single case study was adopted to explore the outcomes of promoting gender equality. Primary data were collected from 12 semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed by rereading and coding the interview responses coded to generate themes. FindingsThrough governance reform in Company A, women have been placed in top management positions and the number of female managers has increased, allowing frontline intentions to be reflected in decision-making. The increased number of female managers has led to a decrease in female turnover, men taking parental leave, improved training of female managers and the recruitment of excellent new graduates. The appropriate allocation of jobs to female managers and employees also meets customer needs and has led to increased sales. Finally, involvement of female employees in product development in male-dominated workplaces brings women's experiences and perspectives to product development, resulting in the development of products that are favoured by customers. Originality/valueThis study determined the mechanism behind the relationships between financial and non-financial outcomes and gender equality, based on agency, upper echelons, resource dependence, institutional and social role theories. It also contributes to gender equality research methodology by providing compelling qualitative stories of gender equality outcomes to increase a company's commitment to promoting gender equality.

TI Wesleyan (Anti)Feminism: A Religious Construction of Gender Equality
SO RELIGIONS
AB Using ethnographic research and interviews, this article explored the construction of gender equality among students and faculty members at the Asbury Theological Seminary. The institution constructed an unusual blend of egalitarianism and anti-feminism using explicitly religious tools. Specifically, it was found that community members constructed firm commitments to gender equality from their heavily individualistic theology and from identification with the New Testament Church. The community's resonance with feminism was also limited by evangelical anti-structuralism and an ethic of Christian humility and moderation. Established constructions of gender equality and inequality in established scholarly, and especially feminist, literature could not fully explain this unusual blend. This paper argues that agency and empowerment can be available to women because of the theological content of their religion.

AB Nowadays, the equality and equal treatment of women and men are general issues that have been addressed in many strategic documents at various levels (international, national and institutional) around the world. EU has a very clear policy in gender equality issues, which is contained in its legislation as a legal guarantee for gender equality. The paper starts with a short overview of EU policy on gender equality issues and main gender equality documents.
   The current state in Bulgaria regarding gender equality is shown on the basis of national legislation documents and gender equality responsible units. The short statistics of gender equality of women and men in Bulgarian higher education (in public and private institutions) are provided as well.
   Authors present a preliminary analysis of the current situation, in the direction of gender equality and more generally against any discrimination, at one typical Bulgarian public university - University of Plovdiv "Paisii Hilendarski", which is the second largest university in the country. The historical, cultural, economic and organizational (structure and governance) background of the University of Plovdiv in relation to the equality is described. A special attention is given to the gender equality issues, mentioned in principal university documents and the existing organizational measures and policies, protecting students and staff from any form of discrimination.
   The paper presents the first steps in the development and implementation of the Gender Equality Plan of the university in the frame of EU Horizon 2020 project - SPEAR "Supporting Plans for gender Equality in Academia and Research". The main goals of the university team, some common positives, risks and obstacles and particular measures in gender equality work of the team are discussed. The university team plan for the project activities is presented, including activities as data collection and analysis, finding stakeholders, Gender Equality Plan development, acceptance and implementation, raising awareness and dissemination, etc.

TI Gender Inequality in Families
SO HANDBOOK OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER, 2ND EDITION
SE Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research
AB Gender inequality permeates society at all levels and in the context of most social institutions. One institution in which gender inequality remains resistant to change is the family. Over time, various theories have examined the causes of gender inequality generally, including biology, sex roles, and "doing gender," each of which has also been applied to gender inequality in the family. Critiques of these approaches include their over-determinism, inability to grapple with gender inequality at macro social levels, and failure to theorize about change. The gender as structure approach looks at gender across multiple levels of social reality simultaneously. This dynamic, multi-faceted theoretical approach can be used to address gender inequality in families to the extent that we are able to take advantage of its complexity. After looking at, and critiquing, various historical approaches to gender inequality, this chapter notes that the gender as structure approach is best suited to examine gender inequality in families today, which are themselves characterized by dynamic fluidity and complexity, and to offer potential avenues for altering that inequality.

AB The aim of the present work is to discuss, from an economic perspective, different forms in which gender inequalities are manifested in the argentine labour market during the period that goes from 1995 to 2003. This period was signalized bay two different macroeconomic models (one of them is the convertibility, and the other, the subsequent to the peso's devaluation). However, this period is characterized by a high and persistent unemployment. In sum, this article will highlight the interrelations between gender and labour market. With this objective, quantitative information coming from the Permanent Household Survey (EPH) and the expanded user base (BUA) will be examined.

TI Measures of Women's Status and Gender Inequality in Asia: Issues and
   Challenges
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB Women in Asia are facing persistent constraints in achieving gender equality and empowerment, despite their progress in recent years. Although quantitative indicators measuring women's status and gender inequality have been used worldwide and produced by various international organizations, they offer somewhat incomplete stories about the nature of socioeconomic disparities. Cross-national comparisons among East and South Asian countries have illustrated some of the similarities and differences among countries in Asia, which also show inconsistent or sometimes contradictory implications. These aspects raise methodological issues regarding the multifaceted and complex nature of women's status and gender inequality. We propose alternative dimensions to make up for the drawbacks in current quantitative indicators. Violence against women illustrates women's status in the private sphere and broader society in general. Further, the fact that women are more vulnerable to natural disasters than men should also be considered in assessing the damage from such events. Thus, given the aims of gender equality, national socio-institutional mechanisms for ensuring it need to be taken into account.

TI Addressing Poverty and Gender Inequality through Access to Formal Credit
   and Enhanced Enterprise Performance in Nigeria: An Empirical
   Investigation
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB Addressing poverty and gender inequality is one of the fundamental targets of the sustainable development goals. Access to finance, however, has been identified as one of the ways to reduce poverty and gender inequality. The main focus of this study, therefore, is to ascertain the impact of access to formal credit on enterprise performance. The study uses Nigerian Enterprise Surveys data for 2010 to construct a direct measure of credit constraint. From propensity score estimations, the results show that access to formal credit matters and has significant impact on enterprise performance indicators. Firms that are credit constrained have significantly lower output per worker, capital per worker, employment of labour and investment in fixed assets for expansion compared to firms that are not credit constrained. This is more pronounced for women-owned enterprises after adjusting for bias in the estimations and controlling for sampling weights. This suggests that one way to support the growth of enterprises in Nigeria is to make access to formal credit less stringent. Also, government and monetary authorities should support credit expansion policies for medium and small enterprises in Nigeria.

TI Slaying the Seven-Headed Dragon: The Quest for Gender Change in Academia
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB In this article we propose a multi-level distinction between gender inequality practices and gender equality practices to come to better understanding of the slow pace of gender change in academia. Gender inequality resembles an unbeatable seven-headed dragon that has a multitude of faces in different social contexts. Based on an empirical study on the recruitment and selection of full professors in three academic fields in The Netherlands we discuss practices that should bring about gender equality and show how these interact with gender inequality practices. We argue that the multitude of gender inequality practices are ineffectively countered by gender equality practices because the latter lack teeth, especially in traditional masculine academic environments.

TI Gender equality in the 21st century: Overcoming barriers to women's
   leadership in global health
SO JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
AB Purpose The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the significant role that women play in providing global health care, barriers encountered to achieving gender equality in global health leadership, and to propose key recommendations for advancing gender equality in global health decision-making through the integration of gender mainstreaming, gender-based analysis, and gender transformative leadership (GTL) approaches. Method Data were evaluated to determine the participation rate of women in global health care and social sector roles in comparison to men. Gender equality data from the United Nations, World Health Organization, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Labour Organization, and other resources were analyzed to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on gender equality with an emphasis on women in global health leadership positions, the health care and social sector, and gender equality measures for girls and women throughout the world. The literature was examined to identify persistent barriers to gender equality in global health leadership positions. Additionally, a review of the literature was conducted to identify key strategies and recommendations for achieving gender equality in global health decision-making; integrating gender mainstreaming; conducting gender-based analysis; and adopting GTL programs, incentives, and policies to advance gender equality in global health organizations. Findings Women represent 70% of the health and social care sector global workforce but only 25% of senior global health leadership roles. Since 2018, there has been a lack of meaningful change in the gender equality policy arenas at global health organizations that has led to significant increases in women serving in global leadership decision-making senior positions. During the pandemic in 2020, there were nearly 100 open vacancies-one-quarter of CEO and board chair positions-at global health organizations, but none were filled by women. Women disproportionately provide caregiving and unpaid care work, and the pandemic has increased this burden with women spending 15 hours a week more on domestic labor than men. A lack of uniform, state-sponsored paid parental leave and support for childcare, eldercare, and caregiving, which is overwhelmingly assumed by women, serve as major barriers to gender parity in global health leadership and the career advancement of women. Conclusion The pandemic has adversely impacted women in global health care and social sector roles. During the pandemic, there has been a widening of the gender pay gap, a lack of gains for women in global health leadership positions, an increase in caregiving responsibilities for women, and more women and girls have been pushed back into extreme poverty than men and boys. Globally, there is still resistance to women serving in senior leadership roles, and social and cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and restrictions on women's rights are deeply intertwined with barriers that reinforce gender inequality in global health leadership. To ensure comprehensive human rights and that equitable workforce opportunities are available, the concept of gender equality must be expanded within the global health community to consistently include not only women and girls and men and boys, but also persons who identify as nonbinary and gender nonconforming.
   Efforts to eliminate remnants of systemic and structural gender discrimination must also incorporate gender mainstreaming, gender-based analysis, and gender transformative approaches to achieve gender equality throughout global health systems and organizations.

TI Just talking? Middle managers negotiating problem ownership in gender
   equality interventions
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB An important condition for gender equality change is that managers become problem owners of gender inequality, being responsible for change and committed to action. Managers regularly resist such problem ownership. This research explored how managers in a participatory gender equality intervention in science negotiated their problem ownership. The findings contribute to gender equality change literature by showing that resistance can be productive of gender equality change when the intervention provides a compelling space for negotiations on problem ownership. In addition, our research unpacked the notion of problem ownership into a complex layering concerning personal and group responsibilities and personal and group actions, providing a more detailed understanding of resistance of managers against change agency.

In such a context, our opinion is that educational systems also have the duty to train students to respect principles such as tolerance, solidarity and respect for others. This paper reflects the gender equality perception of engineer students in their university and at a personal level of understanding. Gender equality in engineering universities has always been a dilemma due to the differences that exist among enrolments per gender at such universities. The present paper uses qualitative methods in order to reflect that gender inequalities are present in such universities.

TI Normative coherence for development and regionalism: Gender equality in
   ASEAN's migration policies
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB MotivationThe United Nations 2030 Agenda recognizes regions as important actors in implementing the sustainable development agenda. At the same time, regions are often criticized for lacking effective implementation, especially in relation to gender equality.
   PurposeThis study examines whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) implements its global commitment to gender equality at a regional level.
   Methods and approachWe apply qualitative analysis of key ASEAN documents in order to determine how gender equality is implemented regionally. We particularly focus on frameworks related to female migrant workers in ASEAN.
   FindingsThe analysis shows that ASEAN is formally committed to improving gender equality at a regional level, however, female migrants often end up in unfavourable conditions and precarious work relationships without any institutionalized protection because ASEAN's gender equality initiatives are largely concentrated in the Cultural Community and absent from the Economic Community, indicating an absence of normative coherence for development with regard to gender equality.
   Policy implicationsThis limited impact of emerging regional commitments to gender equality arises from incoherences in ASEAN's normative governance framework which undermine normative coherence for development at the regional level.

AB The paper describes gender inequality in employment across 28 EU countries. Gender inequality in employment persists despite European commission is focused on decreasing it. Gender equality is guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and supported by the Strategy for equality between women and men and also by the Europe 2020 Employment Strategy. However, women are still in a worse position on the labour market compared with men. Therefore, European Commission (EC) focused mostly on achieving lower disparities between genders by encouraging women to participate on the labour market. EC guarantees the same working rights for both genders with the aim of preventing discrimination. Gender inequality differs depending on the analysed sector. Therefore, the paper focuses on the analysis of the employment gender inequality across sectors since 2000 until 2017. Gender inequality indicator was calculated as a ratio between the lower and upper gender rates minus one to assess the severity of the inequality. Further, we have compared gender inequality indicators in employment and the labour force participation. Positive linear correlation was determined too. Gender inequality indicator for employment was always higher than gender inequality indicator of labour force participation, and it was more susceptible to structural changes. Gender inequality in employment did not depend on time, but it has depended on country and employment sectors. The highest gender inequality value was reported in southern countries such as Malta, Italy and Greece, while the lowest one was reported in northern countries, such as Sweden and Finland. When it comes to sectors, men were employed more than women in agriculture and industry sector, while women were employed more than men in services sector. However, when gender inequality indicators across sectors were compared, higher gender inequality was reported when women were worse off on the labour market. The crisis in the year 2008 had substantial impact on the employment gender inequality and it led to its decrease on panel level. The consequences of this impact were permanent, and it set the new, lower equilibrium of the employment gender inequality.

TI A woman can become a 'man': Rituals and gender equality among the Nsukka
   Igbo of south-eastern Nigeria
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTANGIBLE HERITAGE
AB Scholars of gender inequality tend to neglect ritual as a mechanism that can aid gender equality - even when it is obvious that rituals are cardinal in bridging the equality gap between genders. Basing its argument on the incarnate being institution among the Igbo, an essentially male -dominated institution, this study explains how rituals empower women to attain equal status with men and help them to participate actively in the institution. Questions to address include how women are admitted into the society, nature and meaning-cum-essence of the rituals. Using oral interviews, participant observation, video clips and photographs of women who underwent rituals, this paper argues that ritual is a potent force in the attainment of gender equality. This paper aims to help elucidate the logic of the rituals and bring to the fore how the intangible heritage of an Igbo society helps bridge the gender inequality gap.

TI Analysing Failure, Understanding Success: A Research Strategy for
   Explaining Gender Equality Policy Adoption
SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB One of the major challenges within feminist research is to understand the conditions under which gender equality policies are adopted. This article addresses the issue from a methodological point of view: it suggests that previous research on gender equality policy adoption has mostly focused on "successful" cases, and it presents a research strategy for systematically analysing opposition and "failed" attempts at gender equality policy adoption, that is, reform attempts that have not become laws or regulations. A closer analysis of failure is important for understanding success: we cannot be sure that the factors identified as conducive to gender equality reform are really missing in unsuccessful reform attempts unless we pay explicit attention to such attempts. The research strategy suggests three issues that should be addressed: (1) specify and select "unsuccessful" cases, (2) focus explicitly on resistance to the reform proposal, and (3) conduct a dynamic analysis of the strategies of proponents and opponents. We illustrate the research strategy by making use of a failed attempt at reform in the Swedish labour market: the individualization of the parental leave system.

TI Sex and relationships education and gender equality: recent experiences
   from Andalusia (Spain)
SO SEX EDUCATION-SEXUALITY SOCIETY AND LEARNING
AB Despite recent advances in sex and relationships education (SRE), the Spanish education system still lacks coherent policies in this field. This paper provides an overview of the current situation, focusing specifically on Andalusia, and discusses the importance of providing SRE for young people. It first describes current Spanish education policy on gender equality and shows how this leaves little space for SRE. It then presents data on young people's sexuality and relationships collected in the course of an action research project utilising different qualitative techniques. Data deriving from 27 in-depth interviews focusing on values, norms and practices relating to young people's sexuality and relationships, conducted in two secondary schools in Granada, Andalusia, are then analysed in order to identify the degree of gender equality present within them. The results suggest that in sexual relations young people tend uncritically to accept and reproduce many of the patriarchal dimensions of gender and sexuality. Findings highlight the importance of linking more closely SRE to gender equality education policies in Spain.

TI Challenging and reinforcing gender boundaries at work
SO EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse management and employee experiences of gender divisions at work and to reflect on gender boundaries using the method of democratic dialogue. It also considers the use of experiences in efforts supporting workplace democracy.
   Design/methodology/approach - Finnish action research project sought to promote both gender equality and democratic dialogue. Content analysis is applied on group discussions on promoting gender equality at work.
   Findings - Gender divisions in organizations were widely recognized. Challenges arose from the incompatibility of images of gender and gendered images of work. Participants' perspectives varied depending on their hierarchical position.
   Research limitations/implications - Democratic dialogue provides tools to approach sensitive topics that need special attention in promoting gender equality.
   Practical implications - Work organizations need to use forums that bring together management and employee perspectives with a gender-sensitive approach to support workplace democracy.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that, to enable change, the understandings of gender and gender equality have to be negotiated on the local level and in a way that connects to participants' realities and experiences.

TI "Save the Girls!" Gender Equality and Multiculturalism in Finnish Youth
   Work Contexts
SO GIRLHOOD STUDIES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
AB This article examines multiculturalism and gender equality in the light of ethnicity, gender, and agency so as to illustrate how gender equality is used as a marker of Finnishness in various youth work contexts. The data presented consists of interviews with youth workers (n=42) and ethnographic fieldwork carried out from 2003 to 2005. The results illustrate that questions related to multiculturalism have enhanced the visibility of gender equality in youth work. The identification of gender-based inequality is connected, in particular, to girls from migrant backgrounds whose education and well-being are of social concern. Youth work itself is often seen as gender-neutral and equality-based. However, this illusion of gender equality reflects more the ideals of equality which are not being concretized in the practices of youth work. Equality in this context is defined as a purely quantitative concept: the solution to any possible inequalities is, therefore, that everyone should be treated in the same way.

AB The promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment has been a goal of the United Nations Organization and its specialized agencies, within each one's particular scope of competencies. The World Maritime University (WMU), a postgraduate maritime university founded by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has put in place its own policies to promote the participation of women in the maritime transport sector. The main idea behind this case study analysis is to look at how WMU's policies on gender equality and women's empowerment have evolved over time; their impact on student and employee body, curriculum, conferences and seminars; and propose areas for improvement. This research is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of an ongoing process by exploring enrolment and hiring statistics, documents and related articles over a period of 34 years (from 1983 to 2017).

TI Gender and green jobs in agriculture
SO AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY
AB Greening the agricultural sector is envisioned to generate millions of green and decent jobs, benefitting African countries in particular, thus contributing to poverty reduction, promoting social and economic development, and offering solutions to some urgent environmental challenges. Compelling theoretical arguments presented in the literature make a strong case not only for greening the agriculture sector to create new green jobs and upgrade the existing ones, but also for an opportunity to advance gender equality and women's empowerment, in a sector engulfed by major gender disparities. It is a sector in which women make up the majority of the labour force. This open forum piece examines the possibility of advancing gender equality and women's empowerment in Africa through green jobs creation in agriculture. It draws on available existing literature and case studies from African countries. Among the major findings is that, if the right choices are made, the possibilities of green agriculture to deliver on the envisioned promises are immense. However, the challenges that must be overcome in agriculture appear to be more daunting than the possibilities. One of the recommendations is that the commitment to achieve gender equality should set a foundation for comprehensive, gender-responsive, and human rights-based green agricultural initiatives.

TI ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OF ENSURING GENDER EQUALITY IN UKRAINE
   AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The purpose of the article is to study the economic and legal foundations of ensuring gender equality in Ukraine and the countries of the European Union. In the process of the research, it is established that the strengthening of the processes of globalization and reformatting of the world economic order lead to the need to ensure gender equality in the context of international human rights activities. The problem of equalizing the rights and opportunities of men and women for a long time has been the object of legal regulation, as there are processes of strengthening gender asymmetry, manifested in gender violence, significant gender gaps in the labor market, in terms of wages and pensions, gender segregation, a significant level of gender inequality in the economy and critical in politics, as well as in individual inconsistencies in the legal provision of countries with European norms. It is found that highly developed countries have a better potential to ensure high indicators of gender equality, as evidenced by the high values of the Global Gender Gap Index, while countries with a lower level of development are able to ensure a minimal gender gap in access to education and health care, and in relation to women's participation in economic life and politics, there are significant problems and obstacles. It is found that the current legislation of Ukraine needs improvement in terms of strengthening criminal liability for committing gender-based violence, and at the European level, the need to find and justify effective methods of ensuring gender equality regarding women's access to political life is noted. In order to identify common features of ensuring gender equality in the countries of the European Union and distinguish Ukraine's place among them according to the Global Gender Gap Index, it is proposed to conduct a cluster analysis, the results of which indicate the division of the countries of the European Union into three groups depending on the level of gender equality in them: countries with high level, medium level countries and low-level countries. Indicators of gender equality in Ukraine showed that it belongs to the third group, which indicates the deepening of the problems of gender inequality.

SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB This article uses panel data for 34 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to investigate the effects of gender inequality and governance on poverty. It applied a maximum likelihood estimation of random effect models. We found that high gender inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa contributes to high poverty. The results also show that good governance in Sub-Saharan Africa may have a decisive positive impact on poverty reduction. The results are robust at country- and region-level data. It is also found that the net effect from the interaction of gender inequality and absence of good governance can have a potential impact on increasing poverty. Hence, to get out of poverty, improving human development and refining frameworks that improve institutional quality through voice and accountability, regulations, and government effectiveness on socioeconomic issues are necessary. The high gender inequality in the region should also be decreased.

SO AGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS JOURNAL
AB The African Union and African states' have committed to upholding gender equality and women's rights. A pivotal mechanism for advancing this commitment and human rights in general is the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, with its broad substantive jurisdiction. This article considers the legal basis for gender parity and the extent to which gender representation and women's rights has been advanced through or by the Court. It establishes that though the Court's jurisprudence on women's right is quite scant, the Court has illustrated its potential and willingness to protect women's rights through its advisory and contentious jurisdiction. Significant strides have also been made in attaining gender equality on the Court's bench, but with more to be done in terms of substantive representation in the Court's leadership positions.

TI Militarization and Gender Inequality: Exploring the Impact
SO JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY
AB Feminist scholars have long argued that militarism and patriarchy are linked. To date, however, the relationship between militarization and gender inequality has not been empirically tested. Using the Gender Inequality Index and the Global Militarization Index for the period of 1990-2017 for 133 countries, we put the spotlight on militarization to show how it reflects and contributes to gender inequality (in terms of health, education, political representation, and labor force participation). Our article shows that higher militarization is significantly correlated with higher gender inequality, controlling for major variables such as the military in politics, the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women, conflict, democracy level, and regime type. Among other results, we find that higher representation of women in parliament correlates with less military spending. The results are significant in the case of Muslim majority countries and MENA countries, and with respect to countries with different income levels.

TI Gender equality and equal opportunity mechanisms in italy
SO TEMIDA
AB As a country of Southern European mentality Italy may be taken as the nearest-to-the-Balkans model of the gender equality mechanisms and necessity of their existence. Italy also might be taken as a model of domain and methods of functioning of the gender equality mechanisms as well as their connections with the EU development funds. Besides the Italian Ministry for Rights and Equal opportunities and the National Committee, the attention was paid to the whole range of local mechanisms and legal regulations dealing with advancement of women's employment and counteracting discrimination on the labor market. In the text are analyzed through the five chapters the Italian mechanisms/institutions for gender equality as located within the European institutional environment but also within the context of Italian recent history of struggle against gender based discrimination. It was stressed that the essence of the accumulated European institutional wisdom is in diversity of the gender equality bodies rather then in their uniformity. Although the Italian mechanisms for gender equality are part of the European institutional environment their aim is to meet the internal needs for advancement of gender equality. Besides, the mechanisms also meet the demands of the international standards comprised in the documents issued by the UN and the EU. In European countries these mechanisms are frequently established and function in the domains of the labor and employment regulations, but also are located within the human rights portfolios while somewhere are connected with the minority rights and equal opportunity implementation.

TI Women's Empowerment Without Power: Strategic v. Practical Interests in
   SDGs and the Voluntary National Reviews
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB This study examines country's voluntary national reviews (VNRs) to assess global commitment to gender equality in the era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the SDGs promise realisation of gender equality, progress data indicate that gender equality will not be achieved in the next century, let alone by the SDGs target date of 2030. This study posits two explanations for slow progress on gender equality: (i) countries selectively pursue gender equality, as evidenced by our finding that country VNRs demonstrated commitment to achieving only 31% of extant gender equality gaps;and (ii) countries are more committed to achieving gender equality on 'practical' dimensions (i.e., relating to basic needs, such as maternal health and education) than 'strategic' dimensions which seek to challenge unequal power relations and women's subordinate position within society (e.g., income, land, political power). Whether via refinements to the SDG/VNR process, or through well-established gender platforms such as the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index and Equal Measures 2030 SDG Gender Index, gender equality advocates must push for pursuit of the entirety of the holistic gender equality agenda as hard-fought for and agreed by the seminal Beijing Platform for Action. Without greater attention to strategic dimensions, women will be stuck in a vicious cycle of 'empowerment without power' and gender equality will elude women for yet another century.

TI No Empowerment without Rights, No Rights without Politics:
   Gender-equality, MDGs and the post-2015 Development Agenda
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES
AB The main argument of this paper is that progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment in the development agenda requires a human rights-based approach, and requires support for the women's movement to activate and energize the agenda. Both are missing from Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 3. Empowerment requires agency along multiple dimensions-sexual, reproductive, economic, political, and legal. However, MDG 3 frames women's empowerment as reducing educational disparities. By omitting other rights and not recognizing the multiple interdependent and indivisible human rights of women, the goal of empowerment is distorted and "development silos" are created. Women's organizations are key actors in pushing past such distortions and silos at all levels, and hence crucial to pushing the gender equality agenda forward. However, the politics of agenda setting also influences funding priorities such that financial support for women's organizations and for substantive women's empowerment projects is limited. To re-focus the post-2015 Development Agenda around human rights, we conclude by outlining an approach of issue-based goals and people-focused targets, which makes substantive space for civil society including women's rights organizations.

The question is all the more relevant because gender equality is shaped very differently in the European Union and the African Union policies. The African Union has adopted a rather holistic understanding of gender equality, while the European Union approach is constrained by a market-making logic. Also, since the 2008 economic crisis, gender equality policies within the European Union seem to stagnate while they seem to expand in the African Union. Our analysis of core texts shows that at interregional level attention to gender equality is fragmented. Even though in some respects the African Union gender equality norms are more encompassing, and gendered effects of crises in the European Union would merit renewed attention to gender equality, the European Union norms and interests dominate the agenda. Showing how power asymmetries between and disjointed logics of regional organizations impact interregional gender equality norms, the article contributes to the scarce literature on interregional norm dynamics.

TI Interrogating gender inequality to address gender violence: Using
   literary texts as catalysts in an English Education lecture-room
SO AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY
AB In this briefing I argue for the necessity to confront sexist values articulated by student teachers. I contend that acceptance of gender inequalities enables gender violence, and student teachers are well placed to serve as advocates for gender equality and activists against gender violence in schools. I present findings from a two-year participatory action research (PAR) study that used literary texts as catalysts to interrogate issues of gender inequality and violence. The study was underpinned by critical pedagogy and asserted an empowerment and transformation agenda. Using qualitatively analysed data from observations, interviews, focus-groups and written tasks, I found that when the student teachers, the majority of whom were female, discussed representations of gender inequality in the literary texts, they articulated an acceptance of patriarchy. While they understood that patriarchy and gender violence needed to be denounced, they perpetuated those values. The study thus had to engage them to confront such values. However, as the cycles of the study proceeded, they were able to interrogate issues of gender from an informed position and thus engender their journeys towards empowerment and transformation.

TI Changing male perceptions of gender equality: Evidence from a randomised
   controlled trial study
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB In this study, we use a randomized control trial to examine whether asking Vietnamese men to reflect on gender equality can reduce their gender bias. We randomly selected two groups of married men in four rural provinces and asked the first group to make comments on gender-related laws and the second group to write stories about gender equality. We find that commenting on gender-related laws does not reduce men's bias against women, while writing stories has a strong effect on reducing prejudice against women. Writing stories increases the index of gender attitudes of men in the second group by 0.29 standard deviations. The assignment also has a small effect on their contribution to housework. Changing men's behaviour in practice requires stronger and more sustained interventions.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Different United Nations Organisations
SO FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The author outlines changing approaches to women's issues and gender equality in the UN system both before and since the International Women's Year in 1975 and describes how different UN organisations followed up the recommendations made by the large global women's conferences. Besides the UN itself the focus is on the large specialised agencies: FAO, ILO, UNESCO and WHO, two technical agencies in male-dominated areas - IMO and UNIDO - and two funds specifically related to women and children - UNFPA and UNICEF - during the period up to the end of the 20th century. The recommendations adopted by the women's conferences required a rethinking and a reorganisation of work in the UN organisations, but the follow-up encountered bureaucratic problems and resistance to change as well as to gender equality. Although some progress was made - more in some organisations than in others-implementation of the recommendations was slow, cumbersome and incomplete.

TI Gender Inequality: Entrepreneurship Development in the MENA Region
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Entrepreneurship is increasingly popular among policy makers worldwide to promote and achieve economic development and growth. However, entrepreneurship rates differ from one country to another, and particularly the number of women entrepreneurs is still significantly lower than the number of male entrepreneurs in many contexts. In the present paper, we critically assess how country measures of gender inequality shape men and women's entrepreneurial intentions, which were shown in literature to be excellent predictors of the establishment of new ventures. We analyze the direct and moderating effects of gender inequality on important individual-level antecedents of entrepreneurial intention. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) identified gender inequality as a key contributor to the loss of human development and declared "gender equality" as a sustainable development goal (SDG) in the UN 2030 agenda. Our research draws on the gender inequality index and GEM data from nine Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries. Our results show that a culture of inequality leads to limited entrepreneurial behavior by both men and women in a population.

CT International Seminar on Developing Gender Equality in Adut Education
CY JUN, 2004
CL Univ E Anglia, Norwich, ENGLAND
HO Univ E Anglia
AB This article is about mainstreaming gender equality in adult basic learning and education (ABLE). Gender equality is defined as equal rights of both women and men to influence, participate in and benefit from a programme. It is argued that specific gender analyses of emerging patterns of gender relations is helpful in formulating gender equality objectives and strategies of ABLE programmes. Both female and male roles and motivations are important to understand. The consequences of poverty and unemployment for men, as well as women, need to be addressed in gender sensitive ABLE strategies so that, at the same time as women are empowered, men get a chance to regain a meaningful role in society without regressing to old partiarchal attitudes.

TI The Impact of Personal Security Dispositions on Citizen Support for the
   Pursuit of Gender Equality in US Foreign Policy
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB Since 1995, presidents from both parties have increased US government initiatives in pursuit of global gender equality, but there has been little scholarly work that explores public support for these initiatives. We analyze the level of citizen support for several types of global gender equality programs. In addition, we explore support for one specific rationale for the policy -the argument that the participation of women in decision-making will make the world a more peaceful place. Our central hypothesis is that personal security dispositions are an important correlate of support for global gender initiatives, and our analysis yields support for the hypothesis. Citizens who place a high value on personal security display stronger support for gender equality in foreign policy. We close with suggestions for further research and discuss the policy implications of our findings, in particular with respect to public opinion on the use of military force.

TI Exploring gendered change: concepts and trends in gender equality
   assessments
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB More than a quarter century after the Beijing Platform for Action solidified the importance of gender equality in international development, it is timely to review the conceptual approaches used to assess the gendered impacts of interventions. This paper presents a systematic review of recent investigations of gender equality from development-related academic literature (2009-2019) using two analytical approaches. First, we visualise trends based on bibliographic, methodological, contextual and conceptual aspects (n = 150). Second, we explore the theoretical approaches used to conceptualise gendered change through co-citation analysis (n = 61). Our trend analysis shows a breadth of relevant disciplinary perspectives but limited geographic and content foci. Additionally, very few studies explore gender equality dynamics that involve men and boys. Our exploration of theoretical foundations identifies four conceptualisations of gendered change, each reflecting the divergent disciplines, actors and interests that operate in the gender and development space. These conceptualisations each rely on and expand the concept of empowerment. By critically reflecting on feminist principles, future studies can transcend narrower empowerment framings and contribute more meaningfully to the aim of gender transformative development.

TI European Muslim Youth and Gender (in)Equality Discourse: Towards a More
   Critical Academic Inquiry
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In Europe, gender equality can be framed as a secular value, juxtaposed against affiliation with and practice of Islam. Academic and public debate has either given special attention to the spread of religious fundamentalism in Europe, or to the way Muslim women dress, citing how both purportedly jeopardize gender equality. This is despite findings that a link between gender equality and religiosity or practice of Islam is neither inherent nor circumscribed. Moreover, it is possible to demonstrate that such discourse rests on implicitly racialized conceptualizations of the Muslim "other". Meanwhile, Muslim youth in particular are benchmarked against these imagined standards of gender equality, as compared with non-Muslim peers. This work examines ways in which normative secular frameworks and discourses, taking ownership of gender equality narratives, have shaped Europe's academic inquiry regarding Muslim youth. It notes what is absent in this inquiry, including intersections of race and class, which remain divorced from the limited conversation on gender and religious difference. A reflexive, intersectional approach to this discussion, conscious of the importance of embedded racial or structural inequality and what is absent in current inquiry, better serves in understanding and navigating power relations that ultimately contribute to multiple exclusion of these youth.

TI Wind from the North, don't go forth? Gender equality and the rise of
   populist nationalism in Finland
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB The article considers the future prospects of the struggle for gender equality in light of the growing appeal and electoral success of parties embracing populist nationalism and anti-immigration as their platform. Considering many such parties are known for viewing the promotion of gender equality as unnecessary or even harmful - except when they highlight immigration as a threat to female emancipation - it is important to explore what, if anything, the electoral success of populist-nationalist parties means for the direction of gender equality policies. The article examines this question in the Finnish context. Though the Finnish state's commitment to gender equality is well-established, questions can be asked about the future prospects of gender equality policies in light of the electoral rise of the populist anti-immigration party Perussuomalaiset (or 'True Finns'), especially since the party joined government in May 2015. The article scrutinises the recent record of PS in parliament and government, elucidating on the challenges that populist-nationalist parties create for gender equality in (allegedly) 'women-friendly' welfare states. The case study particularly focuses on gender equality in the context of balancing work and family and freedom from violence, discrimination and harassment. It raises questions that are of broader relevance to the future of gender equality in Europe, considering the Nordic states have been viewed as models for a gender egalitarian society and frontrunners in the promotion of gender equality within the EU.

AB Switzerland is characterised by a relatively laggard and gendered leave scheme. This study asks: What were the developments of parental and paternity leave policy proposals in the Swiss Parliament between 1995 and 2014 from a gender equality perspective? Content analysis and a standardized scoring methodology are used to analyse the leave policy proposals submitted by Members of Parliament. The analysis reveals that only a few proposals would create incentives for fathers to use these leaves and would therefore contribute to promoting gender equality. The article discusses future challenges for the development of leave policies in Switzerland from a gender equality perspective.

TI Microfinance and gender inequality: cross-country evidence
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Microfinance enables poor women to engage in income-generating activities, which helps them become financially independent, strengthening their decision-making power within the household and society. Consequently, microfinance has the potential to reduce gender inequality (GI). Case-study evidence from across the developing world both supports and contradicts this hypothesis. We therefore revisit this issue using macroeconomic cross-country panel data for 64 developing economies over the period 2003-2014. We find that women's participation in microfinance is associated with a reduction in GI. However, regional interactions reveal that cultural factors are likely to influence the GI-microfinance nexus.

TI Depoliticising Gender Equality in Turbulent Times: The Case of the
   European Gender Action Plan for External Relations
SO POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW
AB Since more than a decade, the EU is confronted with a number of crises that significantly changed the environment under which the EU operates in the field of gender equality. Evidence shows, that in many European countries, the different crises have led to a deprioritisation of gender equality policies. However, the way in which the new Gender Action Plan for External Relations 2015-2020 of the European Union addresses and operationalises gender equality suggests in contrast a policy shift towards an intensified commitment and more comprehensive understanding of gender. Against this background, this article analyses, first, how the content and the conceptual orientation of gender equality policies in European Union's external relations have changed in the light of post-crisis recommendations. Second, the article scrutinises the ways in which the European Union tries to tackle the credibility crisis through increasingly intensified and operationalised policy procedures. The argument put forth is that the gender-related indicators in the Gender Action Plan translate complex societal processes into a technical data-based framework and thereby depoliticise gender equality by simulating a technocratic, evidence-based and quantified form of politics.

TI 'Gender nationalism': The new (old) politics of belonging
SO AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB This contribution takes a look at the phenomenon of 'gender-nationalism '. It argues that references about gender equality and women's rights play an important role in contemporary politics of belonging: these references are used as boundary markers in nationalist narratives, constructing the self versus the immigrant other. The contribution traces the emergence of this phenomenon in Europe, and focuses on its occurrence in recent debates. It concludes that whilst gender equality is a crucial claim that needs to be upheld in the public sphere, we also need to pay attention to intersectional mechanisms of exclusion and oppression which are at play in contemporary versions of gender nationalism.

SO REVISTA CS EN CIENCIAS SOCIALES
AB The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) defines equality and says how to achieve it. The policies propose frameworks to live equally, but: how do you do this if it is society that teaches us to be unequal? This paper provides a historical overview of progress and setbacks on gender equality. By examining this phenomenon perhaps we get to know a social reality that impacts men and women differently. Currently, progress on gender equality can be seen, but in turn, inequitable ways that continue to favor male roles over the female are manifested.

AB The article analyzes (i) how the increasing demand for empirical evidence about the economic impacts of gender equality transforms expert knowledge about gender equality in the European Union (EU) and (ii) the implications of these transformations. The article argues that the much-debated discursive economization of gender equality in the EU context is underpinned by the economization of expert knowledge about gender equality-the increasing reliance on mainstream economics to support gender equality claims. This has increased the influence of gender-biased economics knowledge and its modes of knowledge production in EU gender equality policy.

TI Shifts in gender equality and suicide: A panel study of changes over
   time in 87 countries
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Increasing gender equality remains an imperative for countries and organisations worldwide, and is associated with the improved life outcomes of men and women. Unlike many health and wellbeing indicators, death by suicide is more common among men, but suicidal behaviours are more common among women. Understanding of the relationship between gender equality and suicide is inchoate, and limited to cross-sectional work. We sought to address this gap by examining within-country changes in gender equality over time, in relation to suicide rates.
   Methods: Data from 87 countries for the years 2006-2016 were used in this analysis. Gender Equality was measured using the Gender Gap Index (GGI), produced by the World Economic Forum. Male and female suicide rates came from the World Health Organization. Fixed and random-effects unbalanced panel regression models were used, adjusting for: GDP/capita; population; urban/rural ratio; number of children/person;% unemployed; year. Models were stratified by gender.
   Results: Increasing within-country gender equality was associated with a significant reduction in suicide rates for women (Coef. -7.08, 95% CI -12.35 to -1.82, p = 0.009). For men, there was insufficient evidence that increasing within-country gender equality was associated with reduced within-country suicide rates (Coef. -5.76, 95% CI -19.40 to 7.86, p = 0.403).
   Limitations: The reporting and collection of suicide data is known to vary across countries.
   Conclusion: There is evidence that within-country increases in gender equality are associated with significant reductions in within-country suicide-rates for women. More research is needed to understand the drivers of these associations.

TI Gender Equality in Science and Technology as a Factor in Professional
   Careers
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
AB The characteristics of professional careers in the field of science and technology are examined here from the viewpoint of gender equality and justice in employment. Our analysis of career research in this field is based on approaches that focus on the structural conditions and contexts of career formation (here we analyze the data up to March 2020). Modern programs and initiatives in science and technology recognizing gender equality in professional careers at national and international levels are becoming one of the factors of these conditions. In this context, approaches that justify gender equity (the capabilities approach), and issues of positive discrimination in relation to employment and professional advancement in this area are utilized. We analyze the aspects of managing a scientific career, which, in the biographical narratives of scientists, are recognized and reconsidered as manifestations of gender inequality in the experience of familiarization with programs within the policy of gender equality in scientific activity. The analysis is based on narrative-biographical semi-structured interviews with scientists in the field of natural sciences (N=40, 2018-2019). Assessments of the manifestations of gender inequality pertain to employment, role distribution within a team in accordance with informal norms, and the balancing of professional and family roles. We conclude that with regard to gender inequality in employment in the science, the manifestations of which often go unnoticed, creating opportunities for their examination and assessment by the scientists themselves is relevant and should be regulated by scientific policy instruments. Institutional support for gender equality should happen in conjunction with support for the status and prospects of Russian science in general.

TI Gender Equality in the Post-2015 Development Agenda: Lessons from the
   MDGs
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB This article addresses some central issues for the Post-2015 Development Agenda from a Southern perspective on gender equality and women's human rights. To answer this question, it first examines what lessons can be learned from the decade or so of implementation of the MDGs. The article focuses on two 'meso' challenges: breaking down issue silos, and integration/participation. It argues that progress towards gender equality will depend on whether the larger development framework addresses central issues such as the growing inequality, informalisation and precariousness of work and incomes that have gone hand in hand with the globalisation of the past three decades. Within a framework that tackles head on the causes and consequences of rising global and national inequality, progress on women's rights requires recognition that gender inequality is pervasive across multiple and intersecting issues. Effectively addressing women's needs and rights requires the building of bridges across policy silos through the integration of issues and participation by women.

TI Corruption, gender inequality and logistics performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop and test theory-driven hypotheses on the influence of corruption and gender inequality on logistics performance. Design/methodology/approach This paper develops hypotheses based on a review of the literature and theory linking corruption, gender inequality and logistics performance. Testing the hypotheses draws on the following secondary data sources: the World Bank Logistics Performance Index, Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index and the United Nations Development Programme Gender Inequality Index. Regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses. Findings A significant direct effect is evident between corruption perceptions and perceived logistics performance. Corruption is detrimental to logistics. Further, there is evidence of an indirect effect, via gender inequality. Gender inequality is also linked directly to lower logistics performance. Gross domestic product/capita enters the analysis as a control variable.
   Social implications Gender inequality and corruption are current, global social issues. Moving forward toward equality and away from corruption are the right moves. Such moves appear to also yield better logistics. Originality/value This paper is among the first linking corruption and gender inequality to logistics performance. It shows how social issues impact logistics performance at a national level.

TI Men's reactions to gender inequality in the workplace: From relative
   deprivation on behalf of women to collective action
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Over recent years, the role of men as women's allies in the struggle for gender equality has become increasingly important. Previous research has shown that often men do not fight gender inequalities as they fail to recognize the severity of discrimination against women (e.g., in hiring). In this study (N=427), we examined whether men who experienced relative deprivation on behalf of women-a form of relative deprivation that stems from the awareness that women hold a less privileged position in society-were more motivated to engage in collective action to support gender equality in the workplace. The findings showed that men's feelings of deprivation on behalf of women were associated with a greater willingness to engage in collective action for gender equality. This relationship was sequentially mediated by two emotional reactions related to deprivation-increased guilt about gender inequalities and decreased fear of a potential backlash-and the moral conviction of acting for gender equality. These results suggest that men's awareness of gender inequality at work is an important antecedent to their acting in solidarity with women and that emotions and moral conviction are two psychological processes that turn cognition into behavior. Action to reduce gender inequalities should make men more sensitive to seeing that they hold a privileged position in society and to recognizing the pervasive and harmful nature of women's deprivation.

TI THE CHALLENGE OF IMPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL GENDER EQUALITY NORM IN IT
   ORGANIZATIONS
SO IADIS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Although digitalization across sectors drives an increasing demand for IT specialists, women still make up a small part of computing communities, IT education and work - in the US and across Europe. Our project aims to build knowledge about how this situation can be improved in the context of Nordic gender equality regimes. The "gender equality paradox" is a label for women's underrepresentation in STEM disciplines, particularly in IT, that seems to be more extreme in highly gender egalitarian cultures. It has been suggested that the paradox is a result of women's choices in wealthy countries with a high degree of individual freedom. Our project highlights another side to this paradox, as we explore attitudes towards women's underrepresentation among IT employers and organizations. The analysis reveals mixed signals from the organizations: while they recognize the low proportion of women in IT, they simultaneously negotiate the meaning of women's underrepresentation in IT in ways that do not make gender equality in IT a goal, thus it leaves little space for gender equality actions. While this can have major consequences for women's careers in computing and IT work, it also illustrates a central mechanism of the "gender equality paradox" characterized by a widely accepted norm of gender equality existing alongside employers' skepticism to the goal of gender balance in computing. Here we analyze the organizations' approaches towards gender equality ideals through the notion of "discursive resources", which points to how individuals translate these ideals in light of their own organizational context. Furthermore, this highlights the importance of taking the organizations' "discursive resources" into account when suggesting solutions to increased awareness of and engagement for gender equality in the IT sector.

AB Interest in women's labour force participation, economic security and pay equity received substantial media and public policy attention throughout 2019, largely attributable to the federal election and the Australian Labor Party platform, which included a comprehensive suite of policies aimed at advancing workplace gender equality. Following the Australian Labor Party's unexpected loss at the polls, however, workplace gender equality largely faded from the political agenda. In this annual review, we cover key gender equality indicators in Australia, examine key election promises made by both major parties, discuss the implications of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety for the female-dominated aged care workforce, and provide a gendered analysis on recent debates and developments surrounding the 'future of work' in Australia.

It does so by establishing a frame for the critical assessment of the impacts of such an institutional design. Moreover, by using interviews and data on the behavior of committee members, it demonstrates the advantages of applying a mixed method within a field that has mostly relied on participant interviews. A systematic analysis of the impact of the Danish Committee on Gender Equality shows that although this particular committee has not succeeded in adding the perspective of gender equality to legislation, it has increased parliamentary control with the government. Furthermore, it has enabled much better interaction between parliament and civil society organizations.

Orthodox mapping is considered to be a useful way of portraying the continuing universal nature of gender inequality in employment alongside the wide, national and regional variations in the extent of the inequality. The maps also illustrate the growing feminization of employment in western Europe and the rapidity with which gender roles are changing. However, while reference is made to the gendered welfare regimes, gender arrangements and differentiated patriarchy explanations of gender inequality, caution is urged in terms of drawing inferences from changing gender roles in employment to wider changes in gender relations.

TI WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY: REPOSITIONING GENDER
   (IN)EQUALITY AS MEN'S BURDEN OR MEN'S RESPONSIBILITY
SO TPM-TESTING PSYCHOMETRICS METHODOLOGY IN APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY
AB The responsibility for addressing gender inequality typically falls on women. More recently, evidence has shown that solidarity-based framing is a starting point for increasing men's support of gender equality efforts. This paper moves beyond these women's issue and solidarity approaches to examine whether positioning men as being either responsible for addressing inequality (Experiment 1; N = 258) or being directly affected by inequality themselves (Experiment 2; N = 543), shapes men's (and women's) attitudes toward male and female leaders promoting gender equality and their mobilization toward this cause. In Experiment 1, men evaluated male and female leaders as more prototypical and higher in leadership identification under common cause compared to women's issue frames (and also compared to men's responsibility frames for leadership identification). In Experiment 2 all participants evaluated (male) leaders more positively under common cause and covictimization framing compared to men's victimization framing. Contrary to predictions, men's (Experiments 1-2) and women's (Experiment 2) collective action intent remained stable across message frames. Yet when it comes to mobilization, in Experiment 2 women showed solidarity more readily (i.e., were committed to gender equality across frames) while men's mobilization was dependent on men being directly victimized. We discuss practical and theoretical implications of mobilizing support for gender equality, and important caveats of increasing male allies' involvement in the movement.

TI Gender equality plans (GEPs) as a framework to devise gender equality
   measures for disaster research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB Recently, disaster scholars have started to take a critical stance toward how disaster research is conducted and the extent to which disaster studies are inclusive toward research participants and researchers from diverse backgrounds. This article endorses an inward gaze to reflect on the dynamics playing out within the disaster research in terms of gender imbalances. Importantly, the article is not a review of the studies on gender issues in disaster contexts; rather it seeks to put forth a strategy to illuminate and redress the dynamics of inequality within the disaster research community, taking the gendered power relationships as a starting point. The article starts from the consideration that, despite an increased attention on the gendered dimensions of humanitarian crises, gendered aspects within the disaster research teams and organizations have been largely neglected. In particular, there is a lack of data pertaining to the gender presence and gender biases in the disaster research workforce and in the production of disaster-related knowledge. In order to fill this gap, a systematic plan to collect pertinent gender data and implement appropriate measures is needed. Here, we propose to adopt the framework of the gender equality plans (GEPs), an instrument promoted by the European Commission to advance gender equality in research performing organizations. The actions proposed in this paper seek to encourage reflections on the structural bases upon which disaster research is organized and to support the identification of the aspects we want to preserve and of those we need to change.

   Influence of Increased Gender Equality on Terrorism in Turkey
SO WOMEN & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB Gender inequality has been empirically linked to the incidence of terrorism, as a motivator for women's involvement in terrorism, and political and social violence more generally. Although these studies demonstrate that advances in gender equality on average decrease terrorism, it is unclear how these influences translate to individual nations or conflicts. Because Turkey has witnessed consistent but unequal regional advances in gender equality, it provides an ideal setting to examine how these developments have influenced terrorist violence. Analyzing data from Turkey's 81 provinces from 2000-2013, this study finds important regional differences in the influence of gender equality on terrorism.

TI What is needed to promote gender equality in the cultural sector?
   Responses from cultural professionals in Catalonia
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
AB Despite the growing evidence of inequalities related to the presence, promotion and labor conditions of women in the cultural sector, as well as the factors that cause these inequalities, there is still a lack of research and consensus on the key measures that should be applied to reduce the effect of these inequalities. The aim of this study was to identify intervention measures, from both the public and private sectors, that will help promote gender equality in the Catalan context. In a three-round survey using the Delphi technique, cultural professionals were asked about the most appropriate measures to achieve gender equality in cultural employment. In this regard, this article presents an innovative data-gathering methodology for cultural studies, involving diverse stakeholders from the public, private and civil society sectors and contributing to informed decision-making processes. The highest priority measure identified in both the public and private sectors was related to compliance with legal provisions regarding the recognition of equal pay for work of equal value between women and men. The adoption of and compliance with laws and regulations aimed at advancing gender equality and the establishment of measures related to the reconciliation of work with family and social life was also prioritized highly by most professionals. The full set of measures proposed by cultural experts and affected groups can help to effectively address gender inequalities in the Catalan context and provide ideas for other local and national settings.

TI Intersections and Inconsistencies. Framing Gender in Right-Wing Populist
   Discourses in Austria
SO NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH
AB The paper contributes to the discussion on (re) framing processes of gender equality focusing in particular on right-wing populist discourses in Austria. Our frame analysis of 50 texts published by four right-wing (extremist) parties and movements reveals that traditional (family) values, women's "free choice", and LGBT rights play important roles in right-wing populist (re) framing processes of gender equality. Our data also show notable inconsistencies with regard to the meanings attached to gender and gender equality within the discourses studied. For instance, right-wing populists are, on the one hand, concerned with the protection of "the traditional family"which means being against e.g. same-sex marriage and emphasizing women's wish to stay at home. On the other hand, these same actors argue against immigration by using gender arguments in a different and even contradictorymanner, claiming that e.g. Muslim men are bound by their "culture" to discriminate women and LGBT people. Our intersectional approach, analytically focusing on different meanings that gender equality acquires at the intersections with ethnicity, nationality, religion/culture, and sexuality, shows that within right-wing populist discourses inconsistencies in the framing of gender and gender equality arise in relation to the shifting meanings attributed to the essential dichotomyof "us"versus "them". While the discursive construction of antagonistic positions is essential for right-wing populism, the groups/people designated to fill these "slots"might differ according to topic. We argue that "intersectionality from above"is one of populists' instruments to gloss over inconsistencies and to (re) frame gender equality in an on-going process of (re) negotiations of meanings.

Using an ecological approach, I test for significant associations between national-level gender inequality and intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV). I use multi-level generalized linear modeling to analyze the responses of 9,126 women from 29 countries in the International Dating Violence Study. I find that while controlling for other risk factors, gender inequality is significantly associated with increased odds of having experienced severe, but not minor, forms of IPSV.

TI Political Ideology Outdoes Personal Experience in Predicting Support for
   Gender Equality
SO POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Indices of gender equality provide an inconsistent picture of current gender inequality in countries with relatively high equality. We examined women's and men's subjectively perceived gender inequality and their support for gender equality in the general population and in politicians, respectively, in three countries with relatively high gender equality: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany (total N = 1,612). In both women's and men's perceptions, women were treated more unequally than men. However, the inequality that women perceived was larger than the inequality men perceived. Additionally, women reported they personally experience less inequality than women as a group (person-group discrepancy). Finally, women's and men's left/liberal (vs. right/conservative) political ideology turned out to be a relatively more powerful predictor of support for gender equality than perceived personal and societal inequality. We discuss reasons for why political ideology emerged as the strongest predictor of equality support and sketch out implications for policy efforts toward promoting gender equality.

TI Countries with women inequalities have higher stroke mortality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
AB Background Stroke outcomes can differ by women's legal or socioeconomic status.
   Aim We investigated whether differences in women's rights or gender inequalities were associated with stroke mortality at the country-level.
   Methods We used age-standardized stroke mortality data from 2008 obtained from the World Health Organization. We compared female-to-male stroke mortality ratio and stroke mortality rates in women and men between countries according to 50 indices of women's rights from Women, Business and the Law 2016 and Gender Inequality Index from the Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme. We also compared stroke mortality rate and income at the country-level.
   Results In our study, 176 countries with data available on stroke mortality rate in 2008 and indices of women's rights were included. There were 46 (26.1%) countries where stroke mortality in women was higher than stroke mortality in men. Among them, 29 (63%) countries were located in Sub-Saharan African region. After adjusting by country income level, higher female-to-male stroke mortality ratio was associated with 14 indices of women's rights, including differences in getting a job or opening a bank account, existence of domestic violence legislation, and inequalities in ownership right to property. Moreover, there was a higher female-to-male stroke mortality ratio among countries with higher Gender Inequality Index (r=0.397, p<0.001). Gender Inequality Index was more likely to be associated with stroke mortality rate in women than that in men (p<0.001).
   Conclusions Our study suggested that the gender inequality status is associated with women's stroke outcomes.

TI Gender Inequality and the Rule of Law
SO HAGUE JOURNAL ON THE RULE OF LAW
AB This study examines the hypothesis that adherence the rule of law is a cross-cutting determinant of gender inequality. We gathered data from previously published sources to calculate the correlation between gender inequality and the rule of law, using a cross-sectional and ecological design. Data was collected between 2017 and 2019 from United Nations (gender inequality, health, and economic data); political freedom from Freedom House; income inequality from the World Bank; and adherence to the rule of law from the World Justice Project. We found an association between gender inequality and adherence to the rule of law, controlling for economic inequality, population, GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, education, ethnolinguistic fractionalization, and political rights and civil liberties. While the design of the study does not permit causality to be inferred, we propose here three plausible causal mechanisms, borne out in other studies, which suggest it: (1) weak enforcement of rights; (2) legal frameworks that tolerate violence against women; and (3) corruption.

TI Learning gender equality: how women's protest influences youth gender
   attitudes
SO POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES
AB Current comparative analyses of gender attitudes among adolescents largely focus on individual-level characteristics. Understudied is the role of women's protest on adolescents' gender attitudes. This paper investigates how women's protests reported in national news shape young citizens' gender attitudes across 32 countries. Using the IEA International Civic and Citizenship Study survey data (2009), we test whether women's protests have a positive impact on egalitarian gender attitudes among adolescents. Our multi-level models demonstrate that girls are more egalitarian in their gender attitudes than boys. The gap between boys and girls changes depending on the level of gender equality in a country. In countries with lower gender equality, the gender gap increases slightly as the number of women's protests increases, although the difference is not significant. In countries where gender equality is already high, the gender gap is significant at all levels of protest but narrows as protest increases. Our findings expand scholars' understanding of how protest influences public opinion among young people and have important implications for how gender attitude change occurs and whether women's protest serves as a tool for developing gender equality.

TI TROUBLING GENDER EQUALITY: REVISITING GENDER EQUALITY WORK IN THE FAMOUS
   NORDIC MODEL COUNTRIES
SO EDUCATION AS CHANGE
AB This article concerns gender equality work, that is, those educational and workplace activities that involve the promotion of gender equality. It is based on research conducted in Sweden and Finland, and focuses on the period during which the public sector has become more market-oriented and project-based all over the Nordic countries. The consequences of this development on gender equality work have not yet been thoroughly analysed. Our joint empirical analysis is based on discourse-analytic methodology and two previous empirical studies. By analysing interviews conducted with people involved in gender equality work, this article emphasises the effects of market-oriented and project-based gender equality work in education and working life in Sweden and in Finland. The findings highlight an alliance between projectisation and heteronormativity that acts to regulate how gender equality ought to be talked about in order for its issues to be heard. A persistently constructed 'remedy' to 'the gender equality problem' is that girls and women are positioned as 'needing' to change more than boys and men, by adopting more traditionally 'masculine manners' and choosing to work in more 'masculine sectors'. The findings also show that the constitutive forces of these discourses provide little leeway for critical perspectives.

TI Gender inequality and mental health medicalization: Sociocultural
   determining factors from the analysis of expert perceptions
SO ATENCION PRIMARIA
AB To identify the sociocultural roots that explain the higher frequency of diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety and the prescription of psychotropic drugs in women, in order to propose a preliminary explanatory framework for the investigation of gender inequalities in mental health and its medicalization. Qualitative study with a descriptive --interpretive design, through in-depth interviews conducted in January and February 2021. Interviews were held in various cities of the Basque Country, Barcelona and Madrid. 12 experts in gender and mental health from the clinical (Primary Care and Mental Health), academic and associative fields. Intentional sampling, following the snowball technique, until covering the diversity of previously identified profiles and the saturation of the discourse. An analysis of thematic content was carried out starting from a critical-realistic epistemological perspective. The main dimensions to explain gender inequalities in diagnoses of depression or anxiety and prescription of psychoactive drugs were: 1) the material and symbolic subordination of women, 2) the role of ??psi?? sciences in the pathologization of the feminine identity, 3) the epistemological and androcentric biases of biomedicine, and 4) the active agency of women in medicalization processes. The reduction of gender inequalities in the diagnoses and prescription of psychotropic drugs will require joint intervention at the clinical, community and structural levels that, from a feminist perspective, manage to reverse the socioeconomic, symbolic and epistemic vulnerability of women. ?? 2022 The Authors.

TI Women's health status and gender inequality in China
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
CT NGO Forum of the UN 4th World Conference on Women
CY AUG 31-SEP 08, 1995
CL HUAIROU, PEOPLES R CHINA
SP UN
AB This paper examines the health status of women in China by reviewing levels and trends of female mortality at several phases of a woman's life cycle focusing on infancy, girlhood, childbearing and old age. The mortality rates of Chinese women and men are compared for the period 1950-1990 as are comparisons with women in selected countries. The cause-specific death rate, expressed as a percentage of all deaths, and the burden of disease, measured in terms of the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), are used to reflect the changing patterns of female diseases and causes of deaths. Significant improvement in the health status of Chinese women since 1950 is widely acknowledged as a major achievement for a developing country with the largest population in the world, but the differentials in women's health by region and urban/rural areas are considerable. The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) indicates that the overall level of physical well-being of Chinese women has increased in recent decades, but disparity in health between men and women still exists. The Gender-Related Development Index (GDI) further reveals that China has achieved significant progress in women's health during the past four decades, but far less has been achieved with respect to gender equality overall. The final sections of the paper focus on the discussion of some health problems faced by the female population during the process of economic reform since the 1980 s. In order to promote gender equality between women and men, concerns on women's health care needs are highlighted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Decomposing Vietnamese gender equality in terms of wage distribution
SO PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB We decompose the gender wage gap in terms of wage distribution in Vietnam during 2002-2014 using two methods. The first method uses two estimated counterfactual distributions; the second uses an estimated recentred influence function. We focus on the formal sector and find evidence for a consistent gender wage gap, with the price of skills being the main contributor. In contrast, labour market discrimination does not have a crucial influence. Some gender equality gained by the distribution of skills can be explained by the rise in women's education and women's participation in specific industries, occupations and the growing private sector.

TI INTEGRATING GENDER EQUALITY IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT: THE SPANISH CASE
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
AB Public procurement, as well as constituting a means of providing goods and services, also represents a powerful legal instrument available to contracting authorities to ensure compliance with secondary or non-commercial goals. Among these secondary objectives, equality between women and men may be highlighted. The possibility of integrating social concerns into public procurement is envisaged in the Community Directives on public procurement and has also been incorporated in the legal systems of various Member States. This paper studies the inclusion of social clauses on gender equality that appear in the different phases of a procurement procedure in the Spanish Public Procurement Law (Law 30/2007, 30th October, on Public Sector Contracts).

TI The EU's Gender Equality Policies from the Perspective of Policy Frame
   Analysis
SO SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB This article deals with the political problematisation of gender inequalities in the context of the European Union's gender equality policies on a supranational level. Based on the concept of transnational advocacy networks (TAN), the first part of the article presents the European Women's Lobby and units at the European Commission dealing with gender equality policies as two key actors in TAN that promote gender equality issues within the structures of the EU. The article then moves on to describe policy frame analysis as an approach to analysing the way in which the gender inequalities addressed by these actors are politically problematised in three policy documents connected to the European Commission's 'Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010'. The analysis focuses on the main frames in these documents that legitimise the existence of an independent policy field concerned with gender equality at the EU level and discusses the ramifications of these frames for the promotion of gender equality, for example, how certain policy measures might lead to different outcomes when promoted within different frames.

TI Constitutional Transformation and Gender Equality: The Case of the
   Post-Arab Uprisings North African Constitutions
SO OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES
AB The recognition of gender equality has become one of the most important trends in contemporary constitutional law. Nonetheless, a crucial question lingers: is it leading to material constitutional transformation? In order to better understand it, this article presents a case study on the constitutional reconfigurations undergone in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt after the Arab uprisings. The main vectors of constitutional change are identified from a descriptive-analytical perspective. Even if they kept idiosyncratic elements of persistent discrimination, the new charters were inserted in the globalised trends of constitutional design, bringing about a strong formal expansion of gender equality rights. On the whole, however, little material progress has been made. This suboptimal material transformation is explained by means of research arguments framed in legal evolutionist theories. Finally, the article elucidates why the greater constitutional verbosity in the recognition of gender equality did not translate into greater parity.

TI Social Inclusion or Gender Equality? Political Discourses on Parental
   Leave in Finland and Sweden
SO SOCIAL INCLUSION
AB During the 2010s, both Finland and Sweden made advancements in their parental leave systems by widening the right to paid parental leave to a greater diversity of family constellations and investing in gender-equal leave distribution through longer leave periods reserved for the father. However, in the latter respect, Sweden has remained more successful than Finland. This article analyses government and political party discourses in Finland and Sweden during the 2010s in pursuit of an explanation to this difference and for understanding how ideas on social inclusion and gender equality have been used to drive, or block, policy reforms in the field of parental leave. The results show that the parental leave discourses have become influenced by ideas on social inclusion and gender equality in both countries, but in somewhat different ways. While gender equality has retained a stronger position in the Swedish discourse and its policy, social inclusion, and notably the rights of same-sex parents, have become more visible in the Finnish. However, the results also show that both ideas have remained contested on a party level, especially by confessional and nationalist-populist parties.

TI Gender equality in employment in Saudi Arabia: a relational perspective
SO CAREER DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine gender inequality in Saudi Arabia by using a relational perspective that takes into account the interrelated nature of the multilevel factors that influence this phenomenon.
   Design/methodology/approach A total of 21 in-depth interviews with female employees in Saudi Arabia were conducted and analysed using a thematic analysis.
   Findings The findings show how the interplay of factors on macro, meso and micro levels influences equal opportunities for women in Saudi Arabia, such as religio-cultural factors, the social power of wasta, the notions of female modesty and family honour and issues related to gender segregation, discrimination and harassment at work. Moreover, Saudi women's experiences are varied on the basis of social class, family status and other dimensions of individual identity, adding to a growing body of intersectional research. The paper highlights the role of male guardianship system as well as the intersection of gender and class in pushing gender equality forward.
   Originality/value This study stresses the interrelated nature of the multilevel factors that affect gender equality and highlights the important role of individual agency and resilience.

TI Gender equality in India hit by illiteracy, child marriages and
   violence: a hurdle for sustainable development
SO PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Introduction: Gender equality is fundamental to accelerate sustainable development. It is necessary to conduct gender analyses to identify sex and gender-based differences in health risks. This study aimed to find the gender equality in terms of illiteracy, child marriages and spousal violence among women based on data from National Family Health Survey 2015-16 (NFHS-4). Methods: This was a descriptive analysis of secondary data of ever-married women onto reproductive age from 15 states and 3 UTs in India of the first phase of NFHS-4. Gender gap related to literacy and child marriage among urban and rural area was compared. Results: in rural area all states except Meghalaya and Sikkim had the significantly higher percentage of women's illiteracy as compared to male. Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had higher illiterate women, 53.7% and 48.6% as compared to male, 24.7% and 21.5% respectively (P < 0.000). Child marriages were found to be significantly higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas in four most populated states. Conclusion: There is a gender gap between illiteracy with women more affected in rural areas with higher prevalence of child marriages and poor utilization of maternal health services. Also, violence against women is showing an upward trend with declining sex-ratio at birth.

The first section describes the transformations of the relationship between care and gender (as equality between men and women became a major goal of democratic societies). The second section stresses the tensions thus generated, especially the "care crisis". Drawing on previous recent empirical studies on different public policy models in the domain of long-term care in various European Union countries, this article identifies the conditions under which a right to care is likely to promote gender equality.

TI Does Gender Equality Influence Volunteerism? A Cross-National Analysis

SO VOLUNTAS
AB Research regarding the roles of women in society and in political and social organizations is large, with scholars focusing on the likelihood of political and social engagement. However, few of these studies examine the influence of gender on participation in voluntary organizations by utilizing cross-national data. This study intends to analyze the influence of gender on the type of organization that an individual volunteers and on whether these volunteering habits are influenced by the gender equality in a country. Is there segregation in the type of organizations men and women volunteer? Do women in more gender equal societies have similar volunteering patterns as men, or does the difference continue in volunteering? For this study, we use the World Values Survey from 1999 to 2002, to identify the differences in the types of organizations that men and women volunteer and discuss the impact gender equality has on these volunteering patterns.

TI Gender inequality in asset ownership and women's food security in
   sub-Saharan Africa
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB Unequal asset rights remain an important driver of gender inequality and food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using cross-sectional data from 31 SSA countries, this study examines the effect of gender inequality in asset ownership on women's food security in the region. The seemingly unrelated (SUR) bivariate probit framework has been adopted in analysing the data. This approach is used for addressing the possible endogeneity bias that occurs when the dependent variable and regressor are both endogenous and binary. The major finding of this study reveals that gender inequality in asset ownership increases women's risk of facing food insecurity. The aforementioned is more pronounced for women who are undereducated, live in rural areas, and suffer various forms of discrimination. It is therefore important that more egalitarian laws on asset ownership and inheritance be adopted in all SSA countries. This will significantly increase women's specific food security and thus contribute to improving inclusiveness in these countries.

TI The fantasy of the new man: norm-critique, vulnerability and victimhood
SO NORMA
AB In this article, the Swedish gender-equality initiative Men and Gender Equality is analyzed. The goal is to empirically examine some of the affective dimensions at play in the ways in which a 'norm-critical' perspective on masculinity is articulated as a solution to gender equality. Our analysis reveals ambivalences operating within the initiative's use of norm-critical perspectives. Despite the apparent intention to offer men the hope of emancipating themselves from sedimented practices and modes of being men, these end up potentially reinforcing certain assumptions and aspects of extant society. They include (neo-)liberal assumptions about individual responsibility as well as post-feminist and anti-feminist discursive logics and tropes. With a theoretical focus on fantasy, we show how a reformist attempt to reimagine what male identities could be ends up perpetuating certain myths and assumptions that work against the emancipatory vision nurtured within such discourses.

TI The generational perspective of gender gap in wages and education in
   southern Europe
SO REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY
AB This paper aims at investigating gender differentials in wages and education from an intergenerational perspective across four developed countries of southern Europe, considering the generational transmission of preferences and the gender equality systems and policies. Measures of gender inequality in wages and education permit exploring the different extent to which gender gaps depend on unobserved factors, such as discrimination. A first set of discrimination indexes is computed starting from the estimation of extended Mincerian log-earnings equations, whereas a second set is based on the estimation of ordered logistic regressions on a range of personal characteristics considered to be linked to education, controlling for family background. The main results show that family background affects the degree of gender inequality more than the gender equality policies do. Gender disparities in professional outcomes can be partly due to women's preferences vs. lower-paid jobs because of the incomplete efficacy of national systems.

TI Global Business Norms and Islamic Views of Women's Employment
SO BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY
AB This article examines the issue of gender equality within Islam in order to develop an ethical framework for businesses operating in Muslim majority countries. We pay attention to the role of women and seemingly inconsistent expectations of Islamic and Western societies with regard to appropriate gender roles. In particular, we contrast a mainstream Western liberal individualist view of freedom and equality-the capability approach, used here as an illustration of mainstream Western liberalism-with an egalitarian Islamic view on gender equality. While the article identifies an opportunity for this particular approach to reform patriarchal interpretations and practices of Islam toward gender egalitarian interpretations and practices, it also contests the notions of adaptation and well-being inherent within the capability approach. We suggest that a dialectical approach to understanding the relationships among religion, culture, and business provides a better guide to responsible business action in Muslim Majority countries than does the capability approach.

TI WOMEN IN THE CHANGING KIBBUTZ ECONOMY

AB This article examines within the framework of feminist theories how change decisions in the kibbutz communities, which are seemingly gender-neutral, have a significant impact on the gender system. A. random sample of 790 kibbutz members representing the 250 secular kibbutz communities was sampled for this purpose. The findings show that women's attitudes toward change are quite similar to men's, but fewer women than men feel that the kibbutz way of life is suitable for them. The conclusions of the article are that: ( 1) changes that are not aimed specifically at gender equality, would not bring it as a by-product. On the contrary, they might even make the situation worse: (2) while a combination of high technology and good economic situation might cover up gender inequalities. a sudden change in the economic situation would unravel and exacerbate them; and (3) the exclusion of gender equality as one of the goals for survival and the concentration on economic goals alone increases gender inequality.

SO AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
AB The prevalence of both gender inequality and HIV prevalence vary considerably both within all developing countries and within those in sub-Saharan Africa. We test the hypothesis that the extent of gender inequality is associated with national peak HIV prevalence. Linear regression was used to test the association between national peak HIV prevalence and three markers of gender equality - the gender-related development index (GDI), the gender empowerment measure (GEM), and the gender inequality index (GII). No evidence was found of a positive relationship between gender inequality and HIV prevalence, either in the analyses of all developing countries or those limited to Africa. In the bivariate analyses limited to Africa, there was a positive association between the two measures of gender "equality" and peak HIV prevalence (GDI: coefficient 28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-46.8; GEM: coefficient 54.8, 95% CI 20.5-89.1). There was also a negative association between the marker of gender "inequality" and peak HIV prevalence (GII: coefficient -66.9, 95% CI -112.8 to -21.0). These associations all disappeared on multivariate analyses. We could not find any evidence to support the hypothesis that variations in the extent of gender inequality explain variations in HIV prevalence in developing countries.

AB The article discusses the gender inequalities in entrepreneurship opportunities in Georgian reality. It represents the analysis of existing quantitative and qualitative studies with regard gender inequalities. Desk research method is used to discuss the research question-what is the extent of gender inequalities in work and employment in Post-soviet Georgia. As statistical evidence and rigorous studies conducted by researchers and non-governmental organizations suggested gender inequalities in employment, education and income distributions still prevails in Georgia. Not all groups in society have equal access to employability and entrepreneurial opportunities. Majority in Georgia formally shares the idea of gender equality. Certain percentage of population is in favor of traditional distribution of the gender roles. To overcome the disparity gap between men and women in social life effective mechanism such a quoting is needed. In many developed countries quoting usually is the standard in modern society. Unfortunately the gender hierarchy is still top issue in Georgian families, in political as well as in business space. Women's Entrepreneurship is effected by existing stereotypes as entrepreneurship is a largely a product of environment rat. Social values, culture, government policies, the political system, technology, economic conditions, customs and laws influence entrepreneurship.

TI Gender equality and poverty in Ghana: implications for poverty reduction
   strategies
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB Poverty trends in Ghana show a decline over the last two decades. However, the period also shows evidence of the intensification of vulnerability and exclusion among some groups, including women. Among several variables accounting for women's vulnerability to poverty are gender inequalities, which it is argued, undermines development and the prospects for improving standards of living. Therefore it has been suggested that policies, which aim at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development must integrate gender equality, equity and women's empowerment in its goals. Despite these, the interconnections between a reduction in gender inequality and a reduction in poverty are complex. The paper explores the gender dimensions of poverty in Ghana, and how gender inequalities are manifested and implicated in the reproduction of poverty. It also assesses the extent to which these have been taken into account in poverty reduction strategies and policies to enhance the situation of women. It concludes that if strategies to engender poverty reduction programmes are to be sustainable it is important to recognize unequal gender relations and the structures of power that women confront at all levels in Ghana and how these increase women's vulnerability to poverty.

TI Gender Equality Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB The European Court of Human Rights has recently proclaimed gender equality as one of the key underlying principles of the Convention. However, the Court's jurisprudence has been largely impotent in challenging gender discrimination in the member states. This article explores tire reasons why this is so by analysing Article 14 sex discrimination jurisprudence and the application of the principle of gender equality in the 'Islamic headscarf cases. Tire author argues that reasons lie in the Court's formalistic conceptualization of discrimination, and simplistic and paternalistic understanding of gender equality, which is insensitive to intersectionality of discrimination. The author proposes an understanding of gender equality as challenging (multiple and intersectional) forms of disadvantage. Under this approach, the question in equality jurisprudence would riot be whether there was unjustified differential treatment, but rather whether the law or practice at issue perpetuated or produced subordination of women (as defined by other identity characteristics) and unequal gender (and other) relations.

TI Does the Gender Mix Influence Collective Bargaining on Gender Equality?
   Evidence from France
SO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB Gender equality at work has become in recent years a priority for governments. In France, collective bargaining is the main lever to achieve progress on gender equality issues. In a two-tier bargaining framework, industries and firms are required by law to negotiate on the reduction of gender inequalities. Using firm-level survey data on labor relations issues combined with administrative data, this paper seeks to better understand the dynamics of collective bargaining on gender equality at the firm level by questioning the role played by the gender mix. We find that gender diversity favors gender equality bargaining at the firm level. Underrepresentation and overrepresentation of women reduce the probability of firms negotiating an agreement on gender equality. The introduction of sanctions in the recent period has prompted low-feminized firms to negotiate more on gender equality but had little impact on highly feminized firms.

TI Gender inequalities during COVID-19
SO GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
AB The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to progress toward gender equality and, instead, exacerbated existing gender inequalities across domains-from gendered divisions of labour to economic stability. In this paper we document some of the most glaring gender inequalities that have arisen in the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how social psychological theories and research-including work on gender stereotypes and roles, responses to threat, precarious masculinity, perceptions of risk, and backlash-can help to explain the roots of these inequalities. In doing so, we use a broad definition of gender and consider relevant intersections of identity. Finally, we present three key considerations for research on gender inequalities moving forward. Namely, the need for social psychologists to (a) challenge binary conceptualizations of gender, (b) broaden the focus of research on gender inequalities, and (c) adopt an intersectional lens to address systemic inequalities in the wake of COVID-19.

TI Uncertainty and gender inequality: A global investigation
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB There is increasing interest in the consequences of uncertainty, yet research on its effects on gender equality is scarce. This study investigates the impact of uncertainty on gender inequality using a sample of 100 countries over the period 1991-2017. The analysis is carried out for 22 indicators of gender inequality in four dimensions (employment, health, education, rights) and five uncertainties (domestic uncertainty, world uncertainty, world trade uncertainty, global economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk). First, uncertainty appears to increase gender inequality in employment by affecting vulnerable employment, unemployment, and self-employment; and by reducing waged and salaried employment, numbers of contributing family workers, labour force participation, and employment in industry and services. Second, uncertainty is found to be very harmful in its effect on gender equality in health, as it decreases life expectancy and survival to age 65, and increases the mortality of women. Third, uncertainty improves gender equality in education, as it increases school enrolment at primary and tertiary levels. Fourth, uncertainty improves the Women, Business and the Law Index, but has mixed effects on women's economic, political, and social rights.(c) 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB #MeToo has raised public awareness on issues of sexual harassment and misconduct at an unprecedented scale, nurturing hopes for sustainable change also in terms of gender equality. We use the concept of politicization to assess the potential for change which #MeToo might have induced in the broader print media discourse on gender equality issues. We analyse Australia as an arguably difficult case due to its conservative political and media system, thus offering political activism rather dire prospects of public resonance. We assess a total of two years of media coverage in the eight largest newspapers (October 2016 - September 2018), combining automated content analysis with manual claims analysis. Our results speak to the societal debate on gender equality as well as the potential of online social movements to change mainstream discourses and social realities.

Specifically, this study estimates the effects of tourism on gender equality in the labour market using a panel dataset consisting of 143 countries over the period 2006 to 2017. I find evidence of a positive relationship between tourism and gender equality in the labour market. However, the impact of tourism is not uniform across the sample. For instance, the results imply that tourism is positively correlated with gender equality in developed countries, has an inverse relationship with gender equality in Sub-Saharan Africa, and has no impact on gender equality in the Middle East and North Africa. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB These analyses explore the relationship between gender inequality and subjective well-being. The hypothesis was tested as to whether societal gender inequality is related to the size of gender differences in subjective well-being in various societies. Results come from comparative data sets (World Values Survey, involving 57 countries; OASIS project, involving Norway, England, Germany, Spain and Israel). The size of gender differences varied with the extent of societal gender inequality and the cultural attitudes regarding gender equality in different countries. Including individual resources like education and income in the analyses reduced the size of gender and country differences. Gender differences in subjective well-being could therefore be related to gender specific access to goal relevant resources.

TI Doing gender equality and undoing gender inequality-A practice theory
   perspective
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Many of the efforts made by organizations to deal with gender inequalities fail to have the desired impact. This is not only because these efforts are undermined by individuals who disagree with them, nor because individuals do not perceive gender inequalities to be a problem. Rather, the issue is that gender equality practices may be embedded in an organizational context where other practices counteract gender equality. By means of a 17-month-long ethnographic study conducted at a technical university in Sweden, the interaction between gender equality practices and gender inequality practices has been identified. It is shown that gender equality practices are themselves based on either questionable assumptions (e.g., that increasing the number of women in senior roles will make a difference), or in an attempt to avoid blaming the victim, on reducing the salience of gendered categorization from which gendered inequalities can be adequately challenged. By focusing on the nexus of practices that move beyond equality work, two practices that undermine gender equality work have been identified, that is, a data-driven approach to change work and a preference for simple solutions. The conclusion drawn alerts us to the fact that even practices that do not seem related to gender equality work can have an impact on the success or failure of the gender equality work of the organization. This in turn may imply that the institutionalized underpinnings of the organization need to be changed, for example, the belief that more data will help us to find more solutions, or that there are practices out there that can be implemented to wash away gender inequality.

TI Cultural Variations in the Sexual Marketplace: Gender Equality
   Correlates With More Sexual Activity
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Sexual economics theory assumes that heterosexual communities can be analyzed as marketplaces in which men offer women resources such as love, respect, money, and commitment in exchange for sex. In response to economic, political, and other disadvantages, women collectively restrict their sexuality to maintain a low supply relative to male demand, thereby ensuring a high price. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that sexual norms and practices would be more restrictive in countries marked by gender inequality than in countries where the genders were more equal. An international online sex survey (N>317,000) yielded four measures of sexual activity, and 37 nations' means on all four measures were correlated with independent (World Economic Forum) ratings of gender equality. Consistent with predictions, relatively high gender equality was associated with more casual sex, more sex partners per capita, younger ages for first sex, and greater tolerance/approval of premarital sex.

SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB The post-cold war rule of law agenda in sub-Saharan Africa has not translated into reforms that enhance gender equality. The focus of reform efforts has reflected a post-cold war emphasis on creating a suitable legal and institutional environment for the market. In this climate any gains for gender equality have been limited and hard won. The main shortcomings are: gains in constitutional rights have had limited practical reach; official discussion of gender inequality in property remains disconnected from relevant broader processes such as restructuring of financial institutions; the reform agenda has not engaged with informal institutions, yet these have significant impact on gender relations; there has been relative under-investment in non-commercial judicial reform; and changes to labour regulation have been effected through sub-legislative and non-transparent processes and have not been interrogated for their failure to benefit workers in general, and in sectors dominated by women in particular.

TI What explains gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS prevalence in sub-Saharan
   Africa? Evidence from the demographic and health surveys
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Women are disproportionally affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The determinants of gender inequality in HIV/AIDS may vary across countries and require country-specific interventions to address them. This study aimed to identify the socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics underlying gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS in 21 SSA countries.
   Methods: We applied an extension of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to data from Demographic and Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys to quantify the differences in HIV/AIDS prevalence between women and men attributable to socio-demographic factors, sexual behaviours, and awareness of HIV/AIDS. We decomposed gender inequalities into two components: the percentage attributable to different levels of the risk factors between women and men (the "composition effect") and the percentage attributable to risk factors having differential effects on HIV/AIDS prevalence in women and men (the "response effect").
   Results: Descriptive analyses showed that the difference between women and men in HIV/AIDS prevalence varied from a low of 0.68 % (P = 0.008) in Liberia to a high of 11.5 % (P < 0.001) in Swaziland. The decomposition analysis showed that 84 % (P < 0.001) and 92 % (P < 0.001) of the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS among women in Uganda and Ghana, respectively, was explained by the different distributions of HIV/AIDS risk factors, particularly age at first sex between women and men. In the majority of countries, however, observed gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS were chiefly explained by differences in the responses to risk factors; the differential effects of age, marital status and occupation on prevalence of HIV/AIDS for women and men were among the significant contributors to this component. In Cameroon, Guinea, Malawi and Swaziland, a combination of the composition and response effects explained gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS prevalence.
   Conclusions: The factors that explain gender inequality in HIV/AIDS in SSA vary by country, suggesting that country-specific interventions are needed. Unmeasured factors also contributed substantially to the difference in HIV/AIDS prevalence between women and men, highlighting the need for further study.

TI Gender, development and human rights: exploring global governance
SO GEOGRAPHY
AB This article draws together work on human rights and development agendas to explore the operation of global governance mechanisms. It uses three examples that relate to attempts to achieve gender equality in order to investigate the challenges of universal human rights. Globally-agreed development targets and international conventions suggest a shared understanding of, and commitment to, gender equality. However, looking at sexual and reproductive health, violence against women, and girls' education reveals the importance of a geographical approach that acknowledges spatial and scalar differences.

TI Informal Institutions, Institutional Change, and Gender Equality
SO POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB This paper makes two claims: insights from gender research improve understandings of informal institutions and institutional change, and studying informal institutions helps scholars understand the gap between formal institutional change and outcomes. Informed by institutional analysis and feminist institutionalist scholarship, it explores the relationship between informal institutions, institutional change, and gender equality, using gender equality to scrutinize issues central to institutional change, demonstrating that institutional analyses improve when gender dynamics are incorporated. Showing the gendering of power relations highlights power in institutional change in new ways, improving understandings of why institutional change rarely happens as intended by institutional designers.

TI The influence of gendered emotional relations on gender equality in
   sport governance
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
AB The aim of this article is to investigate the influence of gendered emotional relations on gender equality in the governance of Australian sport organizations. Theoretically the study draws on the concept of a gender regime, a pattern of gender relations characterized by four interwoven dimensions of social life: production, power, emotions, and symbolism. This article reports on two case studies: sport boards C and E. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the two CEOs and nine directors of two Australian national sport organizations, sport C and sport E. Sport board C exhibited a gender regime of masculine hegemony in transition while sport board E had a regime of gender mainstreaming in progress. Supportive emotional relations between directors offered positive prospects for gender equality in the governance of sport organizations; however, they needed to operate in conjunction with other gender dimensions.

TI Colonial legacy and gender inequality in Uzbekistan
SO CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
AB This article examines how the historical interaction between colonizer and colonized influenced gender inequality in the Central Asian state of Uzbekistan. The study demonstrates that the interaction had cultural and structural components that contributed to the establishment of gender conservatism as a national virtue. After the failure of other initiatives in the region, the Soviets launched a massive unveiling ritual in Uzbekistan that led to widespread resistance, including a wave of murders of unveiled women. At the same time, the Soviets left in place local patriarchal networks that reinforced this gender conservatism. To underscore the critical nature of these interactions and their variability, the study includes evidence from neighboring Kazakhstan, a nomadic society where women did not veil and where local networks were disrupted through Soviet-led collectivization and sedentarization. The study argues that these two societies interacted differently with the Soviet modernizing project, with implications for present-day disparities in gender equality.

TI Domestic Service and Gender Equality: An Unavoidable Problem for the
   Feminist Debate on Basic Income
SO BASIC INCOME STUDIES
AB The debate on the desirability of a Basic Income (BI) for women has polarized between those who defend the measure as a way of reducing gender inequalities and those who believe that the policy could worsen the gender gap. This article argues for the former position, introducing the problemof domestic service, a paradigm of inequality not only between the genders but also among women. First, different dimensions of the "domestic service problem" are discussed in order to challenge the view that domestic service could be a "solution" for some gender inequalities. Second, it is argued that BI could significantly reduce outsourcing of reproductive work (at least in the private sphere) and could encourage women to demand equality in the home and a better public provision of care services. These effects of a BI could lead to a fairer overall system in terms of gender and class.

TI Incorporating gender inequality into income distribution research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
AB Income distribution research assumes equal sharing of resources within the household. This assumption has been criticized for leading to an underestimation of the extent of gender inequality in modern societies. In this paper two alternative methods of deriving an income distribution are presented, both of which make other assumptions about the extent of sharing of resources within households. The first is a partial sharing distribution modelled from survey data; the second is a distribution of individual income, i.e. no sharing of resources. The methods are then applied to income distribution data from the 1991 Swedish Level of Living Survey and the respective distributions are compared with the baseline distribution, assuming equal pooling of resources. As expected, the results indicate that differences between men and women increase but the extent of this increase is somewhat less than expected. Nevertheless, the analysis highlights how gender inequality can be brought into the field of income distribution.

TI Positive action plans in Italian universities: does gender really
   matter?
SO MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH
AB Purpose - The European university context reveals a high degree of gender inequality. In Italy, the overall female employment rate is significantly lower than in the rest of Europe; nevertheless, gender equality in universities is consistent with the European average. In 2006, the Italian Government required public organisations (thus state universities) to formulate positive action plans (PAPs) and disclose the positive actions planned for the following three years to promote gender equality. However, the law does not provide any guideline for the contents of the PAPs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse gender equality disclosure in PAPs to investigate whether and how Italian State Universities (ISUs) are taking a role in promoting gender equality.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses content analysis to investigate contents of gender disclosure in 28 PAPs. The authors developed a coding instrument based on the Guidelines for Gender Equality Programmes in Science.
   Findings - The paper found that most PAPs are focused on creating a favourable environment for women inside the organisation, while little attention has been paid to creating gender awareness in research and teaching activities, as well as in supporting women's leadership. The paper concludes that ISUs are failing as key players in the cultural change of the society toward gender equality.
   Originality/value - First, the paper contributes to the accounting literature by providing an analysis of accounting for gender by universities. Second, it adds to the debate on positive actions for gender equality in the university sector.

TI "We for She": Mobilising men and women to act in solidarity for gender
   equality
SO GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
AB Gender (in)equality is typically studied as a women's issue to be addressed via systemic measures (e.g., government policy). As such, research focusing on mobilising men (and women) towards achieving gender equality is rare. In contrast, this paper examines the mobilisation of both men and women towards gender equality as common cause. Experiment 1 shows that men's collective action intentions increase after reading messages that position men as agents of change towards gender equality, compared to messages that frame this issue as stemming from inadequate government policy. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that messages framing gender equality as an issue for both men and women increase men's collective action intentions, compared to when gender inequality is framed as primarily concerning women. However, this effect emerges primarily under conditions where the source of message is male (Experiment 3). Practical and theoretical implications for mobilising political solidarity in gender equality contexts are discussed.

TI The equality paradox: sexual harassment and gender inequality in a UK
   university
SO JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB The incremental progression of women into academia, as both students and staff, has disrupted, but not dismantled, cultures and practices of gender inequality. The #MeToo and other movements have engendered a focus on the prevalence, and normalization, of sexual violence on campus. Most UK studies focus on intra-student or staff-student experiences, which construct it as either a student issue or individualized transgressions. In this article, we draw on data from a convergent mixed-methods study in a UK university, in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected from staff and students on experiences of sexual harassment and perceptions of gender inequality. In this article, we focus specifically on staff data. It is argued that a cultural practice, or conducive context, of gender inequality within the institution is the scaffold for sexual harassment. This invidious circle of gender inequality and sexual harassment is mutually supportive and sustaining. Using this one university as a case study, we argue that for women in academia, parity in entry has not equated to parity of experience - with women having to navigate the paradox of the academy as an ostensibly welcoming, yet hostile, environment.

TI Beijing plus ten: An ambivalent record on gender justice
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB The 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women (the 'Beijing Conference') was a landmark in policy terms, setting a global policy framework to advance gender equality. Ten years after Beijing, in March 2005, the UN's Commission on the Status of Women presided over an intergovernmental meeting in New York to review the progress achieved on the commitments made in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. This 'Plus 10' event was decidedly low key. Its aim was not agenda setting but agenda confirming; not policy formulation but policy affirmation. Whether it proves to be part of an ongoing worldwide movement in support of gender equality, or whether it marks the decline of that process, is a question that many in international women's movements are asking. This article, drawing on research undertaken for the UNRISD report, Gender Equality: Striving for Justice in an Unequal World, reflects on the ambivalent record of progress achieved by women over the last decades and considers how the policy environment has changed over the period since the high point of global women's movements. It examines how the changing international policy and political climate over this period has given rise to new issues and challenges for those active in global women's movements.

TI A Critical Assessment of the UNDP's Gender Inequality Index
SO FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB This study critically reviews the Gender Inequality Index (GII), the new gender-related index proposed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the 2010 Human Development Report, arguing that its particular construction limits its usefulness and appropriateness as a global gender inequality index. In particular, the functional form of the index is excessively and unnecessarily confusing. Moreover, the inclusion of indicators that compare the relative performance of women vis-a-vis men, together with absolute women-specific indicators, obscures even more the interpretation of an already complicated index and penalizes the performance of low-income countries. In order to overcome some of the identified limitations, this contribution defines a new composite index of gender inequality that incorporates the GII variables but uses a much simpler functional form. The results suggest that great caution should be exercised when interpreting and using the values of the GII.

TI Tourism and gender equality: An Asian perspective
SO ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH
AB This study analyzed the impact of tourism on gender equality based on data from 36 Asian countries over the period 2006-2018, using a system generalized method of moments estimation approach. The results demonstrate that tourism has a significant positive impact on gender equality. This impact was found to be greatest and most statistically significant in east and southeast Asian countries, followed by west and central Asian countries, and finally south Asian countries. The effects of control variables with respect to the economy, education, and employment on gender equality varied significantly across three subsamples. This study could inspire further multidisciplinary research in the field of tourism and gender equality, in turn promoting the richness of this critical tourism sub-field.

TI Gender (In)equalities in the Knowledge Society
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB The article seeks answers to the question why progress towards gender equality has not turned out to be an inevitable part of the transition towards the knowledge society in Europe, in spite of efforts to ensure such an outcome. In this analysis I demonstrate how the market processes involved in the transition to the knowledge society entail opposing tendencies regarding gender inequalities. The European Union (EU) has brought into play a certain degree of convergence pressure by integrating relevant objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into the European Employment Strategy (EES) in order to pressure member states to develop its model of the knowledge society, which involves economic, employment and social progress. The main concern here is to identify the extent to which the EES and, in particular, the gender mainstreaming strategy is a tool to challenge the market forces underlying gender inequalities. It is argued that the EU's policy processes take as a given, and indeed promote the predominance of market forces in the construction of the knowledge society. Hence, the EU does not have a clear vision of what perpetuates gender inequalities and therefore what needs to be done to change them.

TI Substance use and sexual risk within the context of gender inequality in
   South Africa
SO SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
AB This study examines substance use and sexual risk within the context of gender inequality among 163 women from an urban region of South Africa who were participating in a 2004-2006 study funded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Items assessed patterns of substance use, gender inequality, risk communication, and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that economic dependence on a main partner and traditional beliefs about a woman's right to refuse sex were associated with substance use prior to or during sex with that partner. The findings demonstrate that substance abuse prior to sex may reinforce traditional beliefs and that women with more progressive beliefs about gender ideology seem better able to control their substance use in risky environments.

TI Sen's capability approach and gender inequality: Selecting relevant
   capabilities
SO FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB This paper investigates how Amartya Sen's capability approach can be applied to conceptualize and assess gender inequality in Western societies. I first argue against the endorsement of a definitive list of capabilities and instead defend a procedural approach to the selection of capabilities by proposing five criteria. This procedural account is then used to generate a list of capabilities for conceptualizing gender inequality in Western societies. A survey of empirical studies shows that women are worse off than men on some dimensions, better off on a few others, and similarly placed on yet others, while for some dimensions the evaluation is unclear. I then outline why, for group inequalities, inequalities in achieved functionings can be taken to reflect inequalities in capabilities, and how an overall evaluation could be arrived at by weighting the different capabilities.

TI The Effect of Constitutional Gender Equality Clauses
SO JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES
AB In the past decades, clauses guaranteeing gender equality have become a common feature of national constitutions. During that time, de facto gender equality also noticeably improved globally. But it is not clear whether the two trends are related. We explore the relationship between constitutional gender equality clauses and de facto gender equality using three research methods: cross-country regressions exploring the relationship between constitutional gender protections and de facto gender equality, a natural experiment exploring the forced inclusion of gender equality provisions in Japan's constitution, and a survey experiment conducted in Japan that tests the effect of information about legal commitments to gender equality on support for reforms. Across the three methods, we find no evidence that constitutional gender equality clauses improve de facto gender equality. However, we find some preliminary evidence that constitutional clauses guaranteeing maternity leave and protecting motherhood may be associated with improved gender equality.

TI GLOBAL INFLUENCES ON GENDER INEQUALITY: EVIDENCE FROM FEMALE EMPLOYMENT
   IN KOREA
SO INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Do multinational enterprises (MNEs) transfer gender-equal employment practices across borders? Using firm-level data for Korea, a country with low gender equality, we find evidence that MNEs bring their home countries' gender norms in employment with them. Foreign-acquired firms report 2-12 percentage-points higher female shares of permanent main-task workers at firm headquarters compared with nonacquired firms and the differential increases with the level of gender equality in the MNEs' home countries. We estimate that 1 to 7 percent of the productivity increase caused by foreign acquisition can be attributed to workforce reorganization that may reduce gender-based misallocations of talent.

SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB This article aims to look at the church's role in the formation and up-keeping of gender inequality, and how it shaped and constrained gender equality through a stereotypical lens. Harmful and traditional cultural practices contribute to women's suffering and often result in violence in the patriarchal context. This caused women to renegotiate their identities amidst the church's views on women and their accepted social roles. Secondly, focus will be placed on gender inequality in the African context. Lastly, I will argue that the church has to confront its views on gender inequality and how it can sanction women's equality, whereafter I will propose a metaphor for the church as the tree of gender equality.

TI Predicting gender awareness: the relevance of neo-sexism
SO JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB Gender awareness implies the recognition of discrimination against women. Contemporary studies have shown that nowadays some people deny that gender inequality exists. This affirmation is based on covert sexist beliefs, which can go unnoticed, disappearing into the cultural norms. Those who consider themselves supporters of women's rights may maintain non-traditional gender roles, but also exhibit subtle sexist beliefs. Therefore, neo-sexism is a useful concept in that it permits denial of the existence of discrimination and also upholds the belief that inequality is no longer a problem. Based on feminist identity research, this study shows that the effect of gender roles on gender awareness is mediated by neo-sexism. In women this effect was total, while in men it was partial. In this sense neo-sexism could be considered to be a factor in maintaining gender inequality and therefore an instrument of male dominance that impedes gender awareness.

AB In this article, we examine how the language spoken in a country can affect individual attitudes about gender equality and subsequently the level of legal rights afforded to women. This is because the feature of a languagespecifically whether it requires speakers to make gender distinctionscan perpetuate popular attitudes and beliefs about gender inequality. To test this argument, we first identify a correlation between the gender distinction of a language and individual gender-based attitudes among World Values Survey respondents. We then isolate the causal mechanism using an experiment involving bilingual Romanian-Hungarian speakers in Transylvania, Romania. Finally, we examine one observable implication of our argument: the effects of gender distinction of official state languages on women's rights at the national level. Our results confirm the importance of the gender distinction of language on support for gender equality and women's rights.

TI Supranational organizations and policies: perspectives from higher
   education and gender equality
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE EDUCACION COMPARADA
AB We are at a time when gender equality is understood as a matter of human rights and social justice. For this reason, in the frame of development of a democratic Europe, social movements demand a gender equality perspective in all educational stages. However, the Member States of the European Union configure their educational and gender policies around different interpretative frameworks. From the perspective of globalization and the creation of supranational organizations, this article analyzes the interpretative frameworks and values the possibility of assuming the existence of a common framework for European countries for the improvement of higher education institutions. It is concluded that the linking capacity of the European Union and the global dynamics allow the implementation of common policies to the Member States. Thus, a series of basic demands raised by feminist movements at the international level and the relevance of their integration in European universities are exposed. The problems to be addressed that are collected throughout the article and that limit the inclusion of gender equality in higher education institutions are: gender segregation, unequal distribution of power, poor access to decision-making positions, need of conciliation and attention to care, elimination of biases in research and teaching, transformation of the organizational culture and institutional support. The relevance of initial teacher training with a gender perspective is also needed for the effective transformation and the definitive eradication of inequalities.

TI With a different name, the rose is not a rose anymore: legislative
   quality and gender equality in the AKP's Turkey
SO THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LEGISLATION
AB The 1982 Turkish Constitution established a legal system aimed at ensuring state efficiency and stability more than the full respect of the rule of law. In the last decade, the latter is undergoing a democratic decay. The currently dominant Islamic Populism is reinterpreting fundamental concepts of constitutional democracy to entrench a paternalistic majoritarian vision of the law-making process and of the society. This perspective undermines the principle of gender equality, confirming the denial of LGBTQIA+ rights and increasingly favouring the principle's interpretation in line with the Islamic conception of gender complementarity. Such a limitation in women's enjoyment of equality is quite striking for a country that started the process of women's emancipation and empowerment at the beginning of the twentieth century, coevally with the establishment of the Turkish Republic. Furthermore, this drift raises doubts as to the activity of the parliamentary committee on 'Equal opportunity for women and men', established in 2009 with the duty of ensuring the respect for gender equality throughout the law-making process. Does it effectively enhance gender equality in the legislation or is it a mere reputational tool? To answer this question, after having introduced the illiberal features of the current Turkish regime, the activity of the Committee is assessed against the European and Turkish standards on the quality of legislation. Finally, concluding remarks compare the Turkish case with other illiberal authoritarianisms' discourse on gender equality, underscoring to what extent the Turkish authoritarian drift entails an anti-gender evolution in line with the conservative ideological vision of several other populisms.

Improvements in diversity are more pronounced in firms with a corporate culture that is already sympathetic to gender equality. When public attention to gender equality increases, firms reach out to a larger pool of women, such as women without industry experience or outside their network, but female director appointments do not appear to be dilutive of the board's skills. Instead, we observe less reliance on connections for director appointments and a decrease in the propensity to appoint connected men.

AB More often than not gender equality policies are good on paper but fall foul of politicized implementation processes. The reasons behind this are becoming a key area of investigation for feminist scholarship on the implementation of gender policies. This article analyzes the barriers to implementing gender equality policies in a corporatist regime. Focusing on the 2007 nurses' industrial action in Finland, the article considers the case of "Nancy the Nurse," which aimed at negotiating higher wages for nurses. Our findings suggest that the corporatist regime effectively prevented the implementation of gender equality policy, thus upholding the status quo and maintaining current wage relativities.

For that reason, the exploration and analysis of Indonesian vocabulary in the literature and in oral communication activities are conducted. Based on data analysis, gender inequality is represented in Indonesian vocabulary in the form of (1) marginalization dignity of woman compared to man, (2) subordination of woman to a man, and (3) woman as professional marker.

We pooled Demographic and Health Surveys data from eight African countries and used multilevel logistic regression on two maternal health outcomes (low body mass index and facility delivery) and two child health outcomes (immunization status and treatment for an acute respiratory infection). We found protective associations between the gender equality measures and the outcomes studied, indicating that gender equality is a potential strategy to improve maternal and child health in Africa.

TI Does National Gender Equality Matter? Gender Difference in the
   Relationship between Entrepreneurial Human Capital and Entrepreneurial
   Intention
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Gender equality contributes to economic growth and social progress by promoting women's social and economic participation. The national gender equality level can affect women's education and opportunities for economic participation. In this work, we examine whether entrepreneurial human capital (entrepreneurial education and experience) affects entrepreneurial intention and whether these relationships depend on gender and a country's gender equality level. We used Global Entrepreneurship Trend Report (GETR) data provided by the Korean Entrepreneurship Foundation. The global survey was conducted by the Korean National Statistical Office in 2016. The data were collected from 20 countries, including Korea, and contain at least 2000 individual responses from each country. We used HLM analysis with the HLM 6.0 program to examine the hypotheses. Our results show that entrepreneurship education increases entrepreneurial intention, and that the relationship is stronger among women than men. We also found that for women, the positive relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention is stronger in countries with lower gender equality. As for prior entrepreneurial experience, neither gender nor national gender equality level moderated the relationship between experience and entrepreneurial intention. This study contributes to the extension of entrepreneurship theory, especially in the area of women entrepreneurship. We confirm that entrepreneurial human capital contributes to entrepreneurial intention, and that gender and national gender equality level comprise an important social context that influences the effects of education and experience on the entrepreneurial intention of women.

TI Strategies of right populists in opposing gender equality in a polarized
   European Parliament
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB An increasingly polarized European Parliament (EP) has become an important site of radical right populist opposition to gender equality. Through a qualitative analysis of populist interventions in EP plenary debates on gender equality in the 8(th) legislature (2014-2019), this article identifies the discursive strategies adopted by right populists to oppose gender equality. It contributes to scholarly debates on populisms and on gender and politics by respectively suggesting to the former the need to dedicate attention to gender equality as a central aspect in populist ideologies, and to the latter the importance of considering a variety of strategies of radical right opposition to gender equality. Radical right populist strategies include not only indirect but also direct opposition to gender equality and draw on old and traditional gender imaginaries packaged in novel populist ways.

TI Do attitudes toward gender equality really differ between Norway and
   Sweden?
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
AB Using survey data from Norway and Sweden, we assess people's attitudes toward gender equality. Previous studies argue that these attitudes are more egalitarian in Sweden than in Norway. Similar to previous research, we find that Swedes are more positive towards gender equality in general. However, we find no differences regarding views on egalitarian sharing of household responsibilities, and Norwegians are actually more supportive of government intervention to increase gender equality. This suggests that the lower support for gender equality in Norway is not as clear-cut as previously thought and that active state intervention to improve gender equality may be even more feasible in Norway than in Sweden.

TI How Many and Which Women Own Land in India? Inter-gender and
   Intra-gender Gaps
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Measuring gender inequality in land ownership is essential for assessing progress in women's economic empowerment, tracing the impact of progressive laws on actual practice, and monitoring SDG 5 on gender equality. To effectively assess inter-gender (male-female) gaps in land ownership, however, requires multiple measures. We also need to know which women are more likely to own land by tracing intra-gender differences. To date, no study on India has provided a full range of measures on inter-gender inequality in land ownership or focused on intra-gender variations. This paper uses unique longitudinal data to measure inter-gender gaps in agricultural land ownership through multiple indicators, and changes over 2009-2014 across nine states. It also analyses intra-gender gaps, and identifies the factors-individual, household and regional-affecting a woman's likelihood of owning land. Despite significant advancement towards equality in inheritance laws, women are found to constitute barely 14% of landowners owning 11% of agricultural land in rural landowning households, averaged across states. Moreover, women are significantly more likely to inherit land as widows than as daughters, highlighting the divergence between the legal strengthening of daughters' rights and the social legitimacy that widows' claims continue to enjoy over daughters' claims.

TI Opening the Attitudinal Black Box: Three Dimensions of Latin American
   Elites' Attitudes about Gender Equality
SO POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB This paper takes one of the first, direct approaches to understanding which factors shape which attitudes towards gender equality among political elites. We examine support for gender equality among legislators in 13 Latin American countries, using 10 new questions from the 2015-2018 wave of the Latin American elites survey (PELA). We argue that legislators' attitudes about gender equality fall into three distinct dimensions: holding egalitarian views, recognizing that gender inequality is a problem, and supporting state action to hasten gender equality. Overall, women express the more gender-equal orientation on all three dimensions, while factors like religiosity and ideology matter differently for different dimensions. These findings demonstrate the need for more nuance in measuring and analyzing attitudes towards gender equality, in order to better understand the link between descriptive and substantive representation.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER
AB This article addresses the establishment of gender-equality norms in a case often presented as one of the most gender-equal legislatures in the world, namely, the Swedish Parliament (Riksdagen). Based on a series of in-depth interviews between 2005 and 2016 with 90 legislators in the Swedish Parliament, we ask whether there is agreement over gender-equality problems in Parliament that cut across gender and party affiliation, and whether there is convergence over time in this regard. Our findings show that there is a trend of convergence of the gender-inequality framings over time, which indicates the establishment of a shared legislative gender-equality norm. We suggest that a legislative gender-equality norm might work as a catalyst for progressive and continuous work in this area.

AB This article examines the cross-national relationship between a divorce culture on a national level and gender equality in intact marriages. Based on multilevel analysis of data from 22 countries in the International Social Survey Programme, the results indicate that a divorce culture on the national level is associated with greater marital equality In other words, in countries where divorce is accepted and practiced, the distribution of work between women and men in marriage is more equal. These findings support the enhanced equality hypothesis that the possibility of divorce provides women with leverage to gain more equal status within marriage.

AB Gender equality as one of the main values of the European Union still has not been totally reached in none of the European Union countries. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) announced the Gender Equality Index for the year of 2012 for the EU 28 countries, which was only 52.9 out of 100. Persisting inequality between women and men deepens the social economic inequality of the society and serves for the development of such negative trends as persisting pay gap and society polarization, which lead to diminishing middle class and growing gap between the rich and the poor. Due to prevailing stereotypes of gender roles, the group of women is constantly facing bigger social economic challenges caused by, firstly, stereotypical choice of education/profession, secondly, vertical and horizontal segregation of labor market and thirdly, less income, which in the long term forms less old age pensions for women. This research aims to analyze what is the influence of gender inequality to society's social economic inequality and to explore the different positions of women and men in the fields of income, material deprivation, vulnerability and resilience as well as to suggest recommendations for the reduction of gender inequality as inseparable part of social economic inequality and for the effective use of women's labor force as one of the hidden potentials for economic growth. The background of this research is theoretical framework and empirical evidence based on a sociological survey methodology (questionnaire). It is found that position of Lithuanian women is worse than men and requires special measures to be taken in the fields of income, material deprivation, vulnerability reduction and other spheres.

AB The present study examines intimate partner violence (IPV) reported by a sample of women in Zimbabwe to explore factors associated with the problem. Findings from the study indicate an important role of gender relationships in violence against women. The effects of gender inequalities on the likelihood of IPV vary with types of violence, but husband's patriarchal behaviors increase the likelihood of all forms of violence. The study suggests the importance of improving gender equality through public education on gender relationships, increasing women's education and economic opportunities, and eliminating customary laws that sustain gender inequality as necessary steps to combat IPV against women in Zimbabwe.

TI Policies of Gender Equality in Ethiopia: The Transformative Perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB This article addresses the question of why does an African country that had more women queens and empresses throughout its history practically than any other African country have the oldest known women queens in Africa, and purports to be committed to gender equality end up undermining its own objectives. The article shows that the focus on integrationist paradigm, an approach which focuses on the participation of women in the existing development paradigm, undermined the transformative nature of gender policy because it does not conceptualize gender parity as an end by itself, but as an instrument for economic progress. Consequently, progress towards gender parity remains to be little-by-little despite the strong political commitment to gender equality. The article concludes that the transformative nature of gender policy has been endangered by emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, macro-level conceptualization of gender issues, and the limited role of civil society in influencing policy decisions.

TI GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN ACTION? THE SCOTTISH STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT
   FUNDING PROGRAM 2014-2020
SO FEMINISMO-S
AB Since its inception, the European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of the promotion of gender equality. A key feature of the EUs approach to gender equality was the development and promotion of Gender Mainstreaming (GM) as an innovative approach to achieving gender equality. GM has been used as an approach to integrate gender into programme formulation, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation across the EU policy programmes, including the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), which plays a key role for both the inclusion and promotion of the contributions of women in economic development.
   GM is a well-researched gender equality strategy, however there is little consensus on its effectiveness and its ability to transform the policy paradigm and attempts to operationalise GM have been limited. Despite a large body of academic literature, there is limited recent research which links GM and the ESIF, specifically at a local level. Therefore, this article aims to do that by considering whether GM as part of regional development policy can be utilised as a tool for delivering transformative changes. Scotland's approach to GM within the ESIF is analysed utilising process tracing and semi-structured interviews with ESIF stakeholders in Scotland. Key findings are outlined for the 2014-2020 funding period at the national and project level.

TI The Relation Between Gender Egalitarian Values and Gender Differences in
   Academic Achievement
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Gender differences in achievement exhibit variation between domains and between countries. Much prior research has examined whether this variation could be due to variation in gender equality in opportunities, with mixed results. Here we focus instead on the role of a society's values about gender equality, which may have a more pervasive influence. We pooled all available country measures on adolescent boys' and girls' academic achievement between 2000 and 2015 from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessments of math, science, and reading. We then analyzed the relation between gender differences and country levels of gender egalitarian values, controlling for country levels of living standards and indicators of gender equality in opportunities. Gender egalitarian values came out as the most important predictor. Specifically, more gender egalitarian values were associated with improved performance of boys relative to girls in the same countries. This pattern held in reading, where boys globally perform substantially worse than girls, as well as in math and science where gender differences in performance are small and may favor either boys or girls. Our findings suggest a previously underappreciated role of cultural values in moderating gender gaps in academic achievement.

SO JOURNAL OF SEXUAL AGGRESSION
AB Sextortion as a severe form of sexual harassment, has always constituted a persistent social phenomenon that undermines gender equality in different societies. However, sextortion remains an under-researched field in many countries, especially in the non-Western world. Informed by feminist theories, this study analysed the causes and consequences of sextortion in Rwanda. A mixed-methods design was applied with qualitative data being collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with 150 respondents. Data analysis was inspired by a qualitative approach of thematic analysis. Emergent themes from the interviews were identified and coded using NVivo software, while SPSS software was useful to generate descriptive statistics in order to characterise the data set based on its properties. Key findings include the dearth of reporting cases of sextortion and its laws; persistence of patriarchal system; gender income inequality and an increase in the unemployment rate as the main causes of sextortion. The decline of victims' economic status; psychological and health problems; an increase of gender inequality and domestic violence; a decrease of productivity and credibility; and deterioration of various human rights were among the main consequences of this phenomenon. These findings bear significant practical implications including the fact that sextortion may undermine efforts to end gender inequality.

TI Gender and Leadership in Spain: a Systematic Review of Some Key Aspects
SO SEX ROLES
AB As Spain experienced rapid societal and gender equality changes after the end of the dictatorship in 1975, the development of gender equality in Spain has differed from other European countries and the United States. Therefore, the results of Spanish studies conducted on gender and leadership might differ from those conducted in countries with other historical backgrounds such as other European countries or the United States. We systematically reviewed the current theoretical and empirical literature on gender and leadership with a special emphasis on this comparison. Thereby, we focused on four essential aspects: (a) the underlying mechanism of gender inequality (e.g., traditional gender roles), (b) gender and leadership behavior, (c) the relation of female representation in top management and on boards with organizational performance, and d) female representation and non-performance-related organizational outcomes. Further, Spain is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis. On the one hand, such a crisis might provide a chance for gender equality development; on the other hand, it might trigger a regression toward traditional gender roles in society. Thus, in our discussion, we relate the results of our comparison to these two different but possible consequences of the crisis. To conclude, we outline directions for future research that we hope will provide answers to important questions in this area of research.

TI Telescoping the origins of obesity to women's bodies: How gender
   inequalities are being squeezed out of Barker's hypothesis
SO ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
AB Aim: This paper traces the genealogy of the Barker hypothesis and its intersections with popular representations of scientific discourses about pregnancy and maternal obesity.
   Method: Drawing on Foucault's genealogical method, this study examines the historical 'descent' of the developmental origins of adult disease and its initial grounding in structural factors of gender inequality and low socioeconomic status.
   Results: In the more recent reproductive medicine literature, Barker's hypothesis has been used to understand the causes and consequences of foetal over-nutrition and has shifted its focus from social determinants to individual, gendered bodies. The print media has gainfully employed this conceptualization of obesity and, in doing so, placed women, and mothers in particular, as causal agents in the reproduction of obesity across generations. Such a 'common sense' understanding of obesity production and reproduction means that both the scientific literature and the public understanding of science has inadvertently assisted in putting women forward as the transmitters of obesity across generations.
   Conclusions: This powerful telescoping of the origins of obesity to women's bodies and their appetites is in stark contrast to earlier foci on gender inequalities and changing women's circumstances.

TI The persistence of gender inequality. Gender as an attributional
   category
SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
AB Although gender inequality has been widely discussed in recent years, there is still a lack of powerful explanations for its persistence. The article contributes to that debate by arguing that 'gender' is an attributional category. Organisations, informal relationships and gender politics are each governed by specific rules which direct gender attributions. To the scholar, gender may look like a comprehensive, universal category of social action. However, modem contexts of action do by no means always resort to the category of gender, but are very selective and inconsistent in attributing the reasons for social inequality to gender. This hypothesis does not downplay the importance of gender inequality. On the contrary, it shows that the context-specific, situational control of gender attributions constitutes the main reason for the persistence of gender inequality, because it often prevents social actors from regarding social subordination as gender inequality.

TI Public support for gender equality in athletics programs
SO WOMEN & POLITICS
AB Considerable public resistance remains to gender equality in domains that are physically demanding and carry substantial risk of bodily harm-a description that fits competitive athletics. Analysis of data from national opinion surveys indicates, however, that since the mid-1970s most Americans have favored not only gender-equal access to participation in interscholastic and intercollegiate sports, but also gender-equal funding of athletics programs (a far more radical approach than policymakers or activists have seriously considered). Unlike studies of the determinants of support for other aspects of gender equality, levels of education registered no significant impact on these attitudes; what did matter were gender and age, with women and younger people being more supportive.

SO EURASIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB This study sought to identify the metaphorical languages employed by Indonesian female ulama to realize and promote linguistic gender equality. In this qualitative study, four Indonesian female ulama actively preaching in women's organizations participated. The data for this study consisted of the female ulama's figurative expressions of gender equality. The information was gathered via recording the ulama's sermons. Pragglejaz Group identified metaphorical statements expressing gender equality by altering Metaphor Identification Procedures (MIP). The study of data suggests that similes, new metaphors, and conceptual metaphors facilitate gender equality. In similes and novel metaphors, the balance between males and females is structured through colloquial.(c) 2022 EJAL & the Authors. Published by Eurasian Journal of Applied Linguistics (EJAL).

TI Citizen support for the pursuit of gender equality in US foreign policy
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AB We ask two questions in this article: First, what is the level of public support for the pursuit of gender equality in foreign policy? Second, what are the most significant correlates of that support? We report the results of the first national opinion survey that queried citizens about their support for policies to increase global gender equality. We find that an average of 60 to 90 percent approve of pursuing gender equality and specific programmatic initiatives. Americans also strongly agree with one rationale for pursuing global gender equality: 65 percent agree that "The world would be a more peaceful place if more women were involved in making decisions." Second, we find that a number of individual characteristics and personal values are strongly correlated with support for gender initiatives. Our results also suggest that women's greater endorsement of universalism values explains their higher levels of support for global gender equality.

TI Gender equality legislation in Korea
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
AB Korea has revised the discriminative contents in its existing laws and has introduced other legislative changes to ensure gender equality since the 1980s and has succeeded in establishing various gender equality legislations in a relative short period. Despite various legislative measures, Korean women's status shows that we still have a long way to achieve gender equality. This implies that concrete public policies and legislations are required to allow legal equality to play a critical role to influence Korean men and women and to change the social system substantially.
   The report discusses gender mainstreaming and how it has adapted women related legislations as a way to overcome the limitations of existing Korean law and policies.
   Gender mainstreaming in public policies can invoke reorganization of existing policies. As the establishing, executing and evaluating processes of policies are reformed, reorganized and improved, gender segregated jobs and roles of men and women should become redundant. Through such changes various public service programs should also be accompanied to make work places become family-friendly and reorganize the gender roles of men and women.

TI Gender justice, law and religion in Zimbabwe: An evaluation of the role
   of sacred texts
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB Gender equality is something that the human race has been struggling with since time immemorial. No country has achieved gender equality despite the legislative, social, and economic gains for women. Therefore, modern society likes to blame certain groups, such as religion for the gender inequalities which are faced, more than others. The main focus of this study is to evaluate the role of religious leaders in promoting gender equality through the legislation and religious texts in Zimbabwe. The study further explores how certain religious norms and practices can be modified through religious texts to accommodate women in achieving gender equality. The paper acknowledges that religious leaders have a greater responsibility to standup, speak and act with and on behalf of those with less power, such as the marginalized and discriminated against, including exploited planet Earth. The paper seeks to foreground how certain traditional religious practices and norms have exacerbated gender inequality in Zimbabwe, despite the laws that have been enacted by the government of Zimbabwe to promote gender equality. The data for the paper was gathered through observations and semi-structured interviews conducted with both religious leaders and women to establish how religious norms and practices directly or indirectly affect women and how they can be modified to achieve gender equality in Zimbabwe. The data gathered was analysed through descriptive data analysis. The paper concludes by recommending that religious leaders should be thoroughly trained on how to promote gender equality through religious texts and legislation. Contribution: The article evaluated the role of religious leaders in promoting gender equality through legislation and religious texts in Zimbabwe. It argued that religious leaders have a higher need to support, advocate and act on behalf of individuals who are marginalised and subjected to discrimination on planet Earth. Hence, its contribution was in promoting gender equality through religious texts and legislation in Zimbabwe for sustainable development.

TI The roots of female emancipation: Initializing role of Cool Water
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB The Cool Water condition is a climatic configuration that combines periodically frosty winters with mildly warm summers under the ubiquitous accessibility of fresh water. Historically, it embodied opportunity endowments that weakened fertility pressures, resulting in household formation patterns that empowered women and reduced gender inequality. Reviewing the literature on the deep historic roots of gender inequality, this paper theorizes and provides evidence for a trajectory that (1) originates in the Cool Water climatic configuration, (2) leads to late female marriages in preindustrial times, and (3) eventually paves the way for various gender-egalitarian patterns of the present.

CL New Coll, Oxford, ENGLAND
HO New Coll
AB International consensus on education priorities accords an important place to achieving gender justice in the educational sphere. Both the Dakar 'Education for All' goals and the Millennium Development goals emphasise two goals, in this regard. These two goals are distinguished as gender parity goals [achieving equal participation of girls and boys in all forms of education based on their proportion in the relevant age-groups in the population] and gender equality; goals [ensuring educational equality between boys and girls]. In turn these have been characterised as quantitative/numerical and qualitative goals respectively. In order to consider progress towards both types of goal, both quantitative and qualitative assessments need to be made of the nature of progress towards gender equality. Achieving gender parity is just one step towards gender equality in and through education. An education system with equal numbers of boys and girls participating, who may progress evenly through the system, may not in fact be based on gender equality. Following Wilson (Human Rights: Promoting gender equality in and through education. Background paper for EFA GMR 2003/4, 2003) a consideration of gender equality in education therefore needs to be understood as the right to education [access and participation], as well as rights within education [gender-aware educational environments, processes, and outcomes], and rights through education [meaningful education outcomes that link education equality with wider processes of gender justice].

TI Inclusive Finance, Gender Inequality, and Sustainable Economic Growth in
   Africa
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB This study examined the effect of multidimensional inclusive finance index and other financial indicators on gender inequality in 41 countries in Africa from 2000 to 2020 using the two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression (2SLS-IV). Through conditional and unconditional effects, the study established the thresholds and net effect from the interaction between inclusive finance and gender inequality indicators on gross national income per capita (GNI per capita). The thresholds provide the critical masses at which gender inequality level wipes out the positive effect of financial inclusion on the economy. The study showed that the thresholds for gender inequality indicators (CPIA gender inequality, secondary gross enrollment disparity, and tertiary education gross enrollment disparity) are 0.353, 0.098, and 0.091, respectively, for financial inclusion to yield a positive net effect on economic growth in Africa. Based on the critical roles of financial access in the socioeconomic development of African countries, policymakers and international development partners must design policies directed at reducing financial sector participation cost, improving financial intermediation efficiency, and reducing collateral constraints. These policies should not be designed and tailored toward just the rich and privileged few but targeted at women in rural Africa and low- and vulnerable-income groups to achieve inclusive finance for inclusive growth and shared prosperity. State policies and efforts to create equal opportunities for all genders must be fast-tracked.

TI Country-level gender inequality is associated with structural
   differences in the brains of women and men
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Gender inequality across the world has been associated with a higher risk to mental health problems and lower academic achievement in women compared to men. We also know that the brain is shaped by nurturing and adverse socio-environmental experiences. Therefore, unequal exposure to harsher conditions for women compared to men in gender-unequal countries might be reflected in differences in their brain structure, and this could be the neural mechanism partly explaining women's worse outcomes in gender-unequal countries. We examined this through a random-effects meta-analysis on cortical thickness and surface area differences between adult healthy men and women, including a meta-regression in which country-level gender inequality acted as an explanatory variable for the observed differences. A total of 139 samples from 29 different countries, totaling 7,876 MRI scans, were included. Thickness of the right hemisphere, and particularly the right caudal anterior cingulate, right medial orbitofrontal, and left lateral occipital cortex, presented no differences or even thicker regional cortices in women compared to men in gender-equal countries, reversing to thinner cortices in countries with greater gender inequality. These results point to the potentially hazardous effect of gender inequality on women's brains and provide initial evidence for neuroscience-informed policies for gender equality.

TI The profile of gender equality issue attention in Western Europe
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH
AB This article investigates the factors that drive governments to pay attention to gender equality issues and place them upon executive agendas. In line with studies of the dynamics of issue attention, which demonstrate the importance of investigating variability in the attention policy makers give to issue demands across policy domains, this article argues that policy issues related to gender equality are multidimensional and patterns in executive attention vary across the different types of gender issues. Multidimensionality of gender equality issues reflects different dynamics in agenda-setting as different issues invoke contrasting constellations of political representation, institutional friction and veto points. To investigate this variation, this article proposes a twofold distinction between class-based and status-based gender equality issues and assesses the validity of three sets of explanations for when gender issues succeed in reaching executive agendas: women in politics, party ideology and economic performance. Drawing on governmental attention datasets from the Comparative Agendas Project, a systematic comparative quantitative analysis of the determinants of gender equality issue attention in five Western European countries is conducted. The main findings confirm that the mechanisms through which different types of gender equality issues gain executive attention differ according to the kind of the gender equality demand. Costly class-based gender equality issues are more likely to receive executive attention when the economy is performing well, when there is a strong presence of Social Democrats and when there is a high proportion of female MPs. In contrast, economic performance, party politics and women's parliamentary presence do not seem to exert any impact on status-based issues. Instead, critical actors in the government seem to be the strongest driver for attention over this second type of gender equality issue. This study contributes a gendered dimension to the policy agendas scholarship, adding theoretical and empirical depth to the understanding of how non-core issues secure their place on full governmental agendas. By focusing on how to secure governmental attention for gender equality issues, the article makes a major contribution to understanding the initial genesis of gender equality policies.

By privileging the boys' own voices, the study examines how the boys' sense of solidarity toward others, derived from the citizenship duties and collegiality emphasised in non-governmental workshops, impacted their commitment to gender equality. Research implications include the importance of educating young males on females' rights and listening to the boys' views on the resulting progress and remaining challenges regarding the attainment of sustainable gender equality in social spheres and public policies.

TI Women in the neighbourhood: Reinstating the European Union's civilising
   mission on the back of gender equality promotion?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB The European Union has launched its New European Neighbourhood Policy as a reaction to a changing neighbourhood'. A key novelty in the New European Neighbourhood Policy is the special role attributed to gender equality promotion as an important ingredient of Europeanisation. The literature has so far focused on assessing whether and to what extent neighbourhood countries adopt and implement European Union gender equality norms. Bringing together the feminist and postcolonial literature on gender equality promotion and European identity formation, this article resituates the New European Neighbourhood Policy within the broader debate regarding processes of European identity formation and Europe's relations with Others. We combine the concept of delineating gendered and racialised coding with the concept of contrapuntal reading to analyse key official European Union documents alongside the voices expressing themselves through new (social) media. This allows us to highlight silences and exclusions within New European Neighbourhood Policy narratives, to resituate these narratives in their historical context, and to render visible the diversity of competing and interrelated narratives related to gender equality promotion. We read the recent focus on gender equality promotion in the New European Neighbourhood Policy as an expression of the ambivalence of European Union identity building: at a moment when neighbouring countries move closer to Europe, either adopting the acquis communautaire or going through democratisation processes, they are placed at a spatial and temporal distance outside Europe. Our analysis highlights the persistence of colonial practices of Othering and hierarchical Self-Other definitions that are reproduced through current New European Neighbourhood Policy policies. Yet, we suggest that this moment might also present an opportunity to render visible and take seriously the co-constitutive relationship between the European Union and its Others, which could point to alternative forms of interaction and identity building.

TI "Cruel optimism" in the universities: A discursive-deconstructive
   reading of promising promotional projects of gender equality
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB The article illuminates how gender inequality in Ireland's higher education sector continues to be constituted at policy and at local institutional levels as a problem that requires 'fixing the women". It analyses two gender equality projects' discursive materials targeting female academics in Irish universities, showing that while these projects embrace elements of feminist praxis and critique, they ultimately propagate "cruel optimism". They do this by exhorting women academics' subjectification to burdensome practices of strategizing, self-auditing and self-promotion, lured by the promise of awards that only a few will attain. Presented are two cases of what we call "promising promotional projects" that we have encountered in our work in our university. We use the term "projects" to refer to time-limited, bounded interventions that respond to "gender equality" as a field of government, where problems have been diagnosed and where practicable and pragmatic solutions are seen to be required. Our discursive-deconstructive reading of these projects' discursive materials highlights how gender equality projects target women for "promotion" through mobilizing gendered technologies of the self.

TI A State-Level Analysis of Gender Inequality on Male and Female Homicide
SO CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB Inequalities have received a fair amount of study from criminologists interested in homicide and crime. The vast majority of the examinations exploring the relationship between inequality and homicide and crime have examined income inequality. Nonetheless, feminist theorists have stated that gender inequality may be predictive of all violence, not just female victimization. The UNDP gender inequality index was replicated for states in the United States and applied to overall, male, and female homicide rates. The findings demonstrate that increased gender inequality is predictive of increased overall, male, and female homicide. These findings illustrate that gender inequality is predictive of overall, male, and female homicide victimization.

TI Can Tourism Development Reduce Gender Inequality?
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB This study evaluates the nonlinear relationship between gender inequality and tourism receipts using a standard quantile regression approach and advances the results with an asymmetric application. Gender inequality is a pervasive and complex phenomenon rooted in the socio-economic culture of many countries. The reasons for inequality have country-specific situations, and to gain a broader understanding, countries were grouped by their income levels to explore the relationships for different groups. The study concludes that not all countries stimulate overall gender inequality through tourism. The study results show that in all but the 10th quantile, tourism had a negative and significant relationship with gender inequality providing support for the notion that tourism helps narrow the gender gap. The exceptions were found only at the 10th quantile indicates that low-income countries with low levels of tourism development could not derive the benefits of tourism's potential in reducing gender inequality.

TI The Discursive Resistance of Men to Gender-equality Interventions:
   Negotiating "Unjustness" and "Unnecessity" in Swedish Forestry
SO MEN AND MASCULINITIES
AB This article adds to the understanding of men's discursive resistance in relation to gender-equality interventions at work. Using Swedish men forestry professionals as the empirical base, the result shows how discursive resistance were performative acts, part of the construction of the same gender-equality interventions and organizational contexts that they were perceived to describe. In this case, direct opposition to gender equality provided a limited discursive position and sets of logics available in practice. Instead, the possibilities to renegotiate gender-equality interventions as unjust and unnecessary required, we conclude that the industry's ambition to hire and promote more women was perceived to have led to the use of affirmative action and the disruption of meritocratic principles and that the problems of gender equality were placed in the traditional forestry and among "prejudiced old men," as oppose to the more "modern" and "women friendly" forestry of today.

TI The Impact of Regional International Parliaments on Governments' Policy
   Frameworks for Gender Equality
SO POLITICS & GENDER
AB Countries around the world adopt different types of gender equality principles in government action plans, and these principles play a critical role in determining public policies regarding gender issues. International actors may prod countries in this direction; these actors include regional international parliaments. However, the power of regional international parliaments varies, allowing us to investigate the extent to which they have an impact on national governments' adoption of policy frameworks for gender equality. This study analyzes the impact of regional international parliaments on governments' gender equality policy frameworks. A three-dimension scale was developed to measure the degree to which governments have developed policy frameworks for gender equality. In multivariate modeling using a broad range of control variables, the study finds that the strength of regional international parliaments has a robust impact on governments' policy frameworks for gender equality.

TI Power, knowledge and politics: Exploring the contested terrain of
   girl-focused interventions at the national launch of the United Nations
   Girls' Education Initiative in The Gambia
SO THEORY AND RESEARCH IN EDUCATION
AB Gender equality in education has become a highly embedded norm in global development policy, as well as within the poverty reduction and national development policies of aid recipient countries. Despite such progress, however, we know little about the significance of competing gender equality and education policy orientations (e.g., human capital, human rights, human capabilities), especially in relation to the power and political dynamics at work in the enactment of global gender equality in education policies in national policy spaces. This article addresses these gaps in the literature through a qualitative examination of girls' education policy in The Gambia, a country widely hailed as a leader in the promotion of gender equality in education. I use an analysis of the produced knowledge of World Bank and government documents alongside the findings from an ethnographic account of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) national launch workshop in The Gambia to illustrate my central claim that girls' education policy, on the ground, is more complex and contested than is suggested in the produced knowledge of donor and government documents. Moreover, my account of the UNGEI launch workshop serves to highlight some of the challenges and tensions associated with the global-national interface of efforts to promote gender equality in education.

TI Gender Really Matters in Group Work: A Visibilization and Politicization

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB Analyzing gender inequalities when teaching political science can be an opportunity. Making inequalities visible in the classroom using students' personal experiences can help teachers generate coresponsible practices which are necessary in a context where group work is increasingly important. Moreover, revealing gender inequalities through the students' daily work can help them to understand a key element of the discipline: that politics needs to go beyond private views of social problems, in order to reach collective solutions. In this article, starting with five discussion groups, we give students a voice, to reveal how female students in the classroom take on private and reproductive roles that increase the work they do and affect the evaluation they receive. We have used this diagnosis to design a teaching sequence, implemented in 4 groups between 2018 and 2022, that aims to make gender inequalities visible in work relationships between peers as a first step toward students interpreting and managing these relationships politically.

SO AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH
AB Gender-based violence continues to be a leading determinant of South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic. As such, gender socialisation and de-normalisation of gender inequality and violence remain principal objectives for public health organisations. This article discusses youth reception of a mass media HIV/AIDS prevention campaign targeting gender inequality. Applying social cognitive theory to the analysis of focus group data highlights three interrelated challenges to encouraging positive self-efficacy in gender-based violence and HIV prevention: (1) HIV/ AIDS-related media saturation; (2) AIDS messaging fatigue; and (3) challenges reconciling popular youth culture with gender equity messaging. The article recommends public health and social justice organisations consider a flexible approach to the ideological or behavioural congruence of potential celebrity ambassadors and/or media to maximise youth appeal and reduce messaging fatigue.

TI Sex differences in personality are larger in gender equal countries:
   Replicating and extending a surprising finding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB Sex differences in personality have been shown to be larger in more gender equal countries. We advance this research by using an extensive personality measure, the IPIP-NEO-120, with large country samples (N > 1000), from 22 countries. Furthermore, to capture the multidimensionality of personality we measure sex differences with a multivariate effect size (Mahalanobis distance D). Results indicate that past research, using univariate measures of effect size, have underestimated the size of between-country sex differences in personality. Confirming past research, there was a strong correlation (r = .69) between a country's sex differences in personality and their Gender Equality Index. Additional analyses showed that women typically score higher than men on all five trait factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), and that these relative differences are larger in more gender equal countries. We speculate that as gender equality increases both men and women gravitate towards their traditional gender roles.

We explore trends in women's workforce participation, union membership, economic security and pay equity, as well as major changes pertaining to work-family policy settings, workplace sexual harassment, and family and domestic violence leave. We conclude that although policy and employment frameworks have created a foundation on which to build gender equality, policy development has been sporadic and the context for women in Australian workplaces remains far from equal.

TI Gender Equality from Beneath: Electoral Gender Quotas in Poland
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIETY
AB This article explores the introduction of electoral gender quotas and the unprecedented social mobilization in pursuit of gender equality in Poland. The quota law was adopted as a citizens' initiative organized by the Congress of Women, a new women's movement. The article analyzes the factors that account for the success of this initiative, which permanently changed the public debate on gender rights in Poland. In contrast to other countries with legislative gender quotas, the Polish law was the result of bottom-up processes, and it has a strong democratic legitimacy. The law has not significantly influenced the representation of women in the Parliament, yet it significantly mainstreamed the gender perspective in the public debate. Nonetheless, the way in which the quota law has been applied by political parties shows that Polish women in politics are a "minority" devoid of power, and that the prospects for a parity democracy are still remote.

TI ENTERPRISING WOMEN A Comparison of Women's and Men's Small Business
   Networks
SO GENDER & SOCIETY
AB This study demonstrates the importance of social context to the study of networks vital to business success. Results from analyses of the personal and business characteristics associated with different types of networks, a topic that has been neglected in past research, show the importance of structural perspectives emphasizing that women and men in the same situations have similar networks. Yet there are some network differences even among these women and men who operate the same kinds of businesses. This suggests that insights from gender construction perspectives should be integrated into network and other gender inequality studies.

TI Is gender inequality an essential driver in explaining environmental

   Union countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB The effect of gender inequality on environmental degradation was examined for panel data of fourteen countries from the European Union (EU) from 1991 to 2016. The Quantile via Moments (QvM) and Fixed effects models were used to perform the empirical investigation. The results from the QvM and the Fixed effects models support that the gender gap pay and energy consumption increase the CO2 emissions in the EU. However, the economic growth, globalisation and urbanisation deepening do not increase the environmental problem. This empirical investigation will contribute to the literature, policymakers, and governments. It will help develop more initiatives to reduces gender inequality at the same time it mitigates the environmental degradation in the EU countries. Finally, the empirical finds of this investigation will open a new topic of investigation in the literature about the relationship between environmental degradation and gender inequality.

TI Examining the Relationship between Tourism and Gender Equality: Evidence
   from Asia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study analyzes the relationship between tourism and gender equality using panel vector autoregression and vector error correction models estimated by the generalized method of moment. This methodology is based on panel data from 36 Asian countries between 2006 and 2019. The other three variables including the economy, employment, and education are also analyzed. The results show that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between tourism and gender equality. In the short run, tourism is not the Granger cause for gender equality; however, tourism significantly contributes to gender equality in all regions in the long run. Furthermore, a heterogeneous causality between tourism and gender equality is found across the regions. Tourism's positive effect on gender equality does not depend entirely on economic empowerment. All the economy, education and employment mostly contribute to realizing gender equality, but this contribution is not decisive. The findings and policy implications are finally discussed.

CA Gender Equality Norms Hlth
TI Disrupting gender norms in health systems: making the case for change
SO LANCET
AB Restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities are replicated and reinforced in health systems, contributing to gender inequalities in health. In this Series paper, we explore how to address all three through recognition and then with disruptive solutions. We used intersectional feminist theory to guide our systematic reviews, qualitative case studies based on lived experiences, and quantitative analyses based on cross- sectional and evaluation research. We found that health systems reinforce patients' traditional gender roles and neglect gender inequalities in health, health system models and clinic- based programmes are rarely gender responsive, and women have less authority as health workers than men and are often devalued and abused. With regard to potential for disruption, we found that gender equality policies are associated with greater representation of female physicians, which in turn is associated with better health outcomes, but that gender parity is insufficient to achieve gender equality. We found that institutional support and respect of nurses improves quality of care, and that women's empowerment collectives can increase health- care access and provider responsiveness. We see promise from social movements in supporting women's reproductive rights and policies. Our findings suggest we must view gender as a fundamental factor that predetermines and shapes health systems and outcomes. Without addressing the role of restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities within and outside health systems, we will not reach our collective ambitions of universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. We propose action to systematically identify and address restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities in health systems.

AB On the basis of European Social Survey, attitudes of migrants to gender equality are compared to local population in countries of West and North Europe and Russia. Secondary data analysis shows that migrants are rather more conservative than Europeans in their attitudes to women position in society. Also migrants' attitude to gender equality is linked to gender specifics of host society. Islam takes a position of its own, remaining stable, though not strong indicator of negative attitude to gender equality.

TI Gender Equality in Ecuadorian Public Service
SO CIENCIA UNEMI
AB When gender equality in Ecuador is discussed, it is important to relate inequality and exclusion, which are a hierarchical system of belonging. There is such a common reality in societies where gender equality is erroneously identified or the achievements in terms of women's rights are superficially studied, behind or decreased for many years by all the societies. Gender is not synonymous of women, feminism or sex, but it is strongly related with these terms, it is more complex that has to do with the constitutive element of social and power relations. Unfortunately, the problem is still in force and with a lot to discuss, some doctrinaire state that perhaps the solution is that men and women share, on equal terms of conditions and responsibilities, but this is not necessarily the tip of the iceberg. This paper provides a brief history of the participation of women in public service, emphasizing in recent years, in which gender equality in political and public life of Ecuadorian women emerges.

TI The Business Case of Gender Equality in Swedish Forestry and Mining -
   Restricting or Enabling Organizational Change
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Forestry and mining constitutes an important part of Swedish basic industry. These industries are heavily male-dominated and are expressing an ambition to become more gender equal and less gender-segregated, arguing that this could strengthen their competitiveness in a number of areas. In this article we explore how company representatives construct gender equality as a business case and discuss how these constructions restrict and/or enable gender equality in these organizations. Departing from a social constructivist understanding of how language (re)produces gendered power relations in the workplace, the empirical basis of this paper consists of eight interviews with respondents who possess special insights into, and being of strategic importance to, gender equality issues in forestry and mining companies. In our analysis we found three dominant dimensions of the business case of gender equality Marketing (as) gender equality, Uncovering the male norm and Gender equality as a depoliticized value. We conclude that the business case framing facilitates for the companies to engage in issues of gender equality. However, issues concerning conflicting interests and power relations seem to be difficult to address within the business case discourse. This we argue affects and shapes the terms for gender equality in these organizations.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH
AB Influenced by the Confucian culture, clan-family structure, and communist ideology, gender inequality still widely exists in modern China. On reflection of the socio-cultural framework that shaped the Chinese gender lens, this study took a "power to" perspective on women empowerment by investigating 28 Guimi-tourists' embodied experience. Upon identifying the core experience of "Return to Innocence," a resources-agency-achievements framework was constructed to depict the underlying mechanism through which Guimi tourism empowered women to counteract sociocultural constraints. The study offered a context-specific understanding of Guimi tourism and theoretically contributed to women empowerment and tourism, as well as Chinese cultural studies.

AB Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the attitudes of university students about gender equality.
   Method: Population of this descriptive research includes students that have stayed in Erzurum general directorate of higher education credit and hostels institution in 2010-2011 academic years. Research sample is made of 507 volunteer students that were chosen with nonprobability sampling method. "Descriptive Information Form" and "Gender Equality Scale" were used in order to gather data. In data evaluation process; average, standard deviation, percentage distributions, t-test in independent group and One Way Analysis of Variance were used.
   Results: Average age of the students that have attended the study was 21.64+/-1.93; % 60.9 of students was female while % 39.1 was male. % 46.7 of students was graduated from high schools while % 39.4 were studying in health sciences, % 19.1 social sciences,, % 29.4 educational sciences and % 12 in physical sciences departments. Differences between Gender Equality Scale's total point averages according to genders, high school programs from which students were graduated and departments at which they were studying were found to be statistically meaningful (p<0.005). Students' Gender Equality Scale "Traditional Gender Norms" sub-scale average was 36.91+/-6.46, "Equalitarian Gender Norms" sub-scale point average was 8.61+/-2.24, and total point average was 45.53+/-6.71.
   Conclusion: It was determined that students that have attended the study had "medium-level" positive gender equality attitude. It was determined that female students who were graduated from Super High School/Anatolian High School and who have been studying in health departments have more positive perceptions about gender equality.

TI When Civilians Are Attacked: Gender Equality and Terrorist Targeting
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB While scholars demonstrate a consistent negative relationship between gender equality and violence, the effect of women's rights on the quality of terrorism and the type of victims targeted remains unexplored. This article introduces a new model of terrorists' strategic targeting by examining the trade-off between the ease of a civilian-oriented attack and the negative public reaction these attacks invoke. Within this framework, gender equality increases the costs of civilian targeting by inducing public opinion costs. As gender equality increases, the costs of attacking civilians increase relatively more than government-oriented attacks. Using data on domestic terrorism between 1970 and 2007 and a subnational examination of a randomly implemented gender quota in India, this study demonstrates that as gender equality increases, the ratio of civilian-oriented to government-oriented attacks decreases. Overall, this study refines our understanding of terrorists' strategic targeting and identifies heterogeneity in the Women, Peace, and Security theory.

TI Change agents or defending the status quo? How senior leaders frame
   workplace gender equality
SO GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
AB Senior leaders are usually understood to be ideally positioned to drive the organizational changes needed to promote workplace gender equality. Yet seniority also influences leaders' values and attitudes, and how they interpret evidence of inequalities, determine organizational priorities, and design and implement remedies. This article examines leaders' perceptions of workplace gender equality using system justification theory to explain survey data from Australia's public sector (n = 2292). Multivariate analysis indicates that male and female leaders more positively rate the gender equality climate in their agencies, compared with lower-level staff, and that male leaders show most propensity to defend the status quo. Findings call into question the effectiveness of change strategies that rely on leadership and buy-in of those whose privilege is embedded in existing arrangements, and problematize dominant organizational approaches casting senior leaders as effective change agents for gender equality. The article helps to explain gendered power dynamics, which produce and sustain organizational inequalities and make workplace equality so hard to achieve, and points to ways to strengthen practical approaches to promote equality in organizations.

TI Does More Equality for Women Mean Less War? Rethinking Sex and Gender
   Inequality and Political Violence
SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
AB Recent world events, such as the rise of hypermasculine authoritarian leaders, have shown the importance of both sex and gender for understanding international politics. However, quantitative researchers of conflict have long relegated the study of sex and gender inequality as a cause of war to a specialized group of scholars, despite overwhelming evidence that the connections are profound and consequential. In this review essay, we demonstrate the tremendous progress made in this field by analyzing a wave of research that examines the relationships between sex and gender inequality and war. We divide this work into theories that emphasize strategy versus those that analyze structures. In addition, we focus on two aspects of this research agenda-specifying mechanisms that link sex and gender inequality to war, and leveraging data at multiple levels of analysis-to outline fruitful pathways forward for the broader international security research agenda. Ultimately, we argue that the study of the nexus of sex and gender inequality and war will enliven theoretical debates, illuminate new hypotheses, and enrich the policy discourse with robust evidence.

TI SEX COMPOSITION OF TWINS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND
   MATERNAL TREATMENT-SEEKING OUTCOMES IN RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Societal gender inequality and a preference for male children has been shown to be detrimental to girls' health. This is despite females' innate biological advantage early in life. The negative effects of gender inequity on female health are most pronounced in resource-poor countries, where cultural norms supporting a preference for male children are strongest. However, most of what is known about gender inequality and child health comes from studies of singleton births. There is little evidence for how, or if, the disadvantages associated with gender bias and son preference extend to multiple births, a population inherently at risk for a number of health challenges. This analysis examines whether gender bias in health outcomes exists for twins. Data on live twin births from 38 Demographic and Health Surveys were compiled (n=11,528 individuals) and twins were categorized as girl/girl, girl/boy, boy/girl or girl/girl. Gender inequality was measured via the Gender Inequality Index. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between twin sex composition, gender inequality and eight outcomes of infant and child morbidity, mortality and mother's treatment-seeking behaviours. Twin pairs containing girls had significantly lower odds of first-year mortality. Higher country-level gender inequality was associated with higher odds of reporting diarrhoea and fever/cough, as well as an increased odds of post-neonatal mortality. Results suggest that the biological advantage for females may be stronger than son preference and gender inequality in the first year of life. Understanding these relationships has the potential to inform efforts to curb the influence of gender preference on the health of female children in resource-poor settings.

TI Gender Inequalities in the Transition to College
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
AB Background: In terms of high school graduation, college entry, and persistence to earning a college degree, young women now consistently outperform their male peers. Yet most research on gender inequalities in education continues to focus on aspects of education where women trail men, such as women's under representation at top-tier institutions and in science and engineering programs. The paucity of research on the realms where women outpace men, namely college enrollment and completion, constitutes a major gap in the literature.
   Purpose: This article provides an overview of gender inequality in the transition to college and in college experiences by examining the ways that women are advantaged in higher education and the arenas where they still trail men. It also discusses theoretical perspectives useful in assessing the causes of gender inequality and then suggests how future research could advance our understanding of the complex nature of gender inequality in higher education.
   Research Design: The identification and critical review of research and theories that have been used or that could prove useful in assessing and explaining the complex patterns of gender inequalities in the transition to college and in higher education more generally.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Fruitful pathways for future research to advance understanding of the complex nature of gender inequalities in higher education include examining gender inequalities early in the educational life course, attending to gender differences within vulnerable segments of the population who may be particularly at risk for not attending higher education, and investigating how the structure and practices of schooling relate to gender differences in educational outcomes.

TI Gender equality for sustainability in ports: Developing a framework
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Ports have increasingly been addressing sustainability issues; however, gender equality has been a low priority in such efforts. This paper is aimed at providing insights into how ports have been addressing gender equality to contribute to sustainability. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with top-level port managers from six European countries. The responses from the interviewees were analysed using Grounded Theory's constant comparative analysis. The findings show that European ports have engaged in gender equality measures aimed at contributing to sustainability through gender equality in five stages: (1) Gender segregation, which needs to be overcome, and is, in many cases, the starting point; (2) Compliance with national laws and regulation; (3) Gender equity; (4) Gender equality; and (5) More sustainable ports. Internal and external forces affect each of the stages, where thrust forces help ports reduce gender segregation and advance towards becoming more sustainable and drag forces slow or block the efforts and may lead to returning to a previous stage of the framework. The findings were integrated to develop a "Gender equality for sustainability in ports" framework. Gender equality is a sine qua non for ports, and other male oriented industries, in becoming more sustainable.

TI Gender Equality in the "Next Stage" of the "New Age?" Content and Fan
   Perceptions of English Media Coverage of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup
SO SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL
AB This article offers an original contribution by examining both the quantity and quality of English print media coverage of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and how fans perceive and respond to this coverage. It is the first longitudinal analysis of media coverage of women's football in the United Kingdom and compares print media coverage between the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cups. We draw on a content analysis of five English national newspapers and 49 semistructured interviews with fans. We develop new theoretical insights through the development of our framework of the "next stage" of the "new age." Our findings show media coverage of women's football has substantially increased, with respectful coverage sustained. The new theme of gender equality made visible several types of inequality, but the media industry failed to acknowledge its own role in reinforcing gender inequalities. Interviewees were critical of the time-limited "revolution" whereby coverage was limited to the duration of the World Cup. To advance gender equality, future media coverage must be sustained, meaningful, and prominent.

TI From gender equality to household earnings equality: The role of women's
   labour market outcomes across OECD countries
SO RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY
AB We assess the impact that full gender equality in the labour market would have on earnings inequality between households, and then decompose that impact by looking separately at the roles played by gender gaps in employment, hours, and pay. We do this by applying a reweighting method to LIS data for 22 OECD countries, across North America, Europe, and Australia. We find that full equality in earnings and employment between women and men would reduce household earnings inequality considerably, with the most substantial reductions coming from closing the gender gap in employment as opposed to closing the gaps in pay and hours worked. A 10% counterfactual decrease in the gender employment gap (relative to the country baseline) is associated with an average 0.6% decline in the Gini for household earnings inequality. Reducing the gender employment gap is thus the pathway through which greater gender equality may most strongly mitigate overall earnings inequality among households: these two key goals for contemporary societies can be pursued simultaneously.

TI Feminist activism in Austria-and its way to escape a spiral of silencing
   and inner exile
SO INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS
AB Recent political developments in European countries indicate a shift to the political right and an increase in attacks on gender equality. This political change has also started to influence scholarly work and teaching of equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) topics in Austria and has led to its re-contextualization by pinpointing the rising counter forces to EDI issues. This text fills a knowledge gap on the EDI counter forces and the experi-ences of EDI experts and researchers by exploring their increasing silence in these times of change to the right. Based on a participatory action research project, the paper shows that a (self-)reflection on silence opens a demand for recollecting in 'safe spaces.' The paper demonstrates that these spaces do not only allow a reflection on how to overcome a double fault line triggered by losing previous EDI supporters and a newly invigorated gender equality opposition. These spaces also give support in escaping the spiral of si-lence and inner exile. The text discusses strategies addressed in these safe spaces to counter a retraction of existing gender equality policies.

TI Contradictory values in doctoral education: a study of gender
   composition in disciplines in Swedish academia
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Contradictory values in the Swedish doctoral education system are analysed through an interview and survey study of different academic disciplines: female-dominated, mixed and male-dominated. The focus is directed towards how the selected disciplines conduct application and selection processes in doctoral education and special attention is given to values regarding doctoral ideals, what a successful thesis should be like, how gender balance or imbalance is explained, and how activities aiming at gender equality are carried out. In the findings of this study, some specific patterns that show gendered discipline cultures in relation to doctoral education are apparent. The analysis shows an unclear or ambivalent view on gender and gender equality work in doctoral educations. In many of the issues investigated, essentialist views on gender emerge and a focus on gender differences is evident. The implicit assumption is that men and women are different and contribute to the discipline in disparate ways. The effectiveness of gender-specific doctoral strategies and to what extent gender equality work is viewed as a support strategy for women only, is discussed.

AB Aims and method. Manhood is culturally defined as a precarious social status. Men, compared to women, are more engaged in zero-sum thinking when feeling threatened and by hostile sexism, they can preserve their dominance over women. The aim of this paper is to confirm whether precarious manhood beliefs (4 items, alpha=0.75) and zero-sum thinking (4 items, alpha= 0.79) fuelled by hostile sexism in the workplace (3 items, alpha=0.73) decrease support for gender equality (6 items, alpha=0.9) among Slovak male undergraduate university students (N=284). Study is drawn on Slovak data collected online in 2019 as part of the large international project - Towards Gender Harmony.
   Results. Results of mediation analysis proved for men in the sample that precarious manhood beliefs and zero-sum thinking predict lower support for gender equality movements, indirectly via increase of hostile sexism. The model allows to explain 25% of the variance of hostile sexism and 7% of the variance of intention to support collective action on behalf of gender equality.
   Conclusions. Effort to reduce gender discrimination in the workplace may be adversely affected by perceived uncertainty about men's status and belief in the loss of status in favour of women.
   Limits. Research sample, design of the study, and other limitations of the study are discussed further.

An analysis of interview data through the lens of feminist institutionalism reveals European Union membership as integral to the emergence of Wales' approach to gender equality, with Welsh equality advocates using access to European Union norms and funding to establish and legitimize more progressive institutions to advance equality, overcoming domestic resistance and gatekeeping. In turn, research exposes structural risks for Wales' equalities agenda post-Brexit. Recent equality-related activity in Wales partially mitigates against post-Brexit risks, although vulnerabilities remain.

AB This paper suggests a simple model for the relationships between poverty, schooling and gender inequality. It argues that poverty-at both national and household levels-is associated with an under-enrolment of school-age children, but that the gendered outcomes of such under-enrolment are the product of cultural practice, rather than of poverty per se. Using detailed case study material from two African countries, evidence is presented to show the variety and extent of adverse cultural practice which impede the attendance and performance of girls at school, relative to boys. It follows that gender inequalities in schooling outcomes, measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, will not necessarily be reduced as incomes rise. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
