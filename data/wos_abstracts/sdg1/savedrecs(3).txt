TI Human Poverty Alleviation through Rural Women's Tourism Entrepreneurship
SO JOURNAL OF CHINA TOURISM RESEARCH
AB The rapid development of rural tourism is encouraging rural women to actively participate in tourism entrepreneurship. Rural women's involvement in tourism entrepreneurship has not only contributed to economic poverty reduction but has also provided feasible paths for alleviating knowledge poverty, rights poverty and other features that promote the overall alleviation of human poverty. This study investigated the multiple dimensions of poverty alleviation of women through tourism entrepreneurship in rural China. Qualitative research methods were applied in this study. Through a thematic analysis, five dimensions of rural women's poverty alleviation through tourism entrepreneurship were identified, namely physical and mental health poverty alleviation, cultural literacy poverty alleviation, participation in public affairs poverty alleviation, living environment poverty alleviation and self-value poverty alleviation. Suggested actions for human poverty alleviation through tourism entrepreneurship are also provided, which will promote sustainability in rural women's tourism entrepreneurship.

TI China's poverty alleviation over the last 40 years: successes and
   challenges
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB Over the past 40 years, China has made significant progress towards its poverty alleviation goals. The rural population under the current poverty line has decreased by 739.9 million. China has contributed to more than 70 per cent of world poverty reduction. To better promote the new anti-poverty strategy and to serve as a reference for poverty alleviation in other developing countries, this paper summarises the main experiences of China's poverty alleviation over the past 40 years and then discusses the challenges associated with implementing the targeted poverty alleviation policy in the new era. China's experience with poverty alleviation includes development-oriented poverty alleviation, improving self-development capabilities of the poor population, encouraging multiple subjects to participate in poverty alleviation and focusing on innovation and ways to improve poverty alleviation. Although China's poverty alleviation initiatives have achieved significant successes, there are still several challenges that should be of concern in the coming years, such as the diminishing marginal effect of financial inputs on poverty alleviation, the resulting negative incentives for the poor to improve their internal motivations and the insufficient participation of markets and social forces in poverty alleviation. Given these challenges, this paper provides suggestions for anti-poverty policies beyond 2020.

AB With the continuous advancement of the "four comprehensive" strategies, the task of poverty alleviation and the development of the poverty-stricken population out of poverty is imminent. The goal of achieving full poverty alleviation in 2020 is close at hand. As the key to boosting poverty alleviation, finance must be strengthened because of its necessary role. Targeted poverty alleviation through finance should be combined with industrial poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation to achieve poverty alleviation, implement targeted measures, and provide strong financial support for fulfilling poverty reduction tasks on schedule and winning the fight against poverty. This paper defines the concept of financial targeted poverty alleviation, analyzes the current poverty in rural areas and the current status of targeted poverty alleviation, and explores the appropriate poverty alleviation model for rural finance. In addition, through the four perspectives of policy support, demonstration-driven, innovation model, and intensified assessment, the analysis of poverty alleviation strategies is conducted, and corresponding policies for poverty alleviation in rural areas are proposed.

Poverty is highly correlated with many negative measurable aspects of standards of living and therefore reducing poverty can have a positive impact on the lives of millions of people around the world. There is much to learn about poverty reduction through examining examples in Asia, as it is the region of the world which has both the most people currently living in poverty and has had the most success in reducing poverty.

The paper also examines the main poverty alleviation policies implemented in rural areas over the past 10 years and assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of these policies from the perspective of targeting accuracy. It is found that China has achieved significant progress in rural poverty reduction in recent decades, although the speed of poverty reduction has varied from one period to another. The largest contribution to rural poverty reduction has been economic growth, which has been increasingly offset by the inequality effect on poverty reduction. In addition, poverty alleviation policies are effective, but not efficient.

Different from other ways of poverty alleviation, PV poverty alleviation has a "hematopoietic function", and is a clean energy which can play a positive role in the protection of the environment. However, due to the long investment cycle, the risk and slow return of funds, it is difficult to quickly raise the required funds. This paper divides the existing poverty alleviation model in China into three categories: government investment type, farmer loan type and enterprise donation type. Through the analysis of three financing modes, this paper will provide some reference for the fund-raising strategy of PV poverty alleviation in China.

AB Education poverty alleviation is an endogenous mechanism to explore poverty alleviation in contiguous poverty-stricken areas, which is an important support for the implementation of precision poverty alleviation strategy, and it is the key path to change "blood transfusion poverty alleviation" as "hematopoietic poverty alleviation". It is of great significance to solve employment, stimulate economic growth and promote the income of poor households.

To promote education and knowledge poverty alleviation and get out of poverty, it not only need to make full use of the power of culture and the means of knowledge to implement the knowledge poverty alleviation project, achieving the goal of "taking the lead in poverty alleviation and taking the lead to get rich". And it also need to work closely with governments at all levels and the people in the poverty-stricken areas to combine the top-level design and concrete measures.

TI Exploring the spatial disparities and influencing factors of child
   multidimensional poverty in China
SO APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB Children comprise the most innocent and vulnerable group of people suffering from poverty, and the consequences of child poverty could be detrimental and permanent. Although the literature on child poverty in China is increasing, very little is known about the spatial disparities and influencing factors of child multidimensional poverty in China. To help fill the knowledge gap, this study used spatial autocorrelation analysis and investigated the geographical disparities of child multidimensional poverty in China from 2010 to 2016. Then, the trend of child poverty was predicted through Markov chain analysis. In addition, the factors affecting the regional and provincial differentiation of child multidimensional poverty were examined by the Geodetector method. Results show that (1) Child multidimensional poverty has demonstrated a downward trend since 2010, and the improvement of health has made a greater contribution to the reduction of child poverty than has that of living standards, care and protection and education. (2) Children in the eastern region have low levels of multidimensional poverty, while child poverty is relatively severe in the western region. Among the 25 provinces, child poverty in Sichuan has been the worst from 2012 to 2016. (3) Family conditions, economic development, urbanisation level, support ability and cultural environment are important factors affecting the spatial disparities of child multidimensional poverty. The findings of this study provide essential implications for child poverty reduction in China.

SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY
AB A key target of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is "to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere" by 2030. It is thus imperative to investigate how the poor people themselves perceive extreme poverty. In a Bangladesh context, contrasting lived experiences of the perceived poor and current dollar-based definition of extreme poverty seems to delineate different pictures. If poor people's perceptions largely differ from the existing measure, poverty eradication in global development initiatives might become a mere statistical success. This paper argues that revisiting the existing definition in various country contexts might enhance the noble intention of poverty eradication.

It finds that a $3000 to $4000 child allowance would reduce child poverty in the United States to the level of other developed nations and, due to the costs associated with child poverty, be a cost effective policy change.

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB This paper analyzes child poverty in Bangladesh and China during periods of rapid economic growth. It compares the extent as well as profile of child poverty in both countries. Comparisons on the extent of child poverty over time and across countries are made using a decomposition framework attributing child poverty differences to differences in three components: mean child income, demographic circumstances and the distribution of child income. Child poverty is found to be more extensive in Bangladesh than in China, and is very much a problem for rural children in both countries. The results show that economic growth can reduce child poverty but does not always do so. For understanding changes over time and across countries in the extent of child poverty, it can be necessary to also consider changes/differences in the distribution of child income as well as in the demographic composition.

TI Focus shift needed: From development-oriented to social security-based
   poverty alleviation in rural China
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STUDIES-EPS
AB Over the past 40-plus years since its reform and opening up, China has made remarkable achievements in poverty reduction. It accomplished the task of eradicating absolute poverty at the end of 2020 as scheduled, which is of great significance to both China and the world. Using the China Household Income Project (CHIP) survey data from 2002 to 2018, this paper studies the characteristics of the rural poverty-stricken population and estimates the poverty reduction effect of China's social security which transfers income to the poor. We find that the transferred income targeting the poor population can effectively reduce rural poverty. In the post-2020 era, poverty reduction in China has shifted its focus from eliminating absolute poverty to alleviating relative poverty. Since the majority of the remaining relatively impoverished people in China lack the necessary ability to work, they can hardly throw off poverty through development-oriented poverty alleviation programmes. Therefore, it is necessary to shift the focus of poverty reduction in rural China from development-oriented policies to social security-based policies, which is essential to alleviate relative poverty in the new stage and prevent people from slipping back to poverty.

TI Determinants of financial poverty alleviation efficiency: Evidence from

SO PLOS ONE
AB Poverty alleviation is a common cause for all human beings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in 18 cities in Henan, China, and to explore the factors affecting the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation, so as to contribute new knowledge to the cause of poverty alleviation. Based on the relevant data of 18 cities in Henan, using output-oriented DEA model and Tobit regression model with bootstrap method, this study evaluates the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in various cities in Henan, and explores the determinants of the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. The results show that the overall poverty alleviation efficiency of Henan is high, and the financial poverty alleviation efficiencies of different cities show distinct heterogeneities. The efficiencies of financial poverty alleviation in Zhengzhou and Luoyang are 1, and there are different spaces for improvement in the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in other cities. Financial subsidies are the most important positive factors affecting the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. For every 1% increase in the value of financial subsidies, the poverty alleviation efficiency will increase by 0.213%. The urban-rural dualistic economic structure is negatively correlated with the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. Every 1% increase in the value of the urban-rural dualistic economic structure will reduce the poverty alleviation efficiency by 0.11%. Industrial structure is positively related to the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. For every 1% increase in the value of the industrial structure, the poverty alleviation efficiency will increase by 0.072%. The formulation of financial poverty alleviation policies in various regions should be combined with their own characteristics, and promote the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation by strengthening the advantages and making up for the deficiencies.

TI Urban-rural disparity of child poverty in China: Spatio-temporal changes
   and influencing factors
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB Eradicating child poverty and shrinking urban-rural disparity are the common goals of humanity. In contemporary China, significant differences exist in child poverty between urban and rural regions, despite the remarkable achievements that have been made in child poverty reduction. Using the national datasets of China Family Panel Studies, this study explored the spatio-temporal changes and influencing factors of urban-rural disparity in child poverty (URDCP) in China between 2010 and 2018 based on the Alkire-Foster approach, spatial autocorrelation analysis and Geodetector method. Results indicated that the URDCP has been shrinking since 2010 and that the urban-rural gap in child poverty increased from east to west due to the combined influence of urban-rural differences and regional poverty disparity. The urban-rural differences in child poverty were mainly reflected in the dimensions of nutrition and living standards. Generally, family conditions, mobility and medical resources were the main contributors of spatial variations in URDCP. The findings may provide useful insights into child poverty alleviation in developing countries.

SO PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH
AB The harmful effects of child poverty are well documented. Despite this, progress in poverty reduction in Canada has been slow. A significant gap exists between what is known about eradicating poverty and its implementation. Paediatricians can play an important role in bridging this gap by understanding and advancing child poverty reduction. Establishment of a comprehensive national poverty reduction plan is essential to improving progress. The present review identifies the key components of an effective poverty reduction strategy. These elements include effective poverty screening, promoting healthy child development and readiness to learn, ensuring food and housing security, providing extended health care coverage for the uninsured and using place-based solutions and team-level interventions. Specific economic interventions are also reviewed. Addressing the social determinants of health in these ways is crucial to narrowing disparities in wealth and health so that all children in Canada reach their full potential.

In recent years, although the poverty-stricken areas such as prefecture have achieved initial results, there are some problems to be solved in the mechanism of targeted poverty alleviation. The benefit linking mechanism and the industry poverty alleviation mechanism are not perfect, which leads to the inefficiency of the industry and the result of the industry. Based on the existing industrial poverty alleviation model and specific situation in prefecture, this paper analyzes the problems of targeted poverty alleviation mechanism in the industrial poverty alleviation through the local poverty alleviation effect and experience. Through the enhancement of "hematopoietic" function, innovative benefit link mechanism, and so on, help impoverished households to get rid of poverty.

The study covered the period 1986-2018, while dynamic GMM was employed for the estimations. When poverty reduction was measured by household final consumption expenditure, it was found that the interaction between foreign direct investment and environmental degradation measures failed to contribute to poverty reduction. However, when poverty reduction was measured by the human development index, it was found that the interaction of foreign direct investment and environmental degradation enhanced poverty reduction. When poverty reduction was measured by life expectancy, the interaction term of FDI and carbon dioxide (CO2) was harmful to poverty reduction, while the interaction terms of FDI with other measures of environmental degradation had no effect on poverty reduction. The implications of the study were discussed.

TI Comparison of Child Poverty Measures: Looking for Consensus
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB There are various child poverty measures. Child poverty can be observed indirectly from resources perspectives and the direct concept of poverty, focusing on outcomes. The differences in child poverty concepts contribute to the variation of child poverty measures. This paper reports a comparison of three child poverty methodologies: monetary and multidimensional child poverty (absolute and relative deprivation). For this purpose, Indonesia was selected as a case study. The paper uses Indonesian family Life survey (IFLS) data wave 5 that was collected in 2015. The comparison was conducted using the combination of cross-tabulation, the analysis of sensitivity, specificity and predicted values and receiver operating characteristics curves. The comparison confirms that each method informs child poverty differently. There are small overlaps among the measures, and relative deprivation seems to be a 'better' measure for Indonesian context.

SO LAND
AB (1) Background: Poverty eradication is the common goal and challenge of human development. Livelihood capital is the basis for poor families to escape poverty and is also the key to enhancing the ability for sustainable development. (2) Methods: Using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this paper empirically examines the impact of livelihood capital on poverty alleviation. In addition, the mediating effect of land transfer is explored. (3) Results: The results show that human, physical, financial, and social capital all have a significant positive impact on poverty alleviation, while natural capital has a significant negative impact on poverty alleviation. Moreover, land transfer plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between livelihood capital and poverty alleviation. (4) Conclusions: Based on the above findings, we suggest that the government formulate targeted poverty alleviation policies according to rural households' livelihood capital endowment characteristics, reasonably guide the land flow, and achieve sustainable poverty reduction.

TI Effect of Farmland Transfer on Poverty Reduction under Different
   Targeted Poverty Alleviation Patterns Based on PSM-DID Model in Karst
   Area of China
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Rural farmland transfer is a key factor in the successful implementation of targeted poverty alleviation strategies in China. In this paper, a multidimensional index system with 15 indicators from five dimensions, namely, natural, human, physical, financial, and social capital was established. It analyzed the effect of farmland transfer on poverty alleviation under four typical poverty alleviation models implemented in a karst area in China by using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Difference (DID) to analyze 467 rural households questionnaire responses from five representative villages in Guizhou Province. The results show that different models had different effects on poverty reduction. In the model of "three changes" + relocation for poverty alleviation + rural tourism + poor households, farmland transfer was the most effective in poverty alleviation, as attested by its average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) value of 0.44. Rural households' nonfarm income increased significantly to develop rural tourism after relocation from inhospitable areas. In the model of "farmland lease/shareholding" +cooperative + enterprise + poor households, farmland transfer had a moderate effect on poverty alleviation, with an ATT value of 0.06. Its effect on the total income of rural households was the lowest among the four models. This study's results can provide a theoretical reference for solidifying the benefits of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies in karst areas.

TI Promoting the Tripartite Cooperative Mechanism of E-Commerce Poverty
   Alleviation: Based on the Evolutionary Game Method
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB E-commerce agriculture has gradually become an important force in poverty alleviation. Some large e-commerce enterprises in China, such as Alibaba and JD, have carried out poverty alleviation activities with the support of the government. With the enthusiasm of consumers towards the goal of helping farmers, they can continue to develop e-commerce agriculture and efficiently achieve this goal. However, the unstable relationship among e-commerce enterprises, the government, and consumers with regard to poverty alleviation hinders the realization of poverty reduction goals. To promote the cooperation among the three parties under e-commerce poverty alleviation, this study uses the evolutionary game method. First, this study analyzes the collaborative mechanism of the government, e-commerce enterprises, and consumers participating in poverty alleviation. Second, based on the above analysis, a tripartite evolutionary game model is constructed. A payment matrix is established to analyze the factors that affect the strategic choices of participants, and the conditions for promoting the tripartite collaborative mechanism of poverty alleviation are discussed using numerical simulation. The results show the following: (1) The reduction in poverty alleviation costs and the increase in cooperation benefits are important factors in promoting the choice of poverty alleviation strategies. (2) E-commerce enterprises are more sensitive to consumer preferences for helping farmers. When consumer preferences for helping farmers are low, the government's early efforts to participate in poverty alleviation can guide e-commerce enterprises and consumers to participate in cooperative poverty alleviation. (3) The government and e-commerce enterprises can reduce poverty alleviation incentives and agricultural product premiums by increasing the willingness of e-commerce enterprises and consumers to support farmers in the initial stage to promote the participation of all parties in poverty alleviation at a relatively low cost.

TI Does Allocation of Public Spending Matter in Poverty Reduction? Evidence
   from Thailand
SO ASIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB The present paper uses a panel dataset to estimate the marginal returns to different types of government expenditure on agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction in Thailand. The study finds that additional government spending on agricultural research provides the largest return in terms of agricultural productivity and has the second largest impact on rural poverty reduction. Increased investment in rural electrification has the largest poverty reduction impact, mainly through improved nonfarm employment. Rural education has the third largest impact on both productivity and poverty reduction. Irrigation has a positive impact on agricultural productivity, but regional variation is considerable. Government spending on rural roads has no significant impact on agricultural productivity and its poverty reduction impact ranks last among all investment alternatives considered. Additional investment in the Northeast Region has a greater impact on poverty reduction than in other regions.

This article examines poverty reduction goals within the framework of Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also discusses the relationship between poverty reduction and sustainable development. Poverty reduction and sustainable development are inseparable and poverty reduction is the premise for sustainable development. Furthermore, several key bones of contention on the role of poverty reduction and sustainable development and implications of Post-2015 Development Agenda are also discussed. It concludes that to end poverty and inequality should continuously be given top priority for the Chinese government, because poverty reduction is China's soft power. Meanwhile, new ways of poverty alleviation should be explored and government should make great efforts to create a new partnership for poverty reduction and development.

TI The Experience of Poverty Reduction in Rural China
SO SAGE OPEN
AB Since 1978, China has greatly reduced the rural poverty rate. This article provides an overview of the experience of China's poverty reduction. Using panel data from 1996 to 2013 to calculate farmers' income dynamics, we found that the pace of poverty reduction was relatively slow from 1996 to 2002 and that the rate of reversion to poverty was high. Since 2003, the pace of poverty reduction has accelerated, whereas the rate of reversion has decreased. Using econometric ordinary least squares and probit models, we explore the factors that drive poverty reduction. We found correlational evidence that the main reasons for poverty reduction in China since 1996 have been the increase in income from household farms and migrant work. In addition, rural public insurance prevented farmers from falling into poverty.

AB This paper applies improved household income data to reevaluate the levels, trends, composition, and role of social policy in extreme child poverty in the US from 1997 to 2015. We adjust for benefit underreporting and incorporate the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). This reduces the share of children below $ 2 per day from 1.8 per cent to 0.1 per cent in 2015. However, survey data omits the 1.3 million homeless children. Unlike prior literature's focus on single motherhood, citizenship status is more consequential to extreme poverty. We also demonstrate that increases in SNAP generosity and take-up enabled declines in three measures of extreme child poverty.

TI The definition of child poverty: a discussion of concepts and
   measurements
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
AB This paper presents and discusses different concepts of child poverty, alternative definitions of children living in poverty, and measurement efforts in this regard. It addresses such questions as: who are the children living in poverty? Is the issue of children living in poverty recognized by and incorporated into anti-poverty strategies? Have governments, civil society organizations and international organizations identified and adopted policies to reduce child poverty? And is the situation of girls living in poverty taken into account? Several organizations have recently adopted human rights-based approaches to defining children living in poverty, and these definitions are included here. In general, however, the assessment finds that there is a lack of consideration of children's issues in the debate on poverty. The lack of visibility has negative implications for anti-poverty strategies, which seldom consider that children and their rights are central to their design and implementation. In this paper, we argue that the lack of conceptualization and debate on the specificities of child poverty has enormous consequences for policy and, vice versa, that the income generation and sectoral focus of poverty reduction policies discourages a holistic response to children and families.

AB Counselling has a place in shaping responses to the international mandate for poverty eradication. Counselling can influence categories of actors directly, or indirectly through the counselling posture; help explicate the cultural context, perception and basis for eradication of poverty; and serve to motivate and inform normative responses to global poverty. Two major frameworks for poverty eradication can be viewed from a counselling perspective. Social development underscores the normative approach to poverty reduction, accounting for cultural specificity. The human rights perspective underscores universal aspects of poverty eradication goals. Social development leads to an uneven spread of social development objectives and human rights to their levelling across countries and cultures.

TI ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN INDONESIA BEFORE AND AFTER THE

SO BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB This paper assesses the relationship between poverty reduction and economic growth in Indonesia before and after the Asian financial crisis. The annual rate of poverty reduction slowed significantly in the post-crisis period. However, the trend in the growth elasticity of poverty indicates that the power of each percentage point of economic growth to reduce poverty did not change much between the two periods. In both, service sector growth made the largest contribution to poverty reduction in both rural and urban areas. Industrial sector growth largely became irrelevant for poverty reduction in the post-crisis period even though the sector contributed the second-largest share of GDP. Agricultural sector growth, meanwhile, remained important, but in rural areas only. The findings suggest the need to formulate an effective strategy to promote sectoral growth in order to speed up the pace of poverty reduction.

AB In studying China's targeted poverty alleviation policy, this paper models the interaction between local governments and poor households with an evolutionary game. The model predicts that bolstering information access of rural residents can significantly improve the effectiveness of poverty alleviation. Using data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) for 2015, we test this prediction by employing Internet use, TV-viewing and radio-listening as proxy variables of information access. OLS and probit regressions show significant positive effects of targeted people's information access on various measures of poverty alleviation success. Estimations through propensity score matching (PSM) yield similar results. The findings highlight the importance of information access in global poverty alleviation efforts.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB Poverty eradication is a priority for governments worldwide. In this study, a process analysis was performed to rigorously examine poverty eradication in China. First, various stages of poverty eradication in China were identified, and the development of poverty eradication was reviewed to demonstrate the achievements and significant contribution to global poverty eradication. Second, using demographic information, the geographical distribution of rural and impoverished populations were analyzed to validate the positive correlation between them. Through the targeting process, significant geographical disparities of impoverished areas in China were clearly revealed, and the impoverished population was further identified. Third, the natural solar energy endowment was thoroughly analyzed to assess the applicability of solar photovoltaics in various areas. Policy development and the anticipated benefits of solar photovoltaic projects for poverty alleviation (PVPPA) were described and evaluated. Finally, China's experiences with PVPPA were discussed. The results indicate that there are some problems associated with the implementation of PVPPA regarding the policy and management schemes, technical support and logistics, and financial resources and assurance. Recommendations to overcome these problems are also discussed. China's PVPPA program introduced here provides valuable insights regarding poverty alleviation, especially regarding the targeting process, participatory development, and profit sharing, and may thus benefit societies worldwide.

TI Effectiveness and limitations of the Earned Income Tax Credit for
   reducing child poverty in the United States
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Based on international comparisons, the United States has a high child poverty rate. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provides a tax benefit to low-income working households and was expanded after the 1990s welfare reform, is currently this country's largest cash transfer program for low-income families with children. This article examines the historical components of the EITC. We then analyze the program's child poverty reduction effectiveness by comparing the percent and percentage point declines in the child poverty rate accounted for by the EITC benefit for six years between 1996 and 2005. Figures for the first four years were drawn from previous studies, while figures for the final two years were estimated with a U.S. Census Bureau calculator. All of the analyses used Current Population Survey data. We determined that the percent decline in the child poverty rate attributed to the EITC generally increased during this period (highest percent was 19.5 in 2005). while the percentage point decline remained relatively stable. We then critically examine four poverty reduction assumptions of the EITC that limit its ability to further reduce child poverty and draw social policy implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The Changing Association Among Marriage, Work, and Child Poverty in the
   United States, 1974-2010
SO JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY
AB Marriage and work have long been central to debates regarding poverty and the family. Although ample research has demonstrated their negative association with child poverty, both marriage and work have undergone major transformations over recent decades. Consequently, it is plausible that their association with child poverty may have also changed. Using 10 waves of U.S. Census Current Population Survey data from the Luxembourg Income Study, this study examined the relationships among marriage, work, and relative measures of child poverty from 1974 to 2010. The results indicated that both marriage and work still decrease the odds of child poverty. However, time interactions showed marriage's negative association with child poverty has declined in magnitude, whereas work's negative association with child poverty has increased in magnitude. These findings underscore the historically varying influence of demographic characteristics for poverty. They also suggest the limitations of overemphasizing marriage and the growing importance of work for reducing child poverty in America.

AB This article develops a child-specific fiscal incidence analysis to quantify the child poverty reduction impacts of public spending and taxes in Belarus, a country with a much higher (and rising) incidence of poverty among children but a clear fiscal commitment towards eradicating child poverty. Our analysis shows that the overall fiscal system in Belarus effectively reduces poverty among children. However, the complexity of social assistance in Belarus leads to a remarkably wide range of impacts on monetary child poverty. The focus on certain households (with children ages 0-2) comes at the expense of households with other vulnerable children (households with multiple children, one parent households and households in rural councils). Policy simulations suggest that increasing access to the means-tested targeted social assistance for all poor households with children and removing the current 6-month restriction would lead to a complete elimination of child poverty at a very low additional fiscal cost.

TI Reducing poverty among children: Evidence from state policy simulations
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB State approaches to reducing child poverty vary considerably. We exploit this state-level variation to estimate what could be achieved in terms of child poverty if all states adopted the most generous or inclusive states' policies. Specifically, we simulate the child poverty reductions that would occur if every state were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four key policies: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and state Child Tax Credits (CTC). We find that adopting the most generous or inclusive state EITC policy would have the largest impact on child poverty, reducing it by 1.2 percentage points, followed by SNAP, TANF, and lastly state CTC. If all states were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in all four policies, the child poverty rate would decrease by 2.5 percentage points, and five and a half million children would be lifted out of poverty.

AB To alleviate poverty must cure foolishness first, and to help the poor must help them increase wisdom first. Educational poverty alleviation, as an important way to block the transmission of poverty from generation to generation, plays an irreplaceable and important role in targeted poverty alleviation. Through the analysis of the effectiveness and deficiencies of educational targeted poverty alleviation for the poor, it is found that these deficiencies exist in the current educational targeted poverty alleviation: the method is not targeted enough, the evaluation mechanism is not perfect, and the participant is deficient. We should give full play to the basic and guiding role of education in targeted poverty alleviation, and ensure the precision of poverty alleviation way by setting up the big data service platform of educational targeted poverty alleviation. In addition, we should improve the dynamic supervision and evaluation system of educational poverty alleviation, realize the timeliness of poverty alleviation, construct a pattern of educational targeted poverty alleviation with multiparticipant cooperation, promote the poverty-stricken population to get rid of poverty and block the transmission of poverty from generation to generation.

TI Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set Similarity Degree Based on Modified Genetic
   Algorithm for Solving Heterogenous Multi-dimension Targeted Poverty
   Alleviation Data Scheduling Problem
SO EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Targeted poverty alleviation is a proposed concept in comparison with extensive poverty alleviation. It mainly aims at the poverty situation of different rural areas and farmers in China and adopts scientific and reasonable methods to carry out targeted assistance policies. It executes accurate management for the targeted poverty alleviation. This way for poverty alleviation is more precise. In the research of heterogenous multi-dimension targeted poverty alleviation data scheduling, the multi-dimension processing is very important. In this paper, we propose an intuitionistic fuzzy set similarity degree based on modified genetic algorithm for solving heterogenous multi-dimension targeted poverty alleviation data scheduling problem. In the proposed algorithm, the reference solution and Pareto solution are mapped to the reference solution intuitive fuzzy set and Pareto solution intuitive fuzzy set respectively. The intuitionistic fuzzy similarity between two sets is calculated to judge the quality of Pareto solution. The similarity value of intuitionistic fuzzy sets is used to guide the evolution of multi--dimension genetic algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the problem of heterogenous multi-dimension targeted poverty alleviation data scheduling, especially, in large scale problems.

TI Child poverty and changes in child poverty
SO DEMOGRAPHY
AB This article offers a cross-country overview of child poverty, changes in child poverty, and the impact of public policy in North America and Europe. Levels and changes in child poverty rates in 12 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during the 1990s are documented using data from the Luxembourg Income Study project, and a decomposition analysis is used to uncover the relative role of demographic factors, labor markets, and income transfers from the state in determining the magnitude and direction of the changes. Child poverty rates fell noticeably in only three countries and rose in three others. In no country were demographic factors a force for higher child poverty rates, but these factors were also limited in their ability to cushion children from adverse shocks originating in the labor market or the government sector Increases in the labor market engagement of mothers consistently lowered child poverty rates, while decreases in the employment rates and earnings of fathers were a force for higher rates. Finally, there is no single road to lower child poverty rates. Reforms to income transfers intended to increase labor supply may or may not end up lowering the child poverty rate.

AB Low productivity and farmer business competitiveness are central issues for agricultural development and rural poverty alleviation. This study aimed to determine the influence of agricultural development on rural poverty alleviation. Data were obtained from farmers' groups in the North Buton Regency in 2019 using questionnaires and analyzed using AMOS. The results showed that agricultural development improves farm business performance and influences rural poverty alleviation. Farm business performance leads to rural poverty alleviation. The influence of agricultural development on rural poverty alleviation was magnified when supported by improved farm enterprise performance. Therefore, agricultural development is the flagship program for poverty alleviation of rural farmers in the North Buton Regency.

TI Road construction, economic growth, and poverty alleviation in China
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB Improving transportation infrastructure has been recognized as a necessary instrument for a region to achieve economic growth and poverty alleviation. A systematic assessment of the impact of China's transportation improvements on economic growth and poverty reduction is insufficient, especially in the context of China's targeted poverty alleviation policies. This study first constructed a theoretical framework of road construction promoting economic growth and poverty alleviation. Then, based on county panel data from 2014 to 2018, the spatial analysis technology was applied to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of China's road construction and rural poverty alleviation, and finally, a mediating effect model was used to quantitatively measure the impact of road construction on economic growth and poverty alleviation. Results indicate that China has made remarkable achievements in road construction and poverty reduction over the past five years. Road and railway mileage increased by 14 times and 0.66 times, respectively. Road construction in poor areas was dominated by low-grade roads and railways. There was a mediating effect between road construction and poverty alleviation, and economic growth was the mediating variable between them. The poverty reduction effects of different road levels varied with poverty levels and across regions. But on both the national and regional scale, the poverty reduction effect of road construction was higher than that of railways. The effect of high-grade road construction on poverty reduction in poor areas was more obvious than that of low-grade roads. The poverty reduction effect of the primary road construction was 2-3.5 times that of the tertiary road. The poverty reduction effects of railway construction and road construction followed a gradually increasing gradient from east to west. These results indicate that transportation infrastructure construction is an important way to promote economic growth and poverty alleviation in poor areas. Our findings would provide a scientific basis for transportation infrastructure planning and investment decision-making in less-developed countries.

TI Extreme poverty and global responsibility
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB This essay addresses the questions of whether and how much responsibility for extreme poverty should be assigned to global and domestic institutional orders. The main focus is on whether the global order brings about the existing levels of extreme poverty or merely allows them. By examining Thomas Pogge's recent contribution on this topic, I argue that although he builds a plausible case for the claim that the global order brings about, and not merely fails to prevent, extreme poverty, the moral and empirical complexity of the situation leaves room for doubting his conclusions. I conclude, however, that it is enough that there be a reasonable chance-though not conclusive evidence-that the global order brings about the existing extreme poverty to reduce considerably the moral weight of its privileged participants' appeal to cost when justifying their not taking steps to alleviate extreme poverty.

SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB To realize efficient and sustainable poverty alleviation, this study firstly investigated the identification of multidimensional poverty and relative poverty, and then explored relevant poverty alleviation pathways. Poverty levels in 31 provinces including the autonomous regions and municipalities of China were identified at the county level using the average nighttime light index (ANLI), county multidimensional development index (CMDI), and a method combining multidimensional poverty index and relative poverty standards. Poverty alleviation pathways for poverty-stricken counties were explored from the aspects of industry, education, tourism and agriculture. The results revealed that nearly 60% of counties in China were primarily under relative poverty, most of which were corresponded to light relative poverty. In terms of ANLI and CMDI, 63% and 79% of the national poverty-stricken counties, as of 2018, could be identified, suggesting that CMDI had a higher performance for identifying poverty at the county level. In terms of poverty alleviation pathways, 414, 172, 442, and 298 poverty-stricken counties were receptive to industry poverty alleviation, education poverty alleviation, tourism poverty alleviation, and agriculture poverty alleviation, and 61% of counties had more poverty-causing factors, implying that multidimensional poverty alleviation is suitable in most of the counties.

The empirical models used for data analyses are the pro-poor growth indices that measure the connection between total poverty reduction and poverty reduction that results from a distribution-neutral growth from absolute perspective and relative perspective. The study finds that economic growth could not have been absolutely poverty-reducing or relatively poverty-reducing because growth was non-pro-poor despite the episode of economic prosperity.

TI Universalism under siege? Exploring the association between targeting,
   child benefits and child poverty across 26 countries
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB The long-standing wisdom that universally designed benefits outperform targeted benefits in terms of poverty reduction has come under siege. Recent empirical studies tend to find that targeting is not necessarily associated anymore with lower levels of poverty reduction. In this study, we investigate for a broad set of European countries (1) the relationship between child benefits and child poverty reduction; (2) whether a universal or targeted approach is more effective in reducing child poverty; and (3) the causal mechanisms explaining the link between (1) and (2). In doing so, we take into account the general characteristics of the child benefit system, the size of the redistributive budget and the generosity of benefit levels. In contrast to previous studies, we construct an indicator of targeting that captures the design instead of the outcomes of child benefit systems. We find that targeting towards lower incomes is associated with higher levels of child poverty reduction, conditional on the direction of targeting and the characteristics of the benefit system.

TI Poverty reduction through entrepreneurship: incentives, social networks,
   and sustainability
SO ASIAN BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB Research on poverty reduction through entrepreneurship has often emphasized external help from government or charitable institutions. Evidence from China is used to argue that poverty reduction through entrepreneurship is an internal process which helps the poor to undertake positive actions to reduce their poverty. To conventional analyses emphasizing endogeneity and sustainability, social networks rooted in nostalgia are proposed as another determinant of the success of entrepreneurial poverty reduction initiatives. That expanded theoretical framework provides a refined and deeper understanding of how poverty reduction through entrepreneurship succeeds or fails.

TI Measurement of Multidimensional Child Poverty: Evidence from North

SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This study describes the multidimensionality of child poverty and produces the first multidimensional child poverty indices in North Macedonia. We use the Alkire-Foster method to develop two age-specific (0-4 years and 5-17 years) child multidimensional poverty indices (MPIs) by leveraging secondary data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2018/2019 for North Macedonia and North Macedonia Roma Settlements. We find that the largest part of multidimensionally poor children are deprived within the range 33 - 39% of deprivations and the structure of multidimensional child poverty is similar for less, as well as for more intensely deprived children in both age-groups. Additionally, we identify the most deprived groups with respect to the area of living, ethnicity, and geographical location. The study provides general recommendations for policymakers to reduce child poverty in North Macedonia.

TI Social structure and child poverty
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Child poverty, as a critical indicator of the QOL, is intricately related to the social structure of the community. This hypothesis is explored for the 159 counties of Georgia for the year 2000. The influence of demographic, economic, family and health factors upon child poverty are explored through models of total, black and white child poverty. Factor analyses of factors uncovered by the models identify the social-structural features of counties in relation to child poverty. Counties considered "Deprived/rural" harbor child poverty, while counties described as "Business/money" and "Progressive/urban" bear a negative relationship to child poverty. Positively associated with child poverty are residential stability, unemployment, low educational achievement, youth and age dependency, single-parent female household heads with children, grandparent child care, and health disability of child, elders and of working-age persons. Structural factors militating against child poverty are persons with greater education, higher population density, out migration, larger married population, higher retail sales, larger middle class families, higher weekly wages, and other structural features of the county.

TI Child Poverty in an Affluent City: Trends and Risk Factors in Hong Kong

SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB The present study explored the salient characteristics of families experiencing child poverty in Hong Kong by analysing two representative cross-sectional datasets from the 2011 Population Census and 2016 By-census. Specifically, to identify trends in child poverty rates and the risk factors underlying these trends, the relative importance of personal demographic, parental, and household characteristics in predicting the likelihood of experiencing child poverty in 2011 and 2016 was explored with samples of 41,265 and 40,127 children aged under 15 respectively. Analyses indicated that child poverty rates in Hong Kong are 21.8% in 2011 and 22.6% in 2016. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the common use of Putonghua or other Chinese dialects at home, having parents with low human capital and unemployed or employed in a non-high paying position, single-parent family structure, and having a high number of non-working dependents are significantly associated with child poverty between 2011 and 2016. Varying between the two census years, but no less significant in predicting child poverty risk, was the child's ethnic background. In the light of the findings, the importance of adopting contextually appropriate age ranges of the 'child' in child poverty research and some policy implications are discussed.

TI Poverty and child health in the UK: using evidence for action

Child poverty is associated with a wide range of health-damaging impacts, negative educational outcomes and adverse long-term social and psychological outcomes. The poor health associated with child poverty limits children's potential and development, leading to poor health and life chances in adulthood. This article outlines some key definitions with regard to child poverty, reviews the links between child poverty and a range of health, developmental, behavioural and social outcomes for children, describes gaps in the evidence base and provides an overview of current policies relevant to child poverty in the UK. Finally, the article outlines how child health professionals can take action by (1) supporting policies to reduce child poverty, (2) providing services that reduce the health consequences of child poverty and (3) measuring and understanding the problem and assessing the impact of action.

The accurate poverty alleviation goal is to help people lift themselves out of poverty and increase income. Research on the poverty alleviation model in agriculture from perspective of supply-side reform is conducive to effectively driving the poor to get rid of poverty and become rich relying on agriculture. This paper addresses that to promote agricultural poverty alleviation from the supply-side perspective requires the coordination of agricultural supply structure and demand characteristics, the convergence of supply quality and demand level. So that the allocation of agricultural resources factors becomes more reasonable and the qualitative efficiency and competitiveness of agricultural development have been improved.

TI Corporate social responsibility and firm value: evidence from Chinese
   targeted poverty alleviation
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose Whilst the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance has been well documented, CSR has rarely been studied from the perspective of corporate poverty alleviation. This study aims to test whether participation in targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) affects firms' market value and to explore how the magnitudes of market value vary in different CSR environments. Design/methodology/approach Based on recent Chinese TPA initiatives and on 108 TPA announcements of Chinese-listed firms from 2016 to 2020, this study adopts an event study method to investigate the impact of firm's TPA announcements on the firm's market value. Then, the authors construct a cross-sectional regression to analyse different CSR factors that may affect market reactions. Findings The results demonstrate that TPA announcements can increase a firm's overall market value. Additionally, the results show that TPA way and firm ownership significantly moderate the market reaction, namely the positive reaction is more significant when the TPA announcements involve charity poverty alleviation rather than industrial poverty alleviation and for privately owned firms rather than state-owned firms. Practical implications The empirical results help TPA practitioners obtain a nuanced understanding of whether and when to participate in poverty alleviation is worthwhile. This study also provides a reference for poverty alleviation work in countries with similar backgrounds. Originality/value This study not only provides empirical evidence for the consequences of poverty alleviation behaviour of firms in developing countries, but also complements the field of CSR research in developed countries.

TI Targeted poverty alleviation and corporate investment efficiency:
   evidence from China
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB Broadly mobilizing social forces including firms to jointly promote poverty eradication is the key characteristics of China's targeted poverty alleviation. Based on the hand-collected information from the annual reports and CSR reports disclosed by A-share companies from 2016 to 2017, we exam how targeted poverty alleviation participation impacts firm investment efficiency. Using a PSM-DID design, we find that participating firms in targeted poverty alleviation have seen a decline in investment inefficiency, which is reflected as overinvestment. The path analysis shows that the decrease in investment efficiency is driven primarily by the increase in investment opportunities and loan resources resulting from targeted poverty alleviation policies, especially for the local government-controlled SOEs, and firms from the regions with less pressure to reduce poverty. The overall results imply the misallocation of the political resources for these firms. In addition, we find that the targeted poverty alleviation participation has positive impacts on firm performance, which implies that firm engaged in targeted poverty alleviation do not decrease shareholder interests. This paper analyzes how firms serve the public interest and how it will impact corporate investment. The results shed light on the experience of poverty eradication and provide insights into the sustainability of poverty alleviation.

So the author gave the advice from the three aspects: government, enterprises and low-income families, in the hope of promoting industrial poverty alleviation, and accelerating rural revitalization.

TI Child poverty policies across Europe
SO ZEITSCHRIFTE FUR FAMILIENFORSCHUNG-JOURNAL OF FAMILY RESEARCH
AB This article is in two parts. In the first part, we present the results of a comparative analysis of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) to explore child poverty. Countries' child poverty rates are compared using the conventional income definition and deprivation and economic strain. The extent of overlap in these different measures is explored. Variations in child poverty rates by employment, child age, number of children, education level of the parents and family type are explored. Then logistic regression is used to explore how countries' child poverty varies having taken account of these characteristics.
   In the second part we explore how policy affects child poverty, presenting child poverty rates before and after transfers; analysis of spending and its relationship to child poverty; and the analysis of child benefit packages using model family methods. Child poverty is increasing in most EU countries. The article argues that the data available on what policies work is not really good enough. The OECD Benefits and Wages series is too limited and the EU should invest in a framework that collects data on how tax and benefit policies are working to combat child poverty across the EU.

TI A Statistical Measurement of Poverty Reduction Effectiveness: Using
   China as an Example
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Poverty is no longer a problem of income alone. Healthy poverty and capacity poverty have become key factors affecting the poverty reduction effectiveness. Based on "double cut-offs" multidimensional poverty identification method of Alkire and Foster (J Public Econ 95(7-8): 476-487, 2011), this paper proposes a "triple cut-offs" identification method of multidimensional poverty reduction effectiveness, and construct the chronic multidimensional poverty reduction index combined with chronic thinking of Foster (in: Addison T, Hulme D, Kanbur R (eds) Poverty dynamics: interdisciplinary perspectives. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp 59-76, 2009). And this index can comprehensively and systematically measure the China's multidimensional poverty reduction effectiveness in terms of both poverty alleviation and poverty returning. In this paper, we find that China's chronic multidimensional poverty alleviation index is greater than the country's chronic poverty returning index, and the chronic multidimensional poverty alleviation/returning index in rural and western regions is greater than that in its cities and other regions in China. The chronic poverty alleviation of per capita net income and medical insurance have contributed a lot to the overall chronic multidimensional poverty alleviation of China's rural residents, while poverty returning caused by health and housing difficulties has contributed a lot (48.14%) to the chronic multidimensional poverty alleviation of the country's urban residents. These findings can provide more targeted guidance for poverty governance.

TI UK policy: A success story?
SO PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH
AB Child poverty is at the heart of the United Kingdom (UK) government's social policy agenda. Child poverty rose rapidly in the 1980s; the child poverty rate was one of the highest in Europe by 2000. In 1999, the government's objective was to reduce child poverty by 50% by 2004/2005, which it narrowly failed to meet. In 2005/2006, there was an increase in child poverty. An index of child well-being found that the UK was 21st Out of the 25 European Union countries. Overall, the UK came in last in the UNICEF well-being index. The government's child poverty strategy has been to manage the economy to maximize employment and to improve in-work incomes. Both have been successful in reducing child poverty. Out-of-work incomes have also been improved, but not enough to lift many children out of poverty. Public expenditure on services, especially health, education and childcare, has also increased; although there are questions about how much of this extra spending has focused on children and child poverty. The comprehensive spending review, reporting later in 2007, is likely to be tight, and it is now unlikely that the government will Succeed in its aim of reducing child poverty by 50% by 2010 unless there are radical changes in policy. Constraints on the government's ability to do this include the structural inequalities in British society and public attitudes toward people in poverty.

AB Given that there are problems of difficulty to identify accurately the poverty alleviation subjects' demands. This research puts forward and applies the fuzzy proximity method on the basis of the fuzzy set theory. The method can identify accurately the demands of poverty alleviation subjects. This study calculated the fuzzy proximity vector and the positive and negative ideal grades of the four demand types, according to six poverty characteristic indexes. The demand types are determined. Then, the paper takes a case about the demand identification of a poverty alleviation subject in a village, Shanxi province in China. The application result showed that (1) the demand identification model can help identify accurately the demands of poverty alleviation subjects; (2) the poverty alleviation strategies provide a reference for the government to carry out poverty alleviation work.

TI Analysis on the Role and Effect of Inclusive Finance in the Development
   of Green Ecological Industry under the Background of Poverty Alleviation
SO EKOLOJI
AB Poverty reduction involves both balanced development and human rights protection. Poverty reduction is a world-class challenge. With the development of economy, China has done a lot of work to alleviate poverty and accumulated rich experience, making a worldwide contribution to eradicate poverty. Although countries are different, the goals and approaches to poverty reduction are consistent. When a country's economic aggregate grows to a certain extent, it is inevitable to promote a more balanced development, and China has just arrived at this stage. In recent years, China has made great efforts in poverty reduction, and has put forward some experience of world reference in terms of regional connection, mechanism construction and accountability assessment. Especially since poverty alleviation became an important national strategy, China has invested a lot of people, money and goods and made great efforts to realize common prosperity. There are many ways to reduce poverty, and the use of financial instruments in poverty reduction is a universal tool and method throughout the world. Since the United Nations put forward the concept of inclusive finance, the role of inclusive finance in China's poverty reduction has been playing more and more fully. The application mode of financial tools is also of vital importance. According to the characteristics of highly consistent between poverty-stricken areas and severe ecological environment areas in China, this paper proposes that financial tools play a better role in industries, especially the green ecological industry, which has a substantial role in poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper chooses the role and effect of inclusive finance in China's poverty reduction work as the entry point, and analyzes its practical application effect. The purpose is to provide Suggestions for the further development of inclusive finance through analysis.

Although a number of studies have been done on the impact of FDI on poverty reduction, the majority of these studies have focused on the indirect impact of FDI on poverty reduction. The bulk of the literature reviewed supports the positive effects of foreign direct investment on poverty reduction, although a few studies have also found foreign direct investment to have an adverse or insignificant effect on poverty reduction. This study differs fundamentally from previous studies in that it focuses on the direct impact of FDI on poverty reduction, giving a detailed review of the nature of this relationship.

TI Spatial Differentiation and Influencing Factors of Poverty Alleviation
   Performance Under the Background of Sustainable Development: A Case
   Study of Contiguous Destitute Areas in Hunan Province, China
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB Poverty eradication is a realistic requirement for the addressing of the urban-rural development imbalance. It consolidates the achievements of the poverty alleviation, and accelerates the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In research that deals with poverty, qualitative analysis is often used to study the connection between a single influencing factor and poverty reduction, and to solve regional poverty through government measures. However, these studies usually ignore the multidimensional nature of poverty, and the fact that poverty alleviation also needs to be approached from multiple perspectives. By constructing a theoretical framework of poverty alleviation performance from the perspective of sustainable development, this study selects contiguous poverty-stricken areas in the Hunan Province, China as the empirical study area, constructs an evaluation index system from the three dimensions of economic development, infrastructure and people's livelihood security, and selects influencing factors from three aspects of 'population', 'land' and 'industry'. The spatial differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of poverty alleviation performance in poverty-stricken areas were studied by using the methods of entropy weight method and geodetector. The results show: firstly, in the concentrated and contiguous poverty-stricken areas of the Hunan Province, the performance of poverty alleviation in the economic development makes little difference, showing a 'high-medium-low' cross-distribution pattern. The poverty alleviation performance of the infrastructure presents a distribution pattern of 'low in the middle and high on both sides. The poverty alleviation performance of people's livelihood security has significant spatial differentiation characteristics, which all present a reunion distribution. The overall poverty alleviation performance varies greatly, showing a funnel-shaped distribution in space. Secondly, the spatial differentiation of poverty alleviation performance in the concentrated and contiguous poverty-stricken areas of the Hunan Province is the result of the combined effects of multiple factors. 'Population' is the dominant factor affecting the performance of poverty alleviation, 'land' is the basic factor that causes the spatial differentiation of poverty alleviation performance, and 'industry' is the key factor for the improvement of the poverty alleviation ability.

TI Poverty and relapse risk in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia:
   a Children's Oncology Group study AALL03N1 report
SO BLOOD
AB The association between individual-level poverty and relapse in children receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains unclear. In a secondary analysis of COG-AALL03N1, we used data from US Census Bureau to categorize patients living below year-specific federal poverty thresholds, calculated using self-reported annual household income and size of household. Participants with federal poverty thresholds above 120% of their yearly household income were categorized as living in extreme poverty. Hazard of relapse was estimated using multivariable proportional subdistributional hazards regression for patients living in extreme poverty while receiving ALL maintenance therapy after adjusting for relevant predictors. Among 592 patients in this analysis, 12.3% of the patients were living in extreme poverty. After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years from study enrollment among those living in extreme poverty was significantly higher (14.3%) than those not living in extreme poverty (7.6%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that children living in extreme poverty had a 1.95-fold greater hazard of relapse than those not living in extreme poverty; this association was mitigated after the inclusion of race/ethnicity in the model, likely because of collinearity between race/ethnicity and poverty. A greater proportion of children living in extreme poverty were nonadherent to mercaptopurine (57.1% vs 40.9%); however, poor adherence did not completely explain the association between poverty and relapse risk. Future studies need to understand the mechanisms underlying the association between extreme poverty and relapse risk.

TI Towards A Virtuous Spiral Between Poverty Reduction And Growth:
   Comparing Sub Saharan Africa With The Developing World
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The positive impact of growth on poverty reduction has been well documented and confirmed. In contrast, the impact of poverty reduction on subsequent growth has not been systematically investigated. The main objective of this paper is to explore empirically the reverse causality between poverty and growth. Using data from 129 developing countries (44 in SSA) during 1981-2018, this study finds that faster poverty reduction is linked to faster growth in the developing world and especially the SSA region; while faster growth contributes to faster poverty reduction more in the developing world outside of SSA than within SSA. These findings suggest that for faster poverty reduction in the entire developing world but especially in SSA, we need a pro-growth poverty reduction strategy, where interventions directly target poverty reduction, and through that also contribute to faster growth; as a complement to the more conventional pro-poor growth strategy, where interventions directly target growth and only reduce poverty through growth. The main conclusion is that the combined effects of growth on poverty and of the latter on subsequent growth can lead to a virtuous spiral. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Public procurement, consumers' preference and poverty alleviation
   through consumption
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES
AB Challenges due to poverty immensely burden the world's progress in fulfilling sustainable development goals. Poverty alleviation through consumption (PAC) has explored a market-oriented way of poverty alleviation by transforming consumers' goodwill to help the poor into market purchasing power. This study explores the promise of PAC by utilizing a discrete choice experiment to analyze consumers' preference toward poverty alleviation products and the effect of public procurement on it based on data from China. The results confirm that individual consumers are willing to pay a premium for the attribute of poverty alleviation, and the public procurement of poverty alleviation products can further strengthen the consumers' preference for it. However, consumers still prefer the private attribute (mainly referring to quality and local specialty) over the attribute of poverty alleviation. Public procurement weakens consumers' preference for the attribute of quality, despite strengthening their preference for the local specialty attribute. These findings prove the promise of PAC from the demand side and its relevance for an efficient policy design of poverty alleviation.

TI A Universal Child Allowance: A Plan to Reduce Poverty and Income
   Instability Among Children in the United States
SO RSF-THE RUSSELL SAGE JOURNAL OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB To reduce child poverty and income instability, and eliminate extreme poverty among families with children in the United States, we propose converting the Child Tax Credit and child tax exemption into a universal, monthly child allowance. Our proposal is based on principles we argue should undergird the design of such policies: universality, accessibility, adequate payment levels, and more generous support for young children. Whether benefits should decline with additional children to reflect economies of scale is a question policymakers should consider. Analyzing 2015 Current Population Survey data, we estimate our proposed child allowance would reduce child poverty by about 40 percent, deep child poverty by nearly half, and would effectively eliminate extreme child poverty. Annual net cost estimates range from $66 billion to $105 billion.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Poverty alleviation is an important work of the Chinese government in recent years. According to the international poverty standards of the world bank, China's poverty reduction population accounts for more than 70% of the world. Photovoltaic poverty alleviation is a significant way for regions rich in solar energy resources to transform the advantages of renewable energy resources into the driving force of social and economic development. It is also an effective means for China to implement power poverty alleviation. While promoting emission reduction in these regions, it accelerates economic development and implements targeted poverty alleviation. This paper analyzes the comprehensive benefits of typical market entities of photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects, and establishes the environment, economic and social benefit evaluation models for poor households, the state and government, photovoltaic enterprises and grid corporation. In the model, we creatively put forward an index system to characterize the poverty alleviation effect, and consider the additional industrial benefits brought by photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects. Finally, a typical photovoltaic poverty alleviation project in Haiyuan County, Northwest China is selected to verify the feasibility of this model.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Do political connections affect corporate poverty alleviation decisions?
   Evidence from China
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Programs to alleviate poverty by corporations are increasingly popular as a new form of corporate social responsibility. This study examines how the political connections of a firm's chairperson are associated with decisions to alleviate poverty based on a sample of listed Chinese firms from 2016 to 2018. We find that the chairperson's political connections increase the probability of participation and the amount of investment in programs to alleviate poverty. This positive relationship is mainly manifested in firms with high agency costs and low regional economic conditions. In addition, the chairperson's political connections are not related to the efficiency of the poverty alleviation program. Politically connected firms receive less government recognition with an increase in investment in poverty alleviation. Our findings are consistent with the notion that firms participate in poverty alleviation programs for reciprocal favor exchanges, but they fail to manage these programs efficiently.

AB The article examines the contribution of financial development to poverty reduction in developing countries. Building on earlier research which has established links between financial development and economic growth, and between economic growth and poverty reduction, the article tests for a causal process linking financial sector growth and poverty reduction. The empirical results indicate that, up to a threshold level of economic development, financial sector growth contributes to poverty reduction through the growth enhancing effect. The impact of financial development on poverty reduction will be affected, however, by any change in income inequality resulting from financial development.

SO ETIKONOMI
AB The paper examines the response of poverty reduction based on financial development and economic growth in India. The ARDL and ECM based model techniques analyze the long-run and short-run relationship among the variables in the model. The long-run estimates depict that financial development and economic growth have not significantly impacted poverty reduction and, on the other hand, resulted in injecting inequality and becoming attended to wealthier sections of the society. The short-run estimates show that financial development and economic growth have successfully tried to reduce poverty in India. The results flash a long-run nature of poverty in India and need to designs and formulations of policies that should be instrumental in reducing poverty. Impulse Response Functions' application indicates that poverty reduction will act as a catalyst for further poverty reduction in India.

TI From poverty to trust: Political implications of the anti-poverty
   campaign in China
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Despite the rapid decrease in poverty across the developing world, there have been few attempts to analyze the implication of poverty alleviation on regime legitimacy. Bridging the literature on poverty alleviation and political trust, this analysis examines the mechanisms through which poverty reduction affects trust in local elected and appointed officials. Using an original survey on the Target Poverty Alleviation campaign in China and causal mediation analyses, we find that beneficiary status is positively associated with political trust. The perception of anti-poverty governance quality, rather than economic evaluation, is the mediator through which beneficiary status affects political trust. Moreover, the intensified non-formalistic elite-mass linkage developed in the poverty alleviation campaign enhances political trust through the improvement of perception of governance quality. These findings have implications for mechanisms through which poverty reduction affects political trust and the type of political linkage that sustains regime legitimacy.

TI Politics, policies and rural poverty alleviation outcomes: Evidence from
   Lankao County, China
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB China's anti-poverty approach featuring a targeted poverty alleviation strategy has provided a model for global poverty reduction governance. This paper builds a conceptual framework that includes political contexts, policies and rural poverty alleviation outcomes, and emphasizes the response of rural households as micro subjects to the macro political and policy environment, aiming to explore the micro mechanisms of rural poverty reduction governance at the county and rural household levels. The results are as follows: (i) The poverty alleviation outcomes are produced by the stimulation of political and policy resources on rural households' own conditions. (ii) The individual differences in poverty alleviation outcome scores are obvious. The poverty alleviation collaboration mechanism, grassroots mobilization, life improvement, livelihood support, resource conditions and livelihood capacity are the leading factors affecting the poverty alleviation outcomes. (iii) The organic combi-nation of political guidance, policy support and rural households' development conditions has made the poverty alleviation outcomes more remarkable. This study provides case support for the formation of an anti-poverty theory with Chinese characteristics, and serves as a reference for poverty reduction governance in developing countries.

TI Assessing the impact of poverty alleviation programs on poverty
   reduction in Nigeria: Selected programs
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB The menace of poverty can seem unavoidable in a developing country like Nigeria, with well over half the population under the poverty threshold despite several poverty alleviation programs implemented over four decades. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of selected poverty alleviation programs on poverty reduction in Nigeria, covering the period from 1981 to 2015. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and CBN Annual Reports constituted the main sources of data used in this study. Autoregressive distributed lagged models were used in estimating the relationship. Two categories of social intervention programs-"income and wealth redistribution programs" (a proxy for "longevity" in the Multidimensional Poverty Index [MPI] [Category 1]) and "access and empowerment programs" (a proxy for "education attainment" in the MPI [Category 2])-were used, and both were found to reduce the poverty rate. Thus, a percentage point increment in access and empowerment programs reduces the poverty rate by 1.33%. The Category 1 relationship, however, was found to be statistically insignificant. In conclusion, the provision of credit facilities, social capital, and a congenial business environment should be encouraged by both public and private bodies in the poverty alleviation agenda.

AB This study examines the role of energy security in poverty reduction in the 12 poorest Asian economies from 2000 to 2019. We postulated an energy security index using principal component analysis. We adopted the system generalized method of a moment technique to manage endogeneity and dynamism in the model. For robustness, we applied a panel-corrected standard error (PCSE). We found a negative relationship between energy security and poverty reduction, suggesting that energy security helps reduce poverty. We conclude that energy security promotes sustainable poverty alleviation and recommends feed-in tariffs, net metering, tax credits, and energy resource diversification away from fossil fuels.

TI The Impact of Government Official Assessment on Ecological Poverty
   Alleviation: Evidence from Chinese Listed Companies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Ecological poverty alleviation launched by the Chinese government is an innovative green development measure that combines targeted poverty alleviation with ecological protection to realize the ecological environmental protection and income growth of the impoverished population. Based on the Chinese government's policy of poverty alleviation assessment for provincial government officials in 2016, this paper studies whether the assessment of government officials promote enterprises' participation in ecological poverty alleviation. Using the sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2016 to 2020, the empirical test shows that the more important the assessment of poverty alleviation by officials, the more likely local enterprises are to participate in targeted poverty alleviation and the higher the investment level is likely to be. The results pass a series of robustness tests. In addition, this paper further finds that enterprise participation in ecological poverty alleviation can effectively reduce local water pollution, air pollution and solid pollution, thus improving the ecological environment. It suggests that the assessment mechanism of Chinese government officials can effectively promote multi-dimensional ecological poverty alleviation. The contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, it is helpful to expand the relevant literature on enterprise environmental protection from the perspective of ecological poverty alleviation. Secondly, it is helpful to expand the literature related to government-enterprise interaction from the perspective of the assessment of government officials. Finally, it is helpful to enrich and expand the relevant literatures on promotion incentives of government officials from the perspective of ecological poverty alleviation.

AB Poverty eradication is the common ideal of mankind. Currently, as COVID-19 continues to rage around the world, the cause of poverty reduction faces greater challenges. Poverty reduction requires the involvement of multiple parties, and the challenging nature of it determines the complexity of participation in poverty reduction cooperation. In this paper, the link prediction method is used to calculate the path similarity in the network and use the Katz index to predict the connection possibility between unknown links in the poverty alleviation network. Take Sichuan Province as a case to analyze and put forward cooperation suggestions. The results show that in the entire network, all anti-poverty organizations recommend cooperation with one of the government departments, local schools, state-owned enterprises and high quality schools. Among them, government departments and local schools are the most recommended organizations. After the overall victory in the fight against poverty, the governance of relative poverty still requires continuous attention. Through our research, we hope to contribute to a better construction of a new poverty reduction system under the new poverty model.

TI POVERTY ALLEVIATION
SO VIET NAM: A TRANSITION TIGER
AB As well as the 'growing out of poverty' and 'liberalisation as a poverty reduction strategy', the initial conditions inherited from the pre-reform period were important determinants of the general poverty alleviation program.
   This chapter indicates that the performance of the Vietnamese economy in the past decade - in relation to alleviation of poverty has been exemplary, although the alleviation of poverty happened despite the lack of an explicit poverty alleviation strategy or program. In terms of growth and poverty alleviation, market reforms were a key input into the acceleration of agricultural growth, much of it based on the household farm, which has been a critical factor in reducing rural poverty.
   However, while poverty has been reduced, the rate of income improvements among the poor is slower than the average rate. The challenge is how to prevent such inequalities from being consolidated and from becoming the basis of an entrenched class society.

TI Targeted poverty alleviation using photovoltaic power in China:
   Identifying financial options through a dynamic game analysis
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The use of photovoltaic power in poverty alleviation in China is one of the "Ten Targeted Poverty Alleviation Projects" of the government. This type of alleviate poverty features prominently in the planning of both central and local government because it provides for stable earnings, the possibility of extending renewable energy and innovation in energy saving and emissions reduction. However, in the process of implementing projects, attention has been focused on profits derived from the alleviation of poverty rather than the earnings of photovoltaic firms. For this reason, we have undertaken a comparative study of three different financial modes using dynamic game models, with; 1) government contributing all capital, 2) poverty alleviation funds plus loans to poor households and 3) poverty alleviation funds plus investment by photovoltaic enterprises. Results indicate that the income of PV enterprises and poor households under poverty alleviation funds plus loans to poor households grows slowly in the first 5 years, but is equal to that of 100% investment by government in the sixth year. Both the earnings and the range of poverty reduction characterized by the third financial option are higher than those of the other two modes. This highlights the importance of investment by PV enterprises. To motivate enterprises to actively participate in the alleviation of poverty, three strategies are available: (1) the granting of quotas to photovoltaic enterprises for commercial power station construction; (2) the employing of Public Private-Partnership (PPP) modes or Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) modes; (3) the permission for photovoltaic enterprises to issue bonds or use trust investments; (4) support the PV enterprises technologically to reduce their costs.

TI COMBATING CHILD POVERTY IN OECD COUNTRIES: IS WORK THE ANSWER?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SECURITY
AB Child poverty is on the policy agenda in all OECD countries. One of the main issues in the debate about child poverty is the appropriate balance between the "tax and benefits strategy" (increasing the adequacy of benefits for low income families with children) and the "work strategy" (promoting policies to increase employment among poor families). This article assesses the extent to which child poverty is associated with the work status of parents. It is found that child poverty rates are significantly higher for jobless families than for families with at least one parent in employment, and are significantly higher in single earner families than in two-earner families. The analysis finds, however, that in most OECD countries only a minority of poor families with children are jobless. Nevertheless, jobless families are nearly everywhere the most disadvantaged among the poor, and all countries with very low child poverty rates (less than 5%) have low levels of family joblessness. The article assesses the extent to which child poverty can be reduced by policies which successfully promote higher parental employment, identifying wide variations across countries in the effectiveness of different policy approaches.

   Rural Tourism in China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The practice of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism in China generally faces the contradiction of "abundant exogenous motivation and insufficient endogenous motivation", which seriously affects the effect of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to clarify the motivation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism. This paper tries to borrow the force analysis method of the slope model in physics, constructs a general theoretical model of the motivation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism, and compares and analyzes the characteristics of the models of the motivation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism under two different models: government-led and community-led practice. On this basis, through a case analysis of the generating and evolution process of the motivation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism in Liangjiahe village, Yanchuan County, Shaanxi Province, which is a typical example of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism in China, we propose a new model of the motivation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism under the mode of tourism empowerment. The study has some theoretical insights to clarify the dynamic operation mechanism of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism, promote the sustainability of precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism, and realize an effective connection between precise poverty alleviation in rural tourism and rural revitalization in China.

We report a "case study" of child poverty in Canada between 1986 and 2000, a period when the elimination of child poverty was a stated policy goal, but reported child poverty rates did not change significantly. We find that the apparent persistence of child poverty in Canada is remarkably robust to measurement choices, and cannot easily be explained by socioeconomic developments.

TI Life stabilization and resiliency for disabled peonies A critical

SO DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB In 2020, the government of Ontario, Canada, introduced Building a Strong Foundation for Success: Reducing Poverty in Ontario (2020-2025), the province's third poverty reduction strategy. This study employs Critical Discourse Analysis to explore the discourses that emerge in this strategy and examine instances of intertextuality between it and previous strategy iterations. Several discourses (re)emerge suggesting that people living in poverty, and disabled (people) specifically, must 'realize their potential' by becoming more 'resilient' and work towards 'life stabilization'. The 'self-sufficiency' discourse in prior poverty reduction strategies, recast as independence' in this newest rendition, anchors the strategy to problematic understandings of 'dependency: The systemic causes of poverty are negated, as is a rights-based framework for poverty alleviation. The Ontario government does not define the poverty reduction strategy's success in terms of poverty reduction, but as mere social assistance caseload reductions, and as such, has built 'a strong foundation for its lackluster success'.

AB Children experience poverty differently from adults. This is the fundamental premise of the work to design specific, child-focused policies to eliminate child poverty. Devising, planning, and monitoring the impact of these policies without a proper measure of child poverty is almost impossible. However, most attempts to measure and analyze child poverty are challenged by the steps needed to measure it properly. In this article a solution is offered in this regard. In the context of global efforts, including by governments, to eliminate child poverty, UNICEF has developed a position on how to measure child poverty, based on a few simple and clear principles. These principles are meant to guide the measurement of child poverty. The main objective of this article is to explain and provide a rationale for this position as well as its relationship to related debates on child poverty measurement. Child poverty should be measured at the level of the individual child, not just as a disaggregation by age of household-level or adult-centered measurement. The measurement should be based on constitutive rights of poverty (i.e., those crucially and directly determined by access to material resources) and not on all possible problems children may face. As all rights are equally important, all dimensions should be equally weighted. The measurement should provide the prevalence as well as the depth/breadth/severity of child poverty. There are various groups of children who require different or special goods and services to fulfill the same rights constitutive of poverty as all other children. These needs ought to be incorporated into the measurement (e.g., children with disabilities may require assistive devices or indigenous children may require culturally appropriate learning materials). Implications and opportunities for flexibility and adjustment of such measures at the country level (while applying the principles) are also addressed in this article as well as a description of the most recent estimates of child poverty across developing countries using the same dimensions, indicators and thresholds.

TI Pathways to poverty reduction
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB Of the myriad approaches to reducing poverty, which have proved effective on a national scale? This article analyses 15 systematically selected national cases of demonstrated rapid poverty reduction, seeking insights into effective approaches to reducing poverty. From these 15 economies, in which the bottom quintile experienced an annual increase in income of at least 6% over at least a decade, emerge four poverty-reduction pathways: (1) industrialisation, (2) rural development, (3) social welfare and (4) petroleum-generated employment. In addition to helping us understand what policy approaches have actually helped reduce poverty, this article has implications for the understanding of economic growth, the impact of pro-growth policies, the relationship between state and market, and the roles of non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society.

TI Spatial Poverty Reduction in Vietnam: An Application of Small Area
   Estimation
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB This study examines the spatial pattern of poverty reduction in Vietnam during the 2010-2012 period. Although Vietnam experienced an economic slowdown during this period, the poverty rate still decreased from 20.8 percent to 17.2 percent. Poverty decreased in most provinces and districts. There was an inverse U-shaped relationship between the 2010 poverty and poverty reduction during 2010-2012. Provinces and districts with low or high initial poverty rates were less successful in reducing poverty over the reference period, while provinces and districts with average initial poverty rates were more able to reduce poverty most rapidly.

TI The Strategies of the Poverty-Alleviation Supply Chain with Government
   Subsidies and Cost Sharing: Government-Led or Market-Oriented?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Alleviating poverty is a critical problem in many developing countries such as China. In this paper, we consider a poverty-alleviation supply chain composed of one supplier in a poor area and one producer helping the supplier reduce poverty by fulfilling Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Our work aims at examining the impacts of government subsidies and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on the poverty-alleviation operations. Four game-theoretic models are constructed and analyzed to investigate the impacts of coefficients of government subsidies and CSR cost sharing on the supplier's and producer's profits, social welfare growth, CSR level, wholesale price, output of the supplier, and retail price. Our findings suggest that the most effective poverty-alleviation mechanism in most cases is the combination of government subsidies and market efforts. Contrary to common beliefs that companies have to sacrifice profit for social responsibility, we show that poverty alleviation is reconcilable with profit maximization and social welfare improvement, and companies can achieve a win-win situation of both poverty alleviation and profitability. Our work provides new insights for sustainable poverty alleviation and socially sustainable operations.

TI CHILD POVERTY IN PORTUGAL Dimensions and dynamics
SO CHILDHOOD-A GLOBAL JOURNAL OF CHILD RESEARCH
AB This article analyses the extent and persistence of child poverty in Portugal between 1995 and 2001. Data from the Portuguese component of the European Community Household Panel Survey (ECHP) are used to estimate child poverty rates and children's flows in and out of poverty. The article focuses upon an analysis based on family income and on a set of non-monetary indicators. This approach allows a comparison of changes in child income poverty and deprivation and, therefore, tests the consistency of child poverty from a dynamic perspective. Overall, relative child poverty rates in Portugal are among the highest in the EU. Children are a group particularly vulnerable to poverty and show a significant risk of poverty, compared to the population as a whole. Children living in households with three or more siblings, children in lone-parent families and in households headed by an unemployed person present a higher risk of income poverty. In terms of deprivation, the results obtained are, on average, consistent with the outcomes of the family income based analysis. This study of child poverty presents a portrait of child poverty in Portugal, and offers important indicators for social policy design.

TI China's poverty alleviation resettlement: Progress, problems and
   solutions
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Poverty alleviation resettlement (PAR) is a national rural development policy which uses resettlement as a tool for addressing environmental and poverty-related concerns in a rapidly changing world in China. It is regarded as one of the effective ways for the poor shaking off poverty in the implementation process of targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) strategy. Notable progress has been made in poverty alleviation for poverty-stricken people living in regions deemed unable to support sustainable livelihoods while problems have arisen during the process of its implementation. Based on literature review and a field survey, this paper attempts to conclude the beneficial policy as well as typical modes, problems and suggestions which might provide successful experience for regions to effectively implement the PAR projects and promote the management of rural resettlement. This article will offer a holistic and systematic research about China's PAR policy, which will make up for the lack of PAR researches in the context of targeted poverty alleviation. It will offer international experience for ending poverty by 2030 to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI CHILD POVERTY IN BRITAIN: PAST LESSONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
SO NATIONAL INSTITUTE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The previous Labour government pledged to abolish child poverty and introduced a range of welfare reforms that emphasised the role of work as the primary route out of poverty. This culminated in the Child Poverty Act (2010) which commits all future governments to the abolition of child poverty. This paper examines New Labour's record on child poverty and examines the factors responsible for its change. While the welfare reforms of the late 1990s did increase work among families with children, this didn't translate into large falls in child poverty. Those entering work still relied on substantial increases in government benefits to lift them over the poverty line. The current coalition government has reaffirmed its commitment to the Child Poverty Act and is also emphasising the role of work. The lessons of the past decade cast severe doubt on whether the current coalition government strategy of promoting work will be any more successful in reducing child poverty. With planned benefit cuts in the pipeline we could well experience some substantial increases in child poverty over the coming years.

TI Assessing the effectiveness of targeted poverty alleviation policies in
   Xinjiang, China
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB To consolidate and expand the effective connection between the achievements of poverty alleviation in Xinjiang's deeply impoverished areas and rural revitalization, it is necessary to study the effects and mechanisms of poverty alleviation policies. In this paper, the value of night light is used to measure regional economic development, and the panel data of 32 national key counties for poverty alleviation in Xinjiang and the remaining 48 counties in the province under its jurisdiction are analyzed by using the dual difference method to evaluate the promotion effect of poverty alleviation policies on regional economic development. The indirect impact of different poverty alleviation measures on economic development is explored by using the intermediary effect model. The study found that the implementation of the policy significantly promoted the development of the county economy, and the poverty alleviation policy in minority counties in the region had a stronger role in promoting the economy than that in nonminority counties. Further analysis of the mechanism shows that industrial poverty alleviation and education poverty alleviation have a significant role in county economic development, and the promotion of education poverty alleviation is lower than that of industry poverty alleviation.

TI A Framework of Development-Oriented Poverty Alleviation Implementation
   Projects in Rural China: The Case of Jinggu County
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Although the literature concerning poverty is rich in theory and policy suggestion, the implementation of poverty alleviation is still poorly studied. This study aims to answer the question of what could be considered a good framework for poverty alleviation and how to implement it in rural areas. Based on China's experience, we here conceptualize an implementation framework and process by using a systemic approach. A five-year case study of over fourteen thousand poor households is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and process. The case study results show that poverty alleviation measures have been successfully implemented following the framework and process, and the absolute poverty is eliminated. Key characteristics of China's poverty alleviation program, such as people-centered philosophy, pro-poor development, functional institution, systematic anti-poverty measures, and social mobilization may be useful for other poverty alleviation implementation approaches. The novel implementation framework and process, and propoor development strategy in this study can provide valuable experience for other poverty alleviation programs, and more similar poverty alleviation programs would make a significant contribution to the shared Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Space-time variability analysis of poverty alleviation performance in
   China's poverty-stricken areas
SO SPATIAL STATISTICS
AB China has achieved significant achievements in poverty reduction since the launch of its reform and opening policy in 1978. The rural poor population decreased by nearly 67 million from 2010 to 2012. Analysing and understanding the spatio-temporal variation of poverty alleviation performance in contiguous poverty-stricken regions can provide a reference for Chinese policymakers. In this paper, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we build an evaluation index system of poverty alleviation performance and then establish a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to explore the space-time variability of poverty alleviation performance in poor areas. The spatial distribution indicates the eastern region's higher performance in poverty alleviation compared to the western region. The spatial-temporal feature shows that the increasing trend of poverty alleviation performance presents a pattern of "high in the central, low in the east-west'' and most poor counties' development of poverty alleviation performance are consistent with overall trend. These findings suggest that the government could pay more attention to the development in the western region and vigorously carry out precise poverty alleviation measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SO ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB This study examines how poverty reduction has been associated with economic growth and inequality in Vietnam. It finds that although the speed of poverty reduction was lower in the 2000s than in the 1990s, economic growth was more pro-poor in the latter period. During the 1993-98 period, expenditure inequality increased and the poverty reduction during this period was mainly caused by economic growth. During the 2004-08 period, however, expenditure inequality decreased, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. The poverty incidence declined by around 5 percentage points, of which expenditure growth and redistribution contributed 2.8 and 2.2 percentage points of poverty reduction, respectively.

This paper analyzed the development of circulation industry in western China and the mechanism of circulation industry and targeted poverty alleviation. And it concluded that to solve the problem of overall poverty in the areas, we must optimize the supply chain of agricultural products, make the channels of rural circulation unimpeded, and cultivate compound logistics talents and implement the strategy of combining electric merchants with the implementation of the new poverty alleviation model of "Internet + logistics + poverty alleviation". We can improve the poverty alleviation in the western rural areas through the optimization of the circulation system.

Using a large sample of Chinese prefecture-level cities for the 2003-2013 period, we provide evidence that HSR has a positive effect on rural poverty alleviation. This finding is robust to a battery of robustness tests. In addition, we find that HSR can reduce rural poverty by improving employment rates in the manufacturing and construction industries. Our study suggests that HSR can play an important role in rural poverty alleviation.

TI Reducing child poverty by promoting child well-being: Identifying best
   practices in a time of great need
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Child poverty in the United States persists despite a range of social services designed to reduce poverty rates and improve the economic self-sufficiency of families. The economic downturns resulting in job losses and the housing crisis have converged to create a new group of families who were managing to remain out of poverty prior to the recession but are now slipping into poverty, putting additional strain on services. In light of these pressing issues, this article synthesizes the literature examining child poverty to take a long-range view of the relationship between economic strain, system involvement, and impacts on children and the systems attempting to serve these children. The effectiveness of various policy and program efforts aimed at reducing child poverty rates and/or ameliorating the negative effects of living in poverty is reviewed. The article concludes by suggesting a major shift in focus from reducing child poverty as a singular goal to a comprehensive approach to promoting child and family well-being. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in order to give full play to the role of market entity, poverty alleviation should be combined with natural environment, resources and characteristics, to build a stronger power and incentives mechanism, and more scientific linking mechanism of interests, to play the positive role of market in the allocation of poverty alleviation resources.

TI TACKLING CHILD POVERTY LOCALLY: PRINCIPLES, PRIORITIES AND
   PRACTICALITIES IN CHALLENGING TIMES
SO SCOTTISH AFFAIRS
AB The 2010 Child Poverty Act placed new obligations to address child poverty upon each of the national governments in Britain and all of the local authorities in England and Wales. Local authorities in Scotland do not have the same legal requirement to tackle child poverty, but it is evident that their actions, in conjunction with local partners within the context of Community Planning Partnerships, will be critical to the success of the Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland introduced by the Scottish Government in 2011. At the present time, local interventions to tackle child poverty must be enacted under particularly challenging conditions, as measures to reduce child poverty are undermined by a prolonged economic recession, fiscal austerity, reductions in UK welfare spending, and welfare reforms introduced by the UK government which appear likely to increase the number of households and children experiencing poverty. This paper examines what measures Scottish local authorities, Community Planning Partnerships and other local bodies could take to address child poverty at the local level and meet the national commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.

TI Are Developing Countries Using Climate Funds for Poverty Alleviation?
   Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB This study seeks to analyse whether countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are using climate finance for poverty alleviation. It investigates SSA's readiness to apply climate finance to achieve poverty alleviation goals. Data for 44 SSA countries over the period 2006-2017 were employed and analysed, using System Generalized Method of Moment. Two poverty alleviation variables are employed; GDP per capita and social inequality. Readiness was segregated into social, economic and governance readiness. The findings show that climate finance helps poverty alleviation. However, climate finance indicated a worsening effect on social inequality when countries strengthen regulatory quality and control of corruption. The study finds evidence to support that economic readiness is relatively important in eradicating poverty compared with social and governance readiness. It is recommended that climate funds should be disbursed through channels (social and governance readiness), which would yield more poverty-reduction effects, under greater supervision.

TI Investigating the Relationship Between Local Business and Employment
   Creation for Poverty Reduction in Northern Ghana: The Moderating Role of
   Local Economic Development (LED) Policy
SO SAGE OPEN
AB In the past few decades, the local economic development (LED) policy has gained prominence in Ghana as an effective bottom-up approach for poverty reduction and rural development. Adopting this bottom-up approach to reducing poverty, this paper investigates the impact of local business and local employment creation on poverty reduction in Ghana by employing the moderating role of LED policy. Data were obtained through an online survey platform from 357 respondents from local government officials working within the various districts across the northern parts of Ghana. The study used structural equation model analytical tool to examine the relationships between the variables. The findings affirmed both local business and local employment creation as positive determinants of poverty reduction. Also, employing LED policy as a moderator, local business creation plays the most significant role in reducing poverty at a 1 % significant level. However, the moderating role of LED policy between local employment and poverty reduction was insignificant. Also, local employment insignificantly mediated local business and poverty reduction. Therefore, there is a need for development actors at local and international levels to collectively make a continuous effort to drive the local economic development policy agenda. This can be done through the promotion of local businesses creation to improve standards of living and reduce poverty to the lowest level in Ghana and other developing countries at large.

This paper measures the impact of economic growth on income inequality and poverty alleviation, namely whether income inequality becomes trade-off for poverty alleviation in 35 Central Java regencies. The paper uses fixed effect model by weighting cross section weights. The results show that economic growth increases income inequality. Furthermore, economic growth alleviates poverty and increases income inequality, but the effect is smaller than the reduction in poverty. Therefore, the increased income inequality is not a trade off to poverty alleviation and the economic growth is effective to alleviate poverty.

TI Financial inclusion and multidimensional child poverty
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB Despite the concerted efforts being made at the global, regional, and national levels to reduce child poverty, children in resource-poor countries continue to experience deprivations in multidimensional forms. This study examines the link between parental financial inclusion and multidimensional child poverty using a nationally representative living standards data from Ghana-a nation with documentative evidence of high incidence of multidimensional child poverty. Employing different variants of the propensity score matching technique and multidimensional constructs of financial inclusion and child poverty, our overall finding indicates that financial inclusion decreases multidimensional child poverty. This outcome is consistent across different cut-offs used in measuring multidimensional child poverty and alternative propensity score matching methods. We also find that financial inclusion reduces child poverty more for male and rural-located children. Relatively, financial inclusion has the biggest effect in reducing children's deprivations in living conditions, followed by their health- and education-related deprivations respectively. Household income per capita and durable asset accumulation serve as potential pathways through which financial inclusion transmits to multidimensional child poverty.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
AB Entrepreneurship is widely argued to be critical for alleviating extreme poverty. However, research on this topic is characterized by diverging perspectives regarding poverty alleviation and remains fragmented across various research domains. This review examines 77 leading academic journals over the period 1990 to 2017 and identifies over 200 articles on entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. The analysis of these articles highlights three different underlying perspectives: poverty alleviation through entrepreneurship as remediation (actions that address immediate resource concerns), reform (actions leading to substantive institutional changes), and revolution (actions that change the underlying capitalist-based assumptions of business). The analysis of these articles leads to the development of extensive new insights and opportunities for future research.

AB Since the issuance of the "implementation opinions on targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation for three years" by Guangdong provincial party committee in 2016, Guangdong has achieved remarkable results in targeted poverty alleviation, among which policy-oriented agricultural insurance has played an important role. This paper establishes an evaluation index of agricultural insurance poverty alleviation efficiency from the perspective of input and output, collecting data of 14 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong province from 2013 to 2016, and uses DEA model to comprehensively evaluate the agricultural insurance poverty alleviation efficiency of each city. On this basis, Tobit model was carried out to further explore its influencing factors. The results of this research show that the efficiency of agricultural insurance poverty alleviation in Guangdong province is generally low and regional differences are obvious. Low efficiency cities concentrate in the northward and present scale state of diminishing returns, the government financial subsidies and farmers' payment present the obvious negative correlation to the value of efficiency, it means that higher rates of subsidy lead to the low poverty alleviation efficiency, the possible reason is that subsidies have been waste and result in inefficient subsidies. In the end, the research will give some suggestions to improve the efficiency.

TI Does foreign aid reduce poverty? A dynamic panel data analysis for
   sub-Saharan African countries
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY
AB This study examines the effect of foreign aid on extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the period 1981-2013. The study uses recent dynamic panel estimation techniques, including those methods which deal with endogeneity by controlling for simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The main findings of the study are summarized as follows: firstly, foreign aid does have a statistically significant poverty reduction effect in SSA. Secondly, the disaggregation of aid by source and type shows that total ODA, grants and multilateral aid have poverty reduction effects. Thirdly, democracy enhances the effectiveness of foreign aid in reducing poverty. Lastly, GDP per capita and globalization reduce extreme poverty, while inequality has a detrimental effect on the fight against poverty. This study confirms that the volume of aid matters as well as how it is allocated. The policy implications of these findings are that development partners should continue to focus on poverty reduction as the main objective for ODA. Further, aid allocation should be focused on channels which have more poverty-reduction effects, such as GDP per capita and democracy. Finally, aid recipient countries should come-up with income distributional policies that allow the benefits of growth to accrue to many people, thereby lifting the majority out of extreme poverty.

SO ECONOMIES
AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, all regions in Indonesia have had negative economic growth. It also increased the poverty rate in the country. The government must allocate pro-growth and poverty reduction programs to maintain economic growth and simultaneously reduce poverty. This study aims to measure the relative efficiency of pro-growth poverty reduction spending of local governments in seven regions in Indonesia. This study compares the efficiency scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2015 to 2019 and 2020. The inputs are five types of government spending: education, health, economic, social protection, and infrastructure. The outputs are economic growth and poverty reduction. Data envelopment analysis with an output-oriented model and a return to scale variable approach is applied. The results show that the highest average local government efficiency score was in Kalimantan, with the lowest being in Sulawesi. The efficiency scores of local governments in the COVID-19 pandemic differ between regions: it remained stable in Kalimantan, increased in Java-Bali, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, and experienced a decline in Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Papua. The study concludes that economic growth and poverty reduction can simultaneously measure government efficiency. To be relatively efficient, local governments need to consider allocating pro-growth poverty reduction spending to improve the conditions of both outputs.

TI Do the poor benefit from globalization regardless of institutional
   quality?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Despite significant progress towards the Millennium goals, more than one billion people live on less than 1.25 US dollars per day. Previous research suggests that globalization stimulates poverty reduction, but does not investigate what role institutions play in this relationship. Theoretically, globalization could act as either a complement or a substitute to institutional quality in reducing poverty. We find that the poverty-reducing effect of globalization is stronger when institutions are weak. In particular, increasing social globalization reduces poverty more when corruption is high and democratic accountability is low. Thus, globalization has the power to reduce poverty even in countries with low institutional quality.

TI The Role of Income Inequality for Poverty Reduction
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This paper approximates the identity that links growth in mean incomes and changes in the distribution of relative incomes to reductions in absolute poverty and examines the role of income inequality for poverty reduction. Under the assumption that income is log-normally distributed, we show that we can approximate this identity well. We find that the inequality elasticity of poverty reduction is larger, on average, compared to the growth elasticity of poverty reduction and that the growth elasticity declines steeply with a country's initial level of inequality. However, we find that prior changes in poverty were, in large part, explained by changes in mean incomes. This is a consequence of changes in income inequality being an order of magnitude smaller than changes in mean incomes. Overall, our results highlight the important role income inequality can play in reducing poverty despite prior poverty changes being, in large part, a consequence of economic growth.

TI POVERTY REDUCTION EFFECT OF INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE EQUILIBRIUM BASED ON
   THE MODELS OF MEDIATING EFFECT AND PANEL THRESHOLD
SO JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR AND CONVEX ANALYSIS
AB Of late, China is constantly adjusting and optimizing its indus-trial structure, which has resulted in significant impact on economic growth and poverty alleviation. At the same time, there are wide differences in the degree of industrial structure optimization and poverty alleviation among the provinces in China. An attempt is made to evaluate the mechanism of industrial structure equilibrium on poverty alleviation based on the construction of industrial struc-ture equilibrium index from the perspective of industrial structure equilibrium. The provincial panel data from 2010 to 2018 are collected, and the mediating ef-fect model and the panel threshold model are used to study the problem. While the industrial structure equilibrium has a direct effect on poverty reduction, it also has a mediating effect on the poverty alleviation by promoting the economic development and restraining the income gap between urban and rural areas. Fur-ther analysis shows that the continuous equilibrium of industrial structure has a nonlinear threshold effect on poverty alleviation. When the optimization level of industrial structure constantly crosses the threshold, the elasticity of poverty alleviation on economic development level and the urban-rural income gap grad-ually increases which also explains why provinces with more balanced industrial structure show more significant poverty reduction effects.

AB The problem of poverty alleviation has always been a difficult problem for all countries in the world. China's targeted poverty alleviation has provided new ideas for countries around the world to eliminate poverty. The full participation of financial institutions is an important guarantee for the successful implementation of targeted poverty alleviation. As the battle against poverty enters a decisive stage, the task of financial institutions is further intensified, shifting from supporting poverty-stricken industries to supporting the development of poor households. This transformation has brought many difficulties for financial institutions to participate in targeted poverty alleviation. In this paper, according to the investigation of T county, we summarized the current difficulties of the financial institutions involved in precise poverty alleviation, then make the corresponding countermeasures and Suggestions, for government agencies and financial institutions for reference in the after work.

TI Has Chinese Certified Emission Reduction trading reduced rural poverty
   in China?
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB Consolidating and expanding poverty alleviation while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions has become one of the main issues facing China. The Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) trading programme is an important supplementary mechanism to China's carbon trading market. Based on the data of 1782 counties in China from 2006 to 2017 and a difference-in-differences model, this study investigates the rural poverty reduction effect of CCER trading. We find that: (1) during the sample period, CCER trading has increased the per capita net income of rural residents by at least 2.5% or 187.5 RMB (about 27.8 USD or 39.3 AUD) per year. (2) The poverty reduction effect of CCER trading in poor counties is greater than that in nonpoor counties. (3) Some relevant heterogeneous effects are also measured. We find that CCER trading of hydropower projects has played a significant poverty reduction effect; the poverty reduction effect is further enhanced when the county has additional CCER projects; we also identify regional differences with CCER trading having a greater poverty reduction effect in the western and central regions. (4) Compared with the implementation of the CCER project, trading the emission reductions generated by the CCER project has brought more significant poverty reduction effects.

TI Deep and Extreme Child Poverty in Rich and Poor Nations: Lessons from
   Atkinson for the Fight Against Child Poverty
SO ITALIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB The paper documents child poverty levels and trends using both relative ('deep') and absolute ('extreme') measures in two clusters: Anglo-Saxon high-income countries and upper middle-income countries. We also investigate the influence of different components of household income and other resources on child deep-poverty rates to examine the role of the market and the redistributive effects that materialize through private transfers, public benefits, and tax systems on generating poverty reduction. Overall, middle-income nations have witnessed continuous reductions in their extreme child poverty rates, while mild decreases or fluctuations have been observed in the five high-income nations, with the US highlighted by its relatively high rates of deep and extreme poverty regardless of absolute or relative measures and type of equivalence scale used. Private institutions play a larger role in poverty reduction in middle-income nations compared to its impact on developed nations. The degree of dependence on universal or assistance benefits varies among high-income nation. In the US, universal programs tend to be meager, while Australian social insurance and universal benefit are robust in their fight against deep poverty. Brazil stands out by its overwhelmingly large proportion of social insurance programs that contribute to improvements of its deep child poverty situation, and South Africa's assistance benefit system performs better in lifting children out of deep poverty.

CY MAY 25-26, 2001
CL HELSINKI, FINLAND
AB In the late 1990s the bilateral and multilateral development agencies placed increasing emphasis on poverty reduction in developing countries. This led to the establishment by the United Nations of the 'International Development Targets' for poverty reduction. The target of poverty reduction might be achieved through faster economic growth alone, through redistribution, or through a combination of the two. This article presents an analytical framework to assess the effectiveness of growth and redistribution for poverty reduction. It concludes that redistribution, either of current income or the growth increment of income, is more effective in reducing poverty for a majority of countries than growth alone.

SO DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
AB An important aspect of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to which Vietnam is committed is to reduce overall and food poverty. Although Vietnam has achieved remarkable reductions in poverty during recent years, Vietnam may not achieve its MDGs on poverty reduction because of high inflation and economic stagnation. This paper uses three recent Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSSs), in 2002, 2004, and 2006, to forecast poverty in 2008 and 2010 to examine whether Vietnam can achieve its MDGs on poverty reduction. The forecast takes into account high inflation in 2008 and economic stagnation during 2008-09. It is found that Vietnam may be able to achieve its MDGs on reduction of overall poverty; however, the MDGs on food poverty reduction may not be achieved.

TI Parliament and the politics of poverty reduction in Uganda: a critical
   appraisal
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AB The role of African legislatures in poverty reduction has been widely debated since the 1990s. In this essay, I argue that a poverty reduction strategy that is alien and mute to a human rights-based approach is suspect. Focusing on the case of Uganda, the paper examines the construction of the poverty reduction agenda in the country as encapsulated in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan ( PEAP). There is evidence to show that the PEAP has lacked a rights-based backbone and that the Ugandan parliament has played only a marginal role in poverty reduction policies. The parliament has largely rubberstamped the objectives of the executive branch of guaranteeing and creating a conducive environment for the imperialist neoliberal agenda for the flourishing of global capitalism. Until the hidden hand of imperialism is dealt with, the role of legislatures in actively influencing poverty reduction strategies in Africa will remain a mirage.

TI Impact of protected areas on poverty, extreme poverty, and inequality in
   Nepal
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Protected areas (PAs) are key for biodiversity conservation, but there are concerns that they can exacerbate poverty or unequal access to potential benefits, such as those arising from tourism. We assess how Nepalese PAs influence poverty, extreme poverty, and inequality using a multidimensional poverty index, and a quasi-experimental design that controls for potential confounding factors in non-random treatment allocation. We specifically investigate the role of tourism in contributing to PA impacts. Nepali PAs reduced overall poverty and extreme poverty, and crucially, did not exacerbate inequality. Benefits occurred in lowland and highland regions, and were often greater when a larger proportion of the area was protected. Spread of benefits to nearby areas outside PAs was negligible. Furthermore, older PAs performed better than more recently established ones, suggesting the existence of time lags. Although tourism was a key driver of poverty alleviation, PAs also reduced extreme poverty in areas with fewer tourists.

TI Evaluation of China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policies: A
   Decomposition Analysis Based on the Poverty Reduction Effects
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB To achieve comprehensive poverty alleviation and the establishment of a "moderately prosperous society " in China, it is crucial to evaluate the targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) policies. In this study, China's poverty alleviation statistics and the Foster-Greene-Thorbecke (FGT) indices are used to measure the poverty reduction effects of the TPA policies. A panel regression model is applied to analyze the poverty reduction mechanism while the Shapley index decomposition method is used to analyze poverty reduction effects in terms of income growth and the income gap adjustment. The paper concludes that the poverty breadth index (H index), poverty depth index (PG index), and poverty intensity index (SPG index) from 2013 to 2019 show a significant decline overall. This indicates that the poverty reduction effect of the TPA policies is significant. In addition, the regression analysis shows that the implementation of TPA policies can significantly increase the income level of residents and narrow the income gap among residents in rural areas. Results of the Shapley index decomposition analysis revealed that the income growth effect and income gap adjustment effect accounted for 92.78% and 7.22% of the poverty reduction effects, respectively. So the focus of future poverty alleviation work is to combine the rural revitalization strategy and to continue increasing the income level and the income growth rate of poor groups, which will enhance the ability of impoverished residents to increase their income, further contributing to the alleviation of poverty.

AB China has made great contributions to poverty alleviation and reduction. Since reform and opening up, 250 million people have gotten rid of poverty. As a country with rich experience in poverty alleviation, China should play a greater role in the global poverty elimination. In this paper, the case study approach is applied to research Sudan-China Abuousher Friendship Hospital Project of China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation. The viewpoint put forward in this paper is whether NGO can effectively supplement China's government-led model of global poverty alleviation. Through the successful case of Sudan-China Abuousher Friendship Hospital Project, this paper arrives at the conclusion that China's NGO has advantages of flexibility and continuity in global poverty alleviation while in the meantime faces certain difficulties.

TI The Impact of Foreign Trade and Urbanization on Poverty Reduction:
   Empirical Evidence from China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Poverty eradication is a worldwide development challenge, and China's poverty reduction experience, evident in its sustainable development strategy, is receiving increasing attention. China has achieved high economic growth and success in poverty reduction over the past 40 years, since its reform and opening up. China's experience can provide lessons for other countries, however, the situation of poverty in China is still severe, and the remaining people experiencing that condition have long been in a state where income poverty, capability poverty, and intergenerational transfer of poverty coexist. This requires systematic poverty reduction in multiple fields such as the following: population, production, consumption, capital, technology, finance and taxation, education, health care and environment. Foreign trade and urbanization are the best ways to implement poverty reduction. Despite the fruitful results of international studies, the impact of foreign trade, urbanization and their synergistic effects on poverty reduction have not been fully considered. Therefore, by selecting, as panel data, the urbanization rate, foreign trade dependence, and multiple dimensions of poverty indicators of different provinces in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper establishes regression models to study the poverty reduction effects of urban and rural areas. This is accomplished by focusing on three dimensions: poverty gap; income level and gap; and the numbers of under-insurance and guaranteed expenditure, in terms of both imports and exports, respectively. The paper not only considers the synergistic effects of foreign trade and urbanization on poverty reduction, but also investigates the heterogeneity of poverty reduction effects between urban and rural areas. The research results can be applied not only to poverty reduction policy formulation in China, but they can also provide empirical lessons for other developing countries with large urban-rural disparities. Therefore, the study has important implications for both poverty reduction theory development and poverty reduction policy formulation.

TI Child poverty in the American states: The impact of welfare reform,
   economics, and demographics
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
AB This article identifies the predictors of child poverty rates at the state level before and after the adoption and implementation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The analysis shows that the most important state-level factors that influence child poverty rates are demographics, the health and viability of the state economy, and often the generosity, inclusiveness, and quality of state welfare programs. States with large numbers of black citizens, and those that score highest on infant mortality, teen births, births to unmarried women, children living with a parent without a high school degree, and children living with a single parent have the highest rates of child poverty. Child poverty rates are lowest in states that suffer less unemployment, and in wealthier states. States that score higher on per capita personal income, tax revenues, and taxable resources have lower child poverty rates. While specific "tough" welfare policies adopted by some states seem to have no impact on child poverty rates, we tested for the first time a sophisticated measure of the overall quality of state welfare programs. The analysis reveals that the global quality of a state's welfare programs is often an independent predictor of child poverty. States with the most generous, inclusive, and supportive welfare programs have done the best job of lowering and containing child poverty.

AB Poverty reduction strategies (PRSs) have proliferated across Canada in recent years at different levels of government. In this article, we address the question of what may reasonably be expected of such strategies, in particular the city of Toronto's PRS, drawing on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper experience in the Global South. We argue that key limitations related to the tight fiscal environment in which these strategies have been implemented, their very heavy weighting on the social sectors, and the fact that they are often simple compilations of existing public programs and policies with minimal prioritisation make it highly unlikely that large-scale reductions in poverty will result. Their most important contribution is political, and their impacts on poverty are likely to be positive but modest.

TI The poverty evolution of typical countries along the Belt and Road and
   implications from China's poverty reduction experiences
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB The world is facing a poverty crisis. Despite the great achievements that have been made in poverty alleviation over the past two decades, the extent of poverty in countries along the Belt and Road is still high. Successful poverty reduction in these countries is crucial to meeting the 2030 SDGs. Improving governance to eradicate poverty is a shortcoming that needs to be addressed urgently in poverty reduction pathways along the Belt and Road. In this study, the Standard Deviational Ellipse method was used to study the spatial trajectory of the poverty gravity center. Results showed that the poverty gravity center moved from east to west by 87.60 km annually, while the poverty population decreased by 1211.14 million along the Belt and Road from 2000 to 2020. In addition, the trajectory of the center has shifted due to the different effects of poverty reduction. Among the countries situated along the Belt and Road, China is the most significant contributor to poverty reduction. Accordingly, this study examined the implications of China's successful poverty reduction strategies in order to understand how other countries can effectively respond to poverty. Ultimately, we propose that sustainable poverty alleviation development strategies should be established with the objectives of promoting social equity and improving the wellbeing of all people.

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY REVIEW
AB This paper has three objectives. The first is to discuss the major issues involved in defining and measuring child poverty. The choices that must be made are clarified, and a set of six principles to serve as a guide for public policy are stated. The second objective is to take stock of child poverty and changes in child poverty in the majority of OECD countries since about 1990 when the Convention on the Rights of the Child came into force. Finally, the third objective is to formulate a number of suggestions for the setting of credible targets for the elimination of child poverty in the rich countries. This involves a method for embodying the ideal of children having priority on social resources into a particular set of child poverty reduction targets, it involves the development of appropriate and timely information sources, and finally it involves the clarification of feasible targets that may vary across the OECD.

SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB This paper analyses the multidimensional child poverty status and its dynamic changes in China from 1989 to 2009 using the China Health and Nutrition survey data. Built on the Alkire-Foster methodology, the adjusted child poverty headcount ratio is calculated which measures not only the traditional headcount ratio of child poverty but also the average deprivation intensity among poor children. The overall poverty rates declined over years from 1989 to 2009 in national wide and among provinces, where the key driver was the reduction of the poverty headcount ratio. With the property of decomposition for the adjusted headcount ratio, this study also examines the provincial and regional contribution to the national poverty reduction. Provinces in the middle region of China received the biggest reduction of child poverty rate, and the regional gap of child poverty has been narrowed down, but more effort of poverty reduction should be made to the poorest provinces and rural areas.

Eight dimensions that are indicative of children's basic rights as ratified in UNCRC (1989) are used to identify poor children, including nutrition, water, sanitation, health, education, information, participation and protection. The empirical results show that the hukou type of the family and parents' work units as the structural risk factors exerted the greatest influences on child poverty in urban China. These structural barriers for realising children's basic rights should be removed in order to achieve the Chinese government political goal of eradicating poverty in China in the next five years before 2020.

TI Understanding the multidimensional poverty in South Asia
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB Special attention needs to be paid to achieve the world's poverty reduction goal by 2030 in less than ten-year time. The paper aims to investigate the multidimensional poverty in South Asia in the period 2003-2019. It constructs the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) by selecting ten indicators in the fields of health, education and living standards. The research results show that the MPI of South Asia decreases in the research period. Poor people in South Asian countries are still facing several forms of deprivation while cooking fuel, sanitation, housing, nutrition and years of schooling are the main restrictive factors to poverty reduction in this region. Pakistan, India and Bangladesh face the worst poverty situation in terms of health, education and living standards. Targeted poverty alleviation and resilient poverty reduction are proposed in the paper to improve the poverty reduction efficiency and individual/regional capacity against risks to avoid returning to poverty.

AB Studies and poverty reduction have been widely applied in many countries in the world, yet poverty remains a social problem faced by all countries. The results of this study are expected to provide bid and models of poverty reduction strategies based on the needs of poor households. This study empirically using a qualitative approach to try to find strategies and models of poverty reduction in accordance with the needs of poor households. Poverty alleviation models are top-down, right, and charity shown to have failed to reduce poverty. This study found that poverty reduction strategies and models should be in accordance with the needs of poor households. Poverty reduction programs cannot be applied to all poor households. These finding discovered that poverty alleviation programs right is appropriate to the needs of poor households. The program is poverty reduction are grouped into two categories, namely poverty alleviation programs for poor household unproductive age and poverty alleviation programs of reproductive age. Poor household productive age are more in need of poverty alleviation programs that are direct, short-term, and charity as aid money and goods, while poor households childbearing age are more in need of poverty alleviation programs that are not direct, long-term, and empower such as job creation through corporate and productive economy through opening access to capital and training. It is concluded that the governments poverty alleviation program during this time failed to cope poverty because it is a direct, short-term, and charity. Poverty alleviation programs that empower poor households is the provision of jobs and develop the creative economy.

TI The nonlinear effect of financial and fiscal policies on poverty

   counties with PSTR models
SO PLOS ONE
AB Using panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) models, this paper studies the effects of financial and fiscal policies on poverty reduction across 382 poverty-stricken counties in China. The findings are that both fiscal and financial policies have a positive influence on poverty reduction, and their relationships are nonlinear. For either a high or low degree of poverty, fiscal policies are effective for poverty reduction, while financial policies have a greater impact on poverty reduction when there is a medium degree of poverty. Therefore, in deciding which policies should be prioritized for reducing poverty, the level of poverty should be taken into account. To be more specific, when a portfolio of poverty-reduction policies is implemented, fiscal policies should be prioritized at the beginning, when the incidence of poverty is high. Then, financial support should come to the forefront as the poverty level drops, and fiscal support should be stepped up when the poverty level continues to drop.

AB Targeted poverty alleviation is the refinement of the poverty alleviation, which generally refers to the anti-poverty measures which are implemented to the objects for the poverty alleviation with the scientific method, in order to improve the effects of poverty alleviation. For now, the root cause of the countryside long-term poverty is the intergenerational transfer, which is also the main factor, restricting the results of targeted poverty alleviation. In the context of the rural family structure, women play special roles in their families, which make them become the main passers of the intergenerational transfer. Due to the low level of education and many other factors, most of the rural women do not have their own jobs. And they also transmit the related factors to their children which lead to their children also in poverty. As a result, the rural women are important objects of targeted poverty alleviation. Current targeted poverty alleviation work should place more attention to these kinds of problems, like how to promote the long-term implementation of poverty alleviation to the rural women and block the intergenerational transfer.

TI Local officials' political capital and poverty alleviation
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES OF ECONOMICS
AB This study examined the effect of local officials' political capital on poverty alleviation by using a manually compiled database of county party secretaries (CPSs) in impoverished counties in China. The empirical results reveal that CPSs with political capital positively affect poverty alleviation. Mechanism tests indicated that CPSs with political capital contribute to greater agricultural and financial development, attract more enterprise investment, and increase fiscal expenditure. The promotional effect of local officials' political capital on poverty alleviation was influenced by CPSs' characteristics (e.g., tenure, education level, and age) and was less pronounced during central government inspection and when the provincial government was less concerned about local officials' poverty alleviation. Our results suggest that local officials' political capital can alleviate poverty in emerging economies.

TI The Role of Forestry-Based Policies in Alleviating Relative Poverty in
   the Rocky Desertification Area in Southwest China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB China has put forward a series of forestry-based poverty alleviation policies, aiming to alleviate poverty and improve the livelihoods of rural households, especially in backward and ecologically fragile areas with rich forest resources. Based on field survey data, we used an empirical analysis method to investigate the role of forestry-based policies in alleviating the relative poverty of rural households in the rocky desertification area in southwest China. The Logit regression results demonstrate that forestry-based poverty alleviation policies are significant at alleviating the relative poverty of rural households, and there are differences in the degree and significance of the impact of various forestry-based poverty alleviation policies. In particular, the forestry industry support (FIS) policy, the ecological forest rangers (EFRs) policy, and the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) can significantly decrease the incidence of relative poverty of rural households, while the effect of the Public Benefit Forest Compensation Program (PBFC) on decreasing the incidence of relative poverty is not significant. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role and effectiveness of China's forestry-based poverty alleviation policies, and can provide a reference for optimizing the forestry poverty alleviation policies for the specific area and even the whole nation, as well as provide experience for worldwide poverty alleviation by forestry.

TI Empirical evidence of child poverty and deprivation in Nigeria
SO CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB Development economists and policy makers have in recent times focused attention on child poverty as a crucial aspect of poverty. The importance of the analysis of child poverty partly lies in the fact that children are the most vulnerable group in every society. This study used two poverty lines and the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index to analyze extreme and overall child poverty headcount, depth and severity in Nigeria. The study also used the headcount ratio to analyze the extent of child deprivation in education, health, nutrition, child protection, water and sanitation. The study was based on the 2010 Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) and the 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Abuja, Nigeria. The study revealed that 23.22% of children in Nigeria were in extreme child poverty while 70.31% of children in the country were in overall child poverty. The study further showed that there was pronounced child deprivation in education, health, nutrition, child protection, water and sanitation. Both child poverty and child deprivation were more pronounced in the rural sector than in the urban sector and in Northern Nigeria than in Southern Nigeria. Therefore, the Nigerian government should take adequate steps to eradicate child poverty and obliterate all forms of child deprivation in Nigeria particularly deprivation in basic needs. In taking such steps, more attention should be focused on rural areas and Northern Nigeria.

TI FDI inflows and poverty reduction in Botswana: an empirical
   investigation
SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB This study investigates the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows on poverty reduction in Botswana from 1980 to 2014. The main objective of this study is to establish whether FDI plays a positive role in poverty reduction. The study employs autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to co-integration and the error correction model to investigate the relationship. To ensure robustness, the study uses three poverty reduction proxies which are household consumption expenditure (Pov1), infant mortality rate (Pov2), and life expectancy (Pov3). The findings from this study revealed that FDI has a positive impact on poverty reduction in the short run and a negative impact in the long run when life expectancy is used as a poverty reduction measure. When infant mortality rate is used as a poverty reduction proxy, an insignificant relationship is registered in both the long run and the short run. A negative impact of FDI on poverty reduction is confirmed in the short run when household consumption expenditure is used as a poverty reduction proxy, while in the long run an insignificant relationship is reported. The study concludes that the impact of FDI on poverty reduction is sensitive to the poverty reduction proxy used.

TI Multidimensional Child Poverty in Ghana: Measurements, Determinants, and
   Inequalities
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Early childhood deprivations and inequalities have social and economic implications in adulthood and thus, their elimination is essential for child development. However, child-level estimates of poverty are rare in low income countries. Using data from two recent rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we measure the extent and sources of childhood deprivations in Ghana and examine subgroup differentials in child poverty. In addition, we examine the child quality-quantity by estimating the causal relationship between number of children and child poverty. Finally, we assess the sources of rural-urban inequalities in child poverty. We find that despite declining incidence and intensity of multidimensional child poverty, significant subgroup differentials persist in Ghana. The findings of the paper reveal that living standards is the main contributor to multidimensional poverty in early childhood in Ghana. Our findings also confirm a significant causal relationship between child quality and quantity in Ghana, there exist a positive relationship between the number of children and the intensity of child poverty in Ghana. Finally, we find that rural-urban inequalities in child multidimensional poverty in Ghana are attributable to differences in observed maternal and household characteristics between rural and urban areas. The persistence of subgroup disparities in child poverty may be detrimental to achieving equitable and inclusive growth in the country. There is the need for considerations of equity, fairness and social justice in the distribution and development of social services and economic infrastructure to ensure even distribution of social and economic opportunities and promote social mobility across groups.

The countries compared are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), representing countries with different child maintenance schemes. Results show that the contribution that child maintenance makes in reducing overall child poverty is modest However, it has a relatively large impact in reducing child poverty for those who do receive it. Child maintenance reduces the income poverty gap to the greatest extent in the UK and lifts most poor children out of poverty in Denmark and Sweden.

TI Poverty Reduction in China: Does the Agricultural Products Circulation
   Infrastructure Matter in Rural and Urban Areas?
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Since the reform and opening-up in 1978, a remarkable achievement has been made in poverty reduction in China. Many previous studies have analyzed the poverty reduction effects of economic growth, fiscal expenditure, education levels, information technology, urbanization, foreign trade, industrial development and other factors. As a bridge between production and consumption, the agricultural products circulation industry has an important role on the income growth of rural residents. However, the construction level of China's agricultural products circulation infrastructure lags behind, resulting in a decline in the efficiency and quality of agricultural products supply, and farmers are also facing the embarrassing situation of increasing production without increasing income. Therefore, in this study, we selected the China's provincial panel data from 2003 to 2017 to analyze the effect of agricultural products distribution infrastructure in narrowing the income gap between urban and rural residents and poverty reduction in China. First, we review the extant literature and elaborate the poverty reduction path of agricultural products circulation industry; secondly, we build models step by step and select nine variables; lastly, we carry out regression analysis on the overall poverty reduction effect of China's agricultural products circulation industry, the poverty reduction effect of internal factors of agricultural products circulation industry and regional spatial heterogeneity with Stata software. Our results showed that the development level of the agricultural products circulation industry and the degree of opening-up have significant positive effects on narrowing the income gap between urban and rural residents and poverty reduction varied, with different regions in China. Among all the internal factors of development of agricultural products circulation industry in poverty reduction, the core explanatory variable is the investment in agricultural products circulation infrastructure with the largest poverty reduction effect, followed by the human capital, informatization level and number of employees of the agricultural products circulation industry, and the poverty reduction effects of the four internal development factors have had significant regional differences in China. Our findings further complement the internal mechanism of agricultural product circulation infrastructure on poverty reduction in China, suggest that we should apply appropriate strategies and give priority to the internal development factor of the agricultural product circulation industry, with the largest poverty reduction effect according to local conditions in different regions, and so be better able to achieve the targeted poverty alleviation and offer insights for the rural poverty reduction in other countries, especially in the developing countries.

TI Spatial differentiation and factors influencing the benefits of
   industrial poverty alleviation in villages
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB Industrial poverty alleviation is one of the most important aspects of targeted poverty alleviation. Identifying the mechanism influencing the spatial differentiation of the benefits of industrial poverty alleviation plays an essential role in optimising an industrial layout for poverty alleviation, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and revitalising rural industries. This study examined the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of the benefits of industrial poverty alleviation at the village level using the household data collected from Jiangjin District, Chongqing, China. The results show that the benefits of industrial poverty alleviation presented obvious spatial differentiation in the villages with the overall performance being high in the north and low in the south and decreasing from the south of the county to the north and south. Spatially, there was a significant positively correlated agglomeration effect. High-value agglomeration areas were concentrated in the north with the characteristics of 'one centre and two subcentres'. However, low-value and outlier agglomeration effects were not obvious, presenting sporadic distribution. Seven major factors affect industrial poverty alleviation in Jiangjin District, including average altitude and land transfer rate. The interaction between any two of the seven factors has a more significant impact than that of a single factor.

SO REVISTA CIDOB D AFERS INTERNATIONALS
AB The aim of this article is to summarise certain positive results achieved by the Lula government in the sphere of social policy and to highlight the new challenges taken on by President Dilma Rousseff in terms of eradicating extreme poverty, after her first year in government. After Lula's success with social policy, Rousseff has committed herself to eradicating extreme poverty over the short term (the four years of her mandate) in a federation that is marked by weak links in cooperation, a distinct heterogeneity within the federated bodies and profound socio-economic inequality among citizens. Under Lula's government, the factors that most helped to reduce poverty and inequality were the recovery of the minimum salary's real value in rates higher than that of inflation, as well as an increase in formal employment, with the creation of approximately 12,000,000 jobs in eight years. For Dilma's term of office, which began with a downturn in economic growth rates, an even bigger challenge lies ahead. In light of this, the article evaluates the prospects for success of Dilma's government in terms of eradicating extreme poverty in Brazil.

TI Does the synergy among agriculture, industry, and the service industry
   alleviate rural poverty? Evidence from China
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper provides empirical evidence that strengthening the synergy among agriculture, industry, and the service industry is an effective rural poverty reduction strategy. Using China's provincial panel data from 2010 to 2019, we employ a coupling model to measure this synergy and to apply an empirical analysis methodology to examine its impact on rural poverty. The results indicate that the synergy among agriculture, industry, and the service industry results in a significant decrease in rural poverty. The poverty reduction effect is greatest in western China. The growth of the rural economy and the increase in rural households' business income are the main channels by which synergy plays its role in reducing poverty.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE POOR AND UNDERSERVED
AB Objective. To evaluate effects of the medical home on health status and health care use among children living in poverty compared with children not living in poverty. Methods. Data from the 2016- 2017 National Survey of Children's Health were used to examine the associations of having a medical home with health outcomes of interest, among children living in poverty and among children not living in poverty. Results. Among 69,039 children ages 0- 17 years, children living in poverty had lower medical home access (31%) compared with those not living in poverty (50%). Medical home access was favorably associated with health outcomes, but the strength of these association did not vary according to poverty status. Conclusions. Notwithstanding the efficacy of the medical home at promoting child health, children living in poverty did not have greater health benefits associated with medical home access compared with children not living in poverty.

AB This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on poverty reduction strategy execution, with a view to extending understanding of the failure of poverty reduction strategy execution particular in the republic of Chad. The review leads to the following broad conclusions; there are convincing arguments that lack of strong leadership, poor roads and infrastructure, lack of training programs for teachers. Besides, poor financial resources are the main causes of the poverty reduction strategy implementation failures. Likewise, other causes of failure are due to the lack the appropriate technology, equipment, updated skills, modern technology, capacity building, innovative techniques, and, lack of capital to invest in agriculture sector in the rural areas. The paper argues that these conclusions provide a strong justification for the failure of poverty reduction strategy execution. Therefore, the paper also highlights several areas where more research is urgently needed, in particular how to overcome the poverty reduction strategy implementation challenges.

TI Poverty reduction through enabling factors
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors which are instrumental to poverty reduction opposed to many factors that are considered as impediments to poverty reduction in a poor country like Bangladesh.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is an outcome of review of literature covered wide range of issues including sectoral contribution to economic growth but none has exclusively dealt with the instrumental role of the poverty reduction factors, insider's view, long-term observations (1960-2014), and reviews of secondary data.
   Findings - In order to reduce poverty, rather than attempting to change the "culture of poverty," remove the "structural trap," or "kin system as poverty trap" it can be achieved through harnessing the enabling factors of poverty reduction. Study argues that rather than focusing on "barriers" to poverty reduction, a country needs to identify and focus on its "potential" factors of poverty reduction. The dominant enabling factors for Bangladesh were agricultural development and remittance. The utilization of land and labor could bring a transformation in the rural economy of Bangladesh which was essential to poverty reduction.
   Practical implications - The study shows that the individuals can escape poverty largely through their own effort where a proper policy support from the government is needed. The state needs to play the facilitating role rather than the instrumental in the case of poverty reduction.
   Originality/value - The paper reveals instruments to poverty reduction where usual practice was to identify the barrier to development and to suggest the means of overcoming those barriers. It suggests how to look into the matter from other way round where instead of identifying the barrier attempt should be made to identify the enabling factors and to harness those enabling factors. The findings are based on the country-specific literatures but not generalized in the form as attempted here. The study shows a means of poverty reduction where country-specific strategy or home-grown model can be drawn out based on the identification of potential factors.

TI Poverty, extreme poverty and homelessness in Spain: an analysis for the
   period 2010-2019
SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
AB This work adopts different approaches to analyse situations of poverty and extreme poverty in Spain during the last decade, considering different monetary thresholds, measures of severe material deprivation and the combination of both. The determining factors of these situations and the patterns that act as a link between extreme poverty and homelessness are also examined. The results of the study show that for the most restrictive thresholds of 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the median equivalised disposable income the smallest variations during the series are observed, confirming that situations of such deep poverty are not influenced by the cycle since they do not respond to economic stimuli. The determinants of extreme poverty suggest that public policies should be target towards high-risk groups, such as single person households, households with children, younger individuals, individuals with a low educational attainment, and of foreign nationality. Finally, an interesting result is that the profile of individuals in situations of consistent poverty have the greatest similarities to the group of people experiencing homelessness.

According to panel data containing 126 county-level districts of Yunnan Province from 2006 to 2018, assessed the consequence of the poverty alleviation policy in continuous poverty-stricken areas. The combination of the PSM and DID method is pragmatic to right the possible selection partiality as well as resolve the probable endogenic complications, and a series of robustness tests have been carried out to prove the robustness of the research conclusions. The outcomes specify that the policy meaningfully upgraded the GDP thru 11.8% in these areas. Furthermore, the policy endorses economic development through the adjustment of industrial structure, lastly providing three policy suggestions to expand the level and driving force of economic development in impoverished areas.

TI How Do Ecosystem Services Affect Poverty Reduction Efficiency? A Panel
   Data Analysis of State Poverty Counties in China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Scientific evaluation of the interaction between poverty reduction efficiency (PRE) and ecosystem services (ES) in state poverty counties is essential in promoting the rural revitalization strategy and the construction of an ecological civilization. Using the DEA model, the InVEST model, and fixed-effect panel data, this study was analyzed using the panel data of 832 poverty counties in China for 2010-2019 to evaluate the relationship between poverty reduction efficiency and ecosystem services. The main results are as follows: (1) The overall poverty reduction efficiency showed an upward trend, while ES exhibited a declining trend with spatial heterogeneity. The poverty reduction efficiency of state poverty counties in the western region increased rapidly. (2) The impact of different types of ecosystem services on poverty reduction efficiency varied considerably. Habitat quality was significantly negatively impacted, while food production and carbon storage showed significant positive effects. There was a significant positive relationship between ecosystem services and poverty reduction efficiency in all regions, with the eastern region having the strongest correlation. (3) The panel regression analysis showed a significant positive impact. The environmental parameters were the primary factors affecting poverty reduction efficiency, while economic and social factors were the driving and external factors. The rural revitalization strategy should strive towards the win-win effect of ecological protection and economic development.

TI Research on the Operating Mechanism of E-Commerce Poverty Alleviation in
   Agricultural Cooperatives: An Actor Network Theory Perspective
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB E-commerce poverty alleviation has become a new wisdom in China's rural poverty alleviation, but there are a few empirical researches on e-commerce poverty alleviation based on farmer cooperatives. Taking four typical poverty counties in Zhejiang Province as an example, based on the actor network theory (ANT), this paper defines the participants and their obligatory passage point (OPP) from the e-commerce poverty alleviation actor network (EPAAN), combs the roles and interest demands of various stakeholders, and constructs the EPAAN model based on farmer cooperatives according to the translation process. We found that the EPAAN is a heterogeneous network by constantly updating, which consists of human actors with cooperatives as the main body and non-human actors. Moreover, our study illustrates that the formation and operation mechanism of cooperative e-commerce poverty alleviation network alliance under the background of targeted poverty alleviation can be well analyzed with the help of actor network theory. This study contributes to provide a feasible Chinese plan for the cause of poverty eradication all over the world, and provides a great reference value for global poverty governance.

TI Effect of Micro-Credit for Poverty Alleviation on Income Growth and
   Poverty Alleviation-Empirical Evidence from Rural Areas in Hebei, China
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Micro-credit for poverty alleviation is an important financial measure of targeted poverty reduction and rural revitalization in China. This paper employs the OLS model and Logit model to empirically test the effect of micro-credit for poverty alleviation on the income level and stability of income growth of farmers based on the field survey data of 458 registered poverty-stricken farmer households in Fuping County and Quyang County of Hebei Province. The results suggest that micro-credit for poverty alleviation can increase farmers' income, stabilize the growth of their income, and exert significant short-term and long-term effects on income growth and poverty alleviation. The specialized farmer cooperatives, the scale of production and operation, the proportion of family labor force, and the education level of the head of the farmer's household exert a significantly positive effect on the farmers' income and the stable growth of their income. There is a significant interaction between micro-credit for poverty alleviation and specialized farmer cooperatives. The physical conditions of family members exert a negative effect on the stable growth of their income, and other financing channels have no significant effect.

TI Evaluating poverty alleviation strategies in a developing country
SO PLOS ONE
AB A slew of participatory and community-demand-driven approaches have emerged in order to address the multi-dimensional nature of poverty in developing nations. The present study identifies critical factors responsible for poverty alleviation in India with the aid of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) deployed for showcasing causal reasoning. It is through FCM-based simulations that the study evaluates the efficacy of existing poverty alleviation approaches, including community organisation based micro-financing, capability and social security, market-based and good governance. Our findings confirm, to some degree, the complementarity of various approaches to poverty alleviation that need to be implemented simultaneously for a comprehensive poverty alleviation drive. FCM-based simulations underscore the need for applying an integrated and multi-dimensional approach incorporating elements of various approaches for eradicating poverty, which happens to be a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Besides, the study offers policy implications for the design, management, and implementation of poverty eradication programmes. On the methodological front, the study enriches FCM literature in the areas of knowledge capture, sample adequacy, and robustness of the dynamic system model.

TI THE ROLE OF ICT USE IN SMES TOWARDS POVERTY REDUCTION: A SYSTEMATIC
   LITERATURE REVIEW
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The purpose of this study is to review the literature on the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT), small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and poverty reduction. The first dimension looks at the role of ICT use in SMEs. The second dimension investigates how the use of ICTs by SMEs can enable poverty reduction. A systematic literature review methodology is rigorously employed to analyse the literature in order to reach conclusions. In addition, this study meticulously captures some important gaps in the current literature and proposes novel future directions of research. This paper concludes that ICTs can be used as a tool for driving socio-economic development, such as poverty reduction, by SMEs. A systematic literature review on the interaction between ICT use by SMEs and poverty reduction, as conducted in this study, has not been undertaken before. This study will benefit scholars, business owners, government and non-government agencies that focus on the development of the SME sector to understand the role of ICT use in SMEs to enable development and poverty reduction.

SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB There is less than a decade left to accomplish the goal of ending global poverty by 2030. This paper investigates global poverty dynamics and finds a shift in the world's poverty gravity center from South Asia to Africa in the period 1990-2015. Sub-Saharan Africa has become the main battlefield for poverty reduction in the world. Global poverty reduction has been accompanied by political instability and local conflicts, economic marginalization, rural decline, and natural hazards as well as climate change which are jointly impacting the least developed areas and making the world's poverty reduction vulnerable to external shocks. The "STAR" scheme, including maintaining political stability, promoting targeted poverty alleviation, implementing regular assessments of poverty reduction initiatives, and revitalizing rural and poverty-stricken areas, is proposed with specific measures to enhance the resilience capacity of poverty alleviation in the world.

SO REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS
AB This paper investigates the impact of foreign capital (foreign direct investment and foreign aid) on poverty reduction and food security in the case of 50 developing countries over the 1995-2015 period. Four types of foreign aids are included in the analysis, namely: social-infrastructure-aid (SIA), investment aid (IA), non-investment-aid (NIA), and agriculture-forestry-fishing-aid (AFFA). The following findings are obtained through the TOBIT estimations: (i) FDI has a positive impact on food security and poverty reduction, (ii) SIA and NIA have positive impacts on poverty reduction; however, the impacts of IA and AFFA on poverty reduction is insignificant, (iii) SIA, IA, and AFFA positively contribute to food security, and (iv) the impacts of FDI and foreign aids on food security and poverty reduction increases when they are working together, i.e., a great collaboration between FDI and aids will be more effective in reducing poverty and assuring food security in developing countries. This complementarity is also confirmed using the system Generalized Method of Moments method. Policy implications and future research directions are also discussed.

TI COVID-19, poverty reduction, and partisanship in Canada and the United
   States
SO POLICY AND SOCIETY
AB Poor people proved especially vulnerable to economic disruption during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which highlighted the importance of poverty reduction as a policy concern. In this article, we explore the politics of poverty reduction during the COVID-19 crisis in Canada and the United States, two liberal welfare-state regimes where poverty reduction is a key policy issue. We show that, since the beginning of the pandemic, policies likely to reduce poverty significantly have been adopted in both Canada and the United States. Yet, this poverty reduction logic has emerged in different ways in the two countries-with the United States embracing more significant departures from its policy status quo. This situation leads us to ask the following question: in each country, what are the political conditions under which public policies susceptible of reducing poverty are enacted? To answer this question, we study the politics of poverty reduction both before and during the pandemic, as we suggest that grasping the evolution of partisan and electoral patterns over time is necessary to explain what happened during the pandemic, whose impact is closely related to how it interacts with such patterns. Our analysis suggests the need to consider more carefully the impact of both crises and partisanship on social policy, including poverty reduction.

TI Economic growth and poverty reduction: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA) countries
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have registered outstanding economic growth in recent decades. However, poverty is still pervasive, deep, and severe in the region. This paper aims to analyze the impact of the recent economic growth on poverty reduction in 27 SSA countries using a new dynamic panel data set. Adopting System GMM estimation, this study found that economic growth has been associated with poverty reduction. Also, the previous level of poverty had an intense impact on the prevalent poverty status in the region. Moreover, although nonmonetary measures and income measures of poverty produce similar results (showing a reduction in poverty), nonincome poverty, especially destitution data, suggest that SSA countries are poorer even than previously understood. We suggest that SSA countries should promote a policy of income-enhancing (i.e., economic growth) to ramp up poverty reduction.

TI Child poverty in Poland
SO POLISH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB This article is about child poverty, one of the characteristic types Of Current poverty in Poland. Child poverty is an inconspicuous social issue and is hard to study, not only in Poland. Child poverty is associated with the risk that poverty will consolidate in future generations and will be "inherited." Child poverty in Poland is most frequently found in numerous families although in some cases (e.g., urban enclaves of poverty) poor children can be found in all types of families. The author draws upon her own research to discuss four dimensions of child poverty: 1) need satisfaction within the family; 2) educational barriers; 3) working children and 4) household responsibilities of children in poor families.

AB Especially in the last decade there is a growing attention devoted to the role of agriculture for poverty reduction and the importance of this sector for poverty alleviation is emphasised. Dealing with this role there are many questions, which bring attention of individual authors. Among the most important belong whether the growth of agriculture is more contributory to poverty reduction than the economic growth of other sectors of economy; what is efficiency of growth of primary, secondary and tertiary sector for poverty alleviation; whether it is better to support agricultural, manufacturing or services sector development to reduce poverty; what is the difference in growth elasticity of poverty reduction depending on initial level of economic development, poverty level and inequality of income distribution; or what is the contribution of agriculture for reducing of income inequality.
   The article is focused on evaluation of different contribution of agriculture, industry and the sector of services for poverty alleviation. Growth elasticity of poverty reduction of these sectors in continental countries of Latin America is calculated. Relatively important factor of the size of this contribution to poverty alleviation, which is also analysed in this article, is structure of domestic economy.

TI The effects of an innovative e-commerce poverty alleviation platform on
   Chinese rural laborer skills development and family well-being
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Since its economic reforms in 1978, China has seen nearly 700 million people lifted out of poverty. Although a great feat, millions of people, concentrated primarily in rural areas of the country, continue to experience extreme poverty. In order to address this issue, the Chinese government announced a strategy, called targeted poverty alleviation, to eliminate poverty by 2020. This strategy calls upon the cooperation of enterprises in this poverty alleviation effort. This study examines the China Philanthropy platform to illustrate how targeted poverty alleviation efforts have led to an innovative and successful e-commerce platform, which has shown positive effects on skills development, income, and resource allocation for workers and their families. The results indicate that this novel platform has strong potential to improve the professional skills of the participants and increase their family incomes. In turn, the families have more income to allocate to the education expenses of their children, an indicator of human capital accumulation. Policy implications are discussed.

AB This paper uses activity theoretic analyses to investigate the role of governments in developing rural e-commerce ecosystems and the effects of such ecosystems on poverty alleviation. On the basis of a case study of Longnan, one of the poorest regions in China, this paper reports and analyses the various actions taken by local governments in nurturing, supporting, and regulating the development of a local rural e-commerce ecosystem and using this ecosystem to transform poverty alleviation. Our study articulates a model of poverty alleviation through e-commerce. By documenting and theorizing the mechanisms underlying rural e-commerce development and poverty alleviation through e-commerce as well as governments' role in developing and sustaining them, this paper contributes to establishing a "theory of the solution" to the grand challenge of poverty alleviation both in China and globally.

TI Evaluation of Poverty Reduction Performance in Turkey After 2002
SO MALIYE DERGISI
AB After 2002, the average monthly household income increased significantly in real terms in Turkey, while the Gini coefficient, decreased 0,06 points and poverty household rate decreased 7,91 percentage points. Mix of growth and income distribution policies in Turkey leads to a faster reduction of absolute poverty. Macroeconomic stability, human capital development, the reduction of regional disparities, and the establishment of an effective social assistance system have been effective in reducing poverty and improving income distribution. The rate of poverty reduction depends on the improvements in income inequality. It depends on the reduction in the Gini coefficient that the growth process will lead to faster reduction in the poverty. With growth targets, determination of income distribution targets in Turkey will improve poverty reduction performance of the country and will cause faster poverty reduction.

SO IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS
AB This paper attempts to discuss the strategic roles of public libraries in Nigeria in poverty alleviation programmes in the 21st century. The various poverty alleviation programmes aimed at combating poverty that have been put in place by the successive Federal Governments of Nigeria are brought to light. Despite the poverty reduction schemes introduced by the successive governments, the soaring rate of poverty in the country is still very alarming. Furthermore, the roles of libraries, particularly, the public libraries, have not been realized in that regard. Within this context, the paper examines the strategic roles of the public libraries in reducing the rate of poverty in the country. It concludes by making some recommendations that can assist the Nigerian public libraries to actively play their deserved roles, and/or participate fully in the poverty reduction programmes.

TI Industrial Poverty Alleviation, Digital Innovation and Regional
   Economically Sustainable Growth: Empirical Evidence Based on Local
   State-Owned Enterprises in China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper takes the industrial poverty alleviation of local state-owned enterprises in China as the research object, and takes the local state-owned enterprises listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen A shares in China from 2016 to 2020 as the sample to empirically test the impact of industrial poverty alleviation on the sustainable economic growth of the region and consider the regulatory effect of digital innovation. This study found that China's local industrial poverty reduction behavior in state-owned enterprises can effectively promote regional economic growth. Moreover, the digital innovation produced a regulating effect; that is, if enterprises carry out digital innovation and have a higher degree of digital innovation, their industrial poverty alleviation behavior will have a stronger role in promoting regional economic growth. This conclusion still holds even after controlling for factors of robustness and endogeneity. In addition, the study of influence mechanisms found that the proportion of primary industry in GDP was the mediating effect of industrial poverty alleviation on regional economic growth, and the proportion of primary industry in GDP had a partial mediating effect. Further heterogeneous group testing shows that the impact of industrial poverty alleviation on regional economically sustainable growth is more obvious in agriculture-related, local state-owned enterprises; non-high-tech, local state-owned enterprises; and local state-owned enterprises with subsequent poverty alleviation plans. The empirical evidence in this paper verifies the role of local state-owned enterprises' participation in industrial poverty alleviation in promoting regional economic growth. It is a useful supplement to the research literature on the economic consequences of Chinese enterprises' participation in targeted poverty alleviation, which helps to better understand such a phenomenon and also provides a powerful explanation for China's poverty alleviation achievements.

AB The coupling and coordinated development of economic poverty alleviation and ecological poverty alleviation is an important strategy for poverty alleviation development in the new era. It is the basis for achieving the goal that all people get rid of poverty in 2020 and entering a well-off society together. Taking concentrated and contiguous poverty-stricken areas in Yunnan Province of China as the target research objective, the Entropy Method is used to evaluate the performance of economic, social, human settlement and ecological poverty alleviation. Then, the coupling harmonious degree model is selected to explore the correlation, consistency and coordination between economic poverty alleviation and ecological poverty alleviation. The results shows that: (1) The overall poverty alleviation performance is at a low-middle level, and the poverty alleviation performance in Tibetan inhabited area is the only one that ranks in the upper middle level, among the four regions of Yunnan. (2) The degree of coupling in Yunnan and the 4 regions is relatively high, basically in a highly coupled stage, but the degree of coupling harmonious is low, especially in the Wumeng Mountainous area. According to the conclusion, it is proposed to promote regional development and the economic and ecological coupling development through the optimization of the utilization and allocation of poverty alleviation resources, the appropriate tilt of poverty alleviation policies to areas with low performance and coupling harmonious, and the enhancement of the value of ecological services in Tibetan inhabited area.

AB Building off the success of the federal earned income tax credit (EITC), states have developed earned income credits to supplement the incomes of the working poor. In 2016, a distinctive change to the Oregon Earned Income Credit (OEIC) targeted additional resources to families with young children. Using a unique data set and static estimates, we found that the OEIC yielded proportional decreases in child and young child poverty of 1.8 and 2.6%, respectively. By simulating alternative OEIC policies, we also found that significant increases to OEIC rates or takeup would be required to more aggressively reduce child poverty.

AB Tourism poverty alleviation has its powerful radiation effect, substantial economic benefits, good ecological environment benefit and social benefit, which has obvious comparison advantages. There are many restrictive factors in the tourism poverty alleviation development process in national poverty areas: the leading role of the government is not clear; the farmers can not share the tourism development result, and the human resource quality in national areas is not high, and the protection for ecological environment and folk culture is not enough. Thus, it puts forward tourism poverty alleviation development strategy in national areas: clearing the leading position of government; coordinating the benefit distribution of tourism enterprises and poverty population; improving the quality of poverty population; enhancing the environmental protection consciousness, protecting ecological environment and folk custom culture and promote sustainable development.
   Due to historical reason, the geographical position of minority areas in China is relatively remote, and the economic development level is lower. However, the national poverty areas normally contain rich tourism resource, long history of ancient culture, special national customs, colorful natural landscape, which provides excellent premise conditions for the tourism industry in the area. Tourism poverty alleviation is used as an innovation poverty alleviation form, which plays an increasing role and opens a brand new channel for poverty alleviation. Tourism poverty alleviation has an important significance for the future development of minority poverty areas and undeveloped areas in China.

TI Child Poverty in New Zealand: Why it matters and how it can be reduced
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB A combination of policy changes and wider socio-economic trends led to a dramatic increase in child poverty in New Zealand during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Higher rates of child poverty have now become embedded in the system and show little sign of resolving themselves. For a country which once took pride in being comparatively egalitarian and, more particularly, a great place to bring up children, the tolerance of much greater child poverty is surprising. It is also concerning. Child poverty imposes many costs. This is especially the case, according to the available evidence, when poverty occurs during early childhood and when it is severe and/or persistent. These costs afflict not only the children directly exposed to poverty (e.g. in the form of lower educational achievement, reduced lifetime earnings and poorer health outcomes), but also the whole society. This article briefly explores the available evidence concerning the nature, magnitude, causes and consequences of child poverty in New Zealand and considers why substantial rates of child poverty have been tolerated for an extended period. Drawing on the lessons of anti-poverty approaches in other OECD countries, it then outlines a strategy for securing substantial and durable reductions in child poverty rates in New Zealand. Finally, it considers the prospects of such a strategy being implemented and suggests ways of enhancing the focus of the political system on child-related social issues.

TI Estimating the Impact of Poverty Alleviation Microcredit on the Income
   of Poor Households Using the Propensity Score Matching Method: Evidence
   from China
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB The poverty alleviation microcredit policy is an important financial poverty alleviation policy that has been widely implemented in China in recent years. However, whether this policy can effectively increase the income of poor households is controversial. In order to measure the implementation effect of the policy, we analyzed the mechanism of the poverty alleviation microcredit on the income of poor households. Then, the paper used micro-survey data to conduct an empirical test using the propensity score matching method to study its effect on the production income of these poor households. The results show that the poverty alleviation microcredit positively affects the production income of poor households, including those who are poor due to lack of funds and poor households with female heads. Therefore, we should continue to implement the poverty alleviation microcredit policy, and establish relevant supporting measures, such as strengthening agricultural production capital subsidies, increasing agricultural production insurance, further improving the implementation efficiency of the poverty alleviation microcredit policy, and increasing the income of poor households.

Taking Sichuan Province as an example, based on the time series data from 1994 to 2014, this paper constructed FGT index, used vector autoregressive model, impulse response and variance decomposition method to quantitatively study the poverty reduction effect of rural microfinance. The results show that: The breadth of poverty, the depth of poverty and the intensity of poverty in the rural areas of Sichuan all have a tendency to expand. The effect of reducing poverty in rural microfinance is small and decreasing; reducing poverty is better than reducing inequality between the number of people living in poverty and income distribution.

TI Does International Investment Help Poverty Reduction in China?
SO CHINESE ECONOMY
AB This study analyzes effects of international investment on poverty reduction in China by testing a growth model with provincial data. Economic growth is the single most important factor influencing poverty reduction. Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) seems central to achieving that goal because it is a key ingredient for successful growth in China. FDI might reduce poverty through promoting economic growth and diffusing growth widely. Results of cross-section and panel estimates suggest that FDI is indeed an important source of China's economic growth and therefore a powerful force for poverty reduction. The more poverty could be reduced through government-led programs and polices that improve poor provinces' investment environments the more FDI is attracted.

AB With the emergence of global warming extremes, natural disasters around the world begin to increase, and the incidence of disasters in China rises every year. The occurrence of natural disasters has a serious impact on poverty alleviation and people's survival. Most natural disasters in China occur in areas with sinister terrain, fragile ecology and complex environment. However, frequent disasters and bad ecological environment in turn aggravate their vulnerability and lead to deep poverty. Therefore, this "coupling" of disaster and poverty brings difficulties to poverty alleviation and development, making the return of disaster to poverty a painful and difficult point for poverty alleviation and development work, and posing more severe challenges to the targeted poverty alleviation work nationwide. To achieve comprehensive poverty alleviation in 2020, build a well-off society in an all-round way of the goal, improve the ability of disaster prevention and mitigation in the poor areas, improve the catastrophe in the depth of poverty areas of the insufficiency of the disaster risk management, on the basis of discusses how to strengthen the disaster risk management ability, how to implement disaster areas of precision work the poor out of poverty, establish disaster risk management and precise coordination mechanism for poverty alleviation is the research contents of this paper.

Our reference scenario, which follows a post -pandemic economic trend with an annual economic growth rate of 2.05%, projects an extreme poverty rate of 7.34% (uncertainty range 6.29%-8.73%) in 2030. Even under optimistic settings, it may take over two decades to eradicate extreme poverty. Focusing more on environmental drivers of poverty and following historical trends in fiscal policies and social safety nets, we identified two robust strategies characterized by ambitious educational attendance, sustainable dietary choices, low fossil fuel consumption and energy de-mand, and low fertilizer use, which offset negative environmental effects without compromising the poverty eradication gains.

AB This paper provides an approach for rural women's empowerment to poverty reduction in Iran. Although, rural women are certainly a major contributor to poverty reduction in many rural areas in developed countries. But the result of this study found that women's empowerment is limited by the same cultural restrictions that limit their access to education and health services, and these impose serious constraints on their autonomy, mobility, and on the types of livelihoods that are available to them. The finding can assist the local and national organizations for remove this problem in face of women's participation for poverty reduction in Iran. [Fatemeh Allahdadi.

TI Dynamic impact of fdi inflows on poverty reduction: Empirical evidence
   from South Africa
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB This paper investigates the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and its sustainability in the reduction of poverty in South Africa from 1980 to 2014. The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between FDI and poverty reduction, which is important in formulating policies that can reduce the incidence of poverty in South Africa. To enhance the robustness of the results, three poverty-reduction proxies, namely: household consumption expenditure, the infant mortality rate, and life expectancy are used. Using auto-regressive distributed lag approach (ARDL), the empirical findings of this study reveals that the impact of FDI on poverty reduction is sensitive to the poverty reduction proxy and the time under consideration, i.e., whether the analysis is conducted in the long run or in the short run. When infant mortality rate (Pov2) is used as a proxy for poverty reduction, FDI has a positive impact on poverty reduction in the long run and a negative impact on poverty reduction in the short run. However, when poverty reduction is proxied by household consumption expenditure and life expectancy, the study found no significant relationship between FDI and poverty reduction in South Africa - irrespective of whether the analysis is conducted in the short run or in the long run.

AB Through providing products or financial assistance, poverty alleviation is an effective way to reduce poverty. With properties of decentralization, traceability, and publicity, blockchain technology has been well studied to solve the problems of corruption, single point of failure, and complex transaction procedure in traditional centralized poverty alleviation platforms. However, most of poverty alleviation programs in the market are built on single blockchain, which contain only one kind of product information. It is difficult for products to be exchanged on different blockchains, which limits the further expansion of poverty alleviation. This paper proposes a universal and efficient cross-chain fair exchange scheme for poverty-alleviation products. Specifically, we employ an adaptor signature scheme to achieve fairness in the exchange. It ensures that when one party gets the exchanged poverty alleviation product, the other party will also get his corresponding product. In addition, we also adopt the verifiable time discrete logarithm algorithm to solve the problem that the lack of a special scripting language does not allow us to set "timeout" on the transaction and fall into a deadlock problem. Finally, we deploy the scheme on the local environment, public test chains of Ethereum, and conduct a series of experiments to verify its effectiveness and efficiency.

TI THE IMPACT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON POVERTY REDUCTION IN VIETNAM
SO ECONOMICS AND FINANCE LETTERS
AB In Vietnam, the issue of decentralization and implementation of decentralization have been a concern for a long time. This study focuses on the impact of fiscal decentralization on poverty reduction in Vietnam. Based on the provincial data with the use of the two-stage least squares method (2SLS), the estimation results obtained for the two periods show that fiscal decentralization had an impact on income/ expenditure poverty reduction in the period from 2010-2015 and it had no significant effect on multidimensional poverty reduction in the period from 2016-2019. The study also found that economic growth, education and local welfare spending had an impact on poverty reduction in both stages, in which the impact of economic growth is relatively large, while the impact of welfare expenditures is relatively small in the locality. Improving infrastructure through information networks and increasing participation of people at the grassroots level have no impact on income/expenditure poverty reduction and multidimensional poverty in both the 2010-2015 and 2016-2019 periods.

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Improving the socioeconomic status of poor households has always been considered as an effective method to the help poor out of environmental inequality, but there is little literature to prove whether poverty alleviation measures can also have environmental deprivation for the poor. In this study, we explored whether the Chinese government's efforts for the poor to escape poverty can achieve environmental sustainability, and whether photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects (PPAP) can alleviate regional poverty while avoiding environmental deprivation. In order to find if the government's attempts to protect the environment and reduce poverty are effective, we evaluated in this article the impact factors of China's anti-poverty policy on the environmental sustainability in rural poor areas from the perspectives of poor households' environmental awareness and surrounding eco-environment. The methods used in this article are Entropy Weight Method (EWM) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). The results show that only anti-poverty policies related to education and sustainable agriculture have positive impacts on rural environmental sustainability. The direct effect of photovoltaic poverty alleviation policy on environmental sustainability in the poverty-stricken areas from a micro perspective is not optimistic. Poverty alleviation projects related to renewable energy should consider increasing the participation of poor households. Based on the conclusions of this study, we have proposed corresponding policy recommendations.

TI Trade-offs between poverty alleviation and household energy intensity in
   China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB The link between energy use and poverty alleviation is the root of the right balance between energy consumption reduction and ending poverty. However, only a few studies evaluated such issues with the decoupling analysis. We estimate the poverty alleviation level using the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index and investigate the decoupling relationship between poverty reduction and household energy intensity (HEI) during 2010-2017. Based on the change in the decoupling state, we develop two scenarios to project the impacts of poverty alleviation on household energy footprints (HEFs) by 2035. A pessimistic scenario assumes that the decoupling state by con-sumption category in each province stays unchanged, while an optimistic scenario assumes that all provinces achieve strong decoupling across consumption categories. The decoupling analysis shows an overall strong decoupling state in China during 2010-2012, 2012-2015, and 2015-2017. During 2010-2017, basic con-sumption (i.e., food and clothing) shifted from weak to strong decoupling, while enjoyable consumption (i.e., transport) reflected the opposite direction. The scenario analysis indicates that the total HEFs by 2035 in the optimistic scenario will be 3.64 * 107 TJ, which is smaller than that in the pessimistic scenario by 58.7%. Our study implies that fast economic development provides a pathway for the synchronous achievement of energy use reduction and poverty alleviation goals in China.

TI The impact of using an income supplement to meet child poverty targets:
   evidence from Scotland
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
AB In 2017 the Scottish Government passed the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act with the commitment to significantly reduce the relative child poverty rate from the current prevailing level of around 25% to 10% by 2030/31. In response, the government introduced the Scottish Child Payment (SCP) that provides a direct transfer to households at a fixed rate per eligible child - currently 25 pound per week. In this paper we explore, using a micro to macro modelling approach, the effectiveness of using the SCP to achieve the Scottish child poverty targets. While we find that the ambitious child poverty targets can technically be met solely using the SCP, the necessary payment of 165 pound per week amounting to a total government cost of 3 pound billion per year, makes the political and economy-wide barriers significant. A key issue with only using the SCP is the non-linearity in the response to the payment; as the payment increases, the marginal gain in the reduction of child poverty decreases - this is particularly evident after payments of 80 pound per week. A 'policy-mix' option combining the SCP, targeted cash transfers and other policy levels (such as childcare provision) seems the most promising approach to reaching the child poverty targets.

TI Livelihoods and rural poverty reduction in Uganda
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Uganda has put in place a comprehensive framework for poverty reduction known as the poverty eradication action plan (PEAP). A subcomponent of the PEAP, the plan for the modernization of agriculture (PMA) is designed to address the goal of reducing poverty in rural areas. This paper utilizes research on rural livelihoods in three rural districts to derive policy inferences relevant to this framework. Research findings show that rural poverty is strongly associated with lack of land and livestock, as well as inability to secure nonfarm alternatives to diminishing farm opportunities. Meanwhile rural families encounter a rural taxation regime associated with fiscal decentralization that is basically inimical to the expansion of monetary opportunities in rural areas. A fundamental contradiction between the goals of PEAP/PMA and decentralized rural taxation is revealed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, dynamic panel data is used for 15 countries corresponding to the period 1996-2016. Two models were estimated, one for poverty and the other for extreme poverty, in order to compare the effects of infrastructure on different indicators. The results revealed that the infrastructure has a significant impact on the selected indicators, especially on extreme poverty. Thus, it is recommended that governments emphasize the implementation of infrastructure projects as a fundamental tool for poverty and indigence reduction.

Evidence from dynamic ordinary least squares, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical correlation regression techniques showed that financial inclusion significantly reduces energy poverty in SSA. However, financial inclusion's impact on energy poverty reduction differs significantly among individual SSA countries.

We employ data from a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of families, conducted in 2015 through face-to-face interviews. Our results indicate that all four welfare programmes were inadequate in alleviating child poverty. This was either due to the deep poverty gap to be filled or high rates of exclusion error. Most programmes are also inefficient because of inclusion error. We conclude by suggesting some policy implications for the welfare programmes.

AB The growing interest in using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support poverty reduction efforts and strategies in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These interest ended up revealing how much the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) of many african nations have underestimated the importance of ICTs as a development tool. The fact that so little was mentionned about the use ICTs for poverty alleviation and creation of employment highlighted the confusion, and uncertainty of decision makers. At the country level, ICT is still to be effectively integrated into national poverty alleviation and development strategies. The question then is how ICTs can help achieve those objectives. How can ICTs be used as tools to fight against poverty? Poverty is widely recognized as multidimensional, encompassing food security, health, education, rights, security and dignity, amongst others as stressed by Bachelor & al in a model showing the intricate linkages between ICTs and most PRSP goals.
   The link between ICTs and poverty reduction strategy is therefore not that obvious. Although, researchers and development partners involved in poverty alleviation recognize more easily the linkage between ICT and poverty reduction strategies. In any case, it is a prerequisite to have a conducive environment and country readiness for ICTs implementation. Unfortunately, the current situation in many Sub-Saharan Africa countries, there is not yet a clear and effective policy and strategy for the use of ICT.

AB In recent years, precision poverty alleviation work has achieved great success under the strong support of the government. However, there are still some problems in the course of practice. Because of the lack of pertinence of the poverty alleviation policy, the reality of the policy constraints and other reasons, the poverty problem in many areas is still relatively prominent. In order to find out the difficulties and emphases of poverty alleviation accurately, the author analyzes the problems in the process of precision poverty alleviation through field investigation and reference, it is found that the poverty alleviation target is difficult in the practice of precise poverty alleviation, the pertinence of aid projects is not strong, the supporting measures do not correspond to the needs of poor households, and the efficiency of poverty alleviation funds management is low, in view of the above problems, this paper also puts forward the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions.

TI Economic liberalisation strategies and poverty reduction across Indian
   states
SO ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB The focus of the study is the pace of poverty reduction across Indian states and its determinants. In particular, the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and industrialisation in reducing poverty is examined. Empirical evidence shows that poverty reduction did occur during the 1990s following the implementation of India's economic liberalisation program, which included mainly industrial and FDI policy reform. The empirical analysis shows that, thus far, FDI has not contributed significantly to poverty reduction, but it did influence structural changes in the economy, particularly with respect to industry, which is an important driver of poverty reduction. The analysis clearly shows that states with dominant industrial sectors have been able to reduce poverty faster than states dominated by agriculture. It is argued that targeting of FDI in India has been misplaced. Had it been in the more labour-intensive manufacturing, it would have more effectively contributed to the reduction of poverty.

TI Forestry development to reduce poverty and improve the environment
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB Poverty reduction is a world-wide concern. At the end of 2017, according to the rural poverty standard in China, there were 30.46 million poor in China. However, complete poverty alleviation by the end of 2020 had been achieved. This is significant and complicated, especially as poverty-stricken areas and ecologically fragile areas overlap. During the process of poverty alleviation, the development of forestry projects was not only conducive to improving the environment but also an important way to reduce poverty. Therefore, based on an analysis of the causes of poverty-stricken areas, this study examined successful cases in different regions and proposed ways to promote economic growth: providing state subsidies for tree planting and forest maintenance; developing undergrowth economy; and/or initiating an industrial chain. It also introduces principles to promote forestry progress, according to local conditions, keeping a balance between economic development and the environment. This study provides effective ways to promote forestry development and rural poverty alleviation.

TI Addressing Child Maltreatment in New Zealand: Is Poverty Reduction
   Enough?
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB Jonathan Boston provides an insightful analysis of the emergence and persistence of child poverty in New Zealand (Boston, 2014, Educational Philosophy and Theory). His remarks on why child poverty matters are brief but, as he reports, "[t] here is a large and robust body of research on the harmful consequences of child poverty" (Boston 2014, pp. 10-11). One cost he does not explicitly mention is the increased risk of maltreatment faced by children living in poverty. Given the clear correlation between risk of abuse and poverty, Boston's recommendations might be expected to go some way to addressing New Zealand's appalling child maltreatment statistics. However, Boston himself identifies both fiscal and political barriers to the implementation of his proposed strategy. "Fundamentally", he observes, "without adequate multi-party agreement, it will be hard to reduce child poverty on a durable basis" and "[c]urrently, such agreement is lacking" (Boston, 2014, p. 21). Even if we accept Boston's strategies for child-poverty reduction, then, it is prudent to consider other responses to the consequences of child poverty. Significant and controversial aspects of New Zealand's 2013 White Paper for Vulnerable Children can be read in this light, and one of them - the proposal to use predictive risk modeling (PRM) to identify children at risk of maltreatment - is the focus of this commentary.

SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH
AB Microfinance services have emerged as an effective tool for financing micro-entrepreneurs to alleviate poverty. Since the 1970s, development theorists have considered non-governmental microfinance institutions (MFIs) as the leading practitioners of sustainable development through financing micro-entrepreneurial activities. This study evaluates the impact of micro-finance services provided by MFIs on poverty alleviation. In this vein, we examine whether microfinance services contribute to poverty alleviation, and also identify bottlenecks in micro-finance programs and operations. The results indicate that the micro-loans have a statistically significant positive impact on the poverty alleviation index and consequently improve the living standard of borrowers by increasing their level of income.

TI Understanding the Role of Rural Poor's Endogenous Impetus in Poverty
   Reduction: Evidence from China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Motivating the endogenous impetus of the poor to eradicate poverty is an endogenous dilemma that is difficult to solve using the current external poverty alleviation model. In this paper, based on the field survey data of 1112 poor rural households in China, we examine the impact of the poor's endogenous impetus on their poverty reduction. Firstly, we identify two different components of endogenous impetus: thought impetus and behavior impetus. Secondly, the poverty reduction (livelihood status) of farmers was used as an endogenous variable to construct a partial least squares model to verify our explanation of the role of endogenous impetus of the poor in poverty reduction. The results indicate that (1) both thought impetus and behavior impetus have a positive impact on the livelihood status of the poor; (2) the human capital, physical capital, and social capital of the poor have a positive relationship with the two components of endogenous impetus; and (3) endogenous impetus plays a mediation role between livelihood capital and livelihood status. As expected, human and physical capital have a positive and significant relationship with poverty reduction. The important enlightenment of this study is that it is very important to motivate the poor's endogenous impetus of escaping poverty in addition to improving external conditions such as livelihood capital owned by farmers in an effort to realize sustainable poverty reduction.

TI Predicting organizational responsiveness to poverty: Exploratory model
   and application to Brazil and the United States
SO EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Despite the fact that widespread, severe poverty is part of the national context in many countries, the private sector has done little to end world poverty and hunger. Among the many challenges to effective private sector engagement, understanding how to increase organizational motivation in this direction is essential. A model is developed to explain how four characteristics of the national context (issue salience of poverty, field cohesion of powerful stakeholders, field distance between rich and poor, and national concern with poverty alleviation) shape the competitive, legitimation, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) motives to alleviate poverty. In-group CSR and Universalist CSR are distinguished to reflect self-interested concern for employees and local communities on the one hand and a less utilitarian desire to alleviate poverty of marginalized, destitute individuals on the other. Together, these four characteristics of the national context and four organizational motivations may help explain cross-national variations in private sector poverty alleviation practices. Greater issue salience of poverty, less field distance between rich and poor, and a higher level of national concern about poverty alleviation in Brazil, relative to the United States, are predicted to explain why there are more private sector poverty alleviation efforts in Brazil.

TI The Environmental and Health Impacts of Poverty Alleviation in China:
   From a Consumption-Based Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and healthcare are the three biggest challenges for the Sustainable Development Goals. However, they are also inter-linked. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve these goals in a compatible manner at the national level. Given the growing consumption caused by poverty alleviation in China, this paper investigates potential impacts of poverty alleviation on the environment and health based on an input-output approach, air quality estimation model, and health loss assessment. Due to data limitations, the base year was set as 2012. Nevertheless, the scientific value of the paper is that it offers an important supplement for a preliminary estimation on a macro level. We find that poverty alleviation could be a substantial threat to the environment and health from a consumption-based perspective, and this trade-off can be explained by the uneven pollution footprints per capita among different income groups. From a policy perspective, the government should promote green production, green lifestyles, and healthcare when reducing poverty.

AB This research built a county-level multidimensional poverty measurement model to examine the regional development difference in poverty Alleviation of rural China. It revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of poverty reduction using spatiotemporal statistical methods and an evolution tree. The results showed the followings: (1) the comprehensive poverty in rural China continued to decline, and the poverty reduction mode changed from the partial to the overall balanced. Spatial heterogeneity of rural development existed, presenting a typical stepped structure that was high in the west and low in the east, where different levels of dotted poverty kernels were scattered. The overall spatial agglomeration of poverty declined and local spatial agglomeration was enhanced. (2) The dimensional development was unbalanced, and there were significant differences in poverty structure between the east and the west of rural China. The influence of economic growth on overall poverty alleviation had been slowing down. Meanwhile, the effects of social security and infrastructure on poverty alleviation were obvious and the impact of health care and cultural education gradually increased. (3) Spatially adjacent areas often had the similar evolutionary path of poverty reduction. Ecological poverty reduction will become a trend in poverty alleviation efforts, because some natural conditions become key factors to alleviate poverty.

TI Assessment of the effects of targeted poverty alleviation policy on
   differently poverty-stricken households: A multi-propensity score
   weighting model
SO REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Eliminating poverty is a multifaceted global challenge and a focal point of global development governance. With the implementation of targeted poverty alleviation (TPA), China's poverty alleviation efforts have had significant achievements. This study provides a new perspective by classifying poverty-stricken households based on poverty root causes at the household level, a multi-propensity score weighting model based on counterfactual inference is employed to examine the poverty reduction effect and policy precision on six non-equivalent poverty-stricken household groups in a Chinese county. The results reveal that the poverty reduction effects differed among poverty-stricken households with different root causes of poverty. Specifically, households impoverished due to disability have the lowest income of the six groups. The assistance policy effects also vary significantly and are found to be poorly suited to poverty-stricken households a lack of labor force and funds. A robustness test confirms this conclusion and a more nuanced analysis reveals that these differences are reflected in the wage and transfer incomes. Therefore, to ensure the stability of poverty reduction and the sustainability of income for poverty-stricken households, relevant associated aid policies need to place different emphases based on their household characteristics.

TI Spatial Heterogeneity Effects of Green Finance on Absolute and Relative
   Poverty
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In light of the growing emphasis on sustainable development, financial poverty alleviation has become an increasingly important strategy. This study explores whether green finance, a new financial tool aimed at achieving sustainable development, can effectively reduce poverty. Using data from 25 provinces in China between 2004 and 2019, the study builds the China Green Financial Development Index, using the improved entropy power method, and uses a spatial econometric model to analyze the linear and non-linear impact of green finance on absolute and relatively poor poverty. The results demonstrate that green finance has a positive impact on poverty reduction, with a more significant impact on rural poverty reduction than urban poverty reduction. Interestingly, non-linear results reveal that the impact of green finance on rural poverty alleviation has gradually weakened, while the impact on urban poverty alleviation has gradually increased. Moreover, the introduction of technological progress as an intermediary variable has revealed an intermediary effect between green finance and poverty reduction. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the link between green finance and poverty and suggests a new approach to poverty alleviation.

The paper suggests that business should take the knowledge and potential of poor people into consideration in its interfaces with different types of poor people: consumers, workers, property owners, etc. Furthermore, investigating how business can help reduce poverty while still earning a profit and ensuring customer satisfaction limits research on business approach to poverty, since it assumes that businesswill have some "not-for-profit" purposes. The findings point out that businesses with "not-for-profit" purposes serve as a promising area for further exploration and research of business approach to poverty alleviation.

The primary finding was that the overall poverty reduction effectiveness of the provinces declined during a decade of devolution. The implications of the study's findings are discussed, including their relevance for advocacy efforts aimed at reducing poverty and the future direction of research on social welfare policy.

TI The poverty of 'poverty reduction': the case of African cotton
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB African cotton has been an engine of immiseration. On this the historic record is clear. Since 2002 development policy and decision makers have attempted to treat aspects of this unwelcome condition by focusing official poverty-reduction efforts more explicitly on cotton. While these anti-poverty palliatives have doubtless been well-warranted, the preferred poverty pain relievers have under-performed. This article argues that poverty reduction efforts undertaken for African cotton at multiple levels over the past 13 years have been overly infused with neoliberal ideas. Many experts have simply not cottoned on to the possibility that prescriptions steeped in neoliberal predispositions might only alleviate some of the symptoms that their African 'patients' experience every day. In this context status quo poverty reduction initiatives come at a high potential risk and cost. Absent a rethink, in this case the poverty of 'poverty reduction' could well be cemented.

TI Child poverty, status of rural women and education in sub Saharan Africa
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Africa's disadvantaged children are often rural, malnourished, out of school, child brides or child labourers. Moreover, they tend to have illiterate mothers who have been denied access to productive resources. Our objective is to analyse the factors affecting child poverty. To this end, we studied the endogenous variables of under-five mortality rate, primary-school enrolment and child underweight. Endogeneity led to the use of Three Stages Least Squares simultaneous equations and fixed effects methods. The estimated elasticities indicate that female employment in agriculture has the greatest effect on under-five mortality rates, while the crop production index exerts the greatest effect on primary school enrolment and child underweight. The elasticity ranking demonstrates that what is at issue is not the effect of education on reducing child poverty or the effect of child poverty on reducing education, but the improvement of the status of women, particularly in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, policies for long-lasting solutions should highlight institutional quality as a prerequisite in child poverty reduction and present children and women with equal opportunities to satisfy basic needs and access productive resources.

TI Can Digital Financial Inclusion (DFI) effectively alleviate residents'
   poverty by increasing household entrepreneurship? - an empirical study
   based on the China Household Finance Survey(CHFS?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Based on data from CHFS, this paper explores the mitigating effect of DFI development to enhance household entrepreneurship on residents' income growth and asset poverty, and analyses whether there is significant diversity in the degree of impact between different regions and groups through a heterogeneity study. The study finds that DFI has a significant effect on poverty alleviation. In the mechanism analysis, the effect of DFI on income poverty and asset poverty alleviation through promoting household entrepreneurship is 2.97% and 9.27% respectively. In the heterogeneity, the development of DFI has a significant contribution to the alleviation of income poverty of rural residents and the alleviation of asset poverty of urban residents; among similar regions, the poverty effect alleviation effect is more pronounced for the group with higher education level. This paper enriches the research related to the promotion of entrepreneurship and thus poverty alleviation by DFI, and provides a theoretical basis and empirical reference for how to alleviate poverty by financial instruments.

TI Direct impact of inflow of foreign direct investment on poverty
   reduction in Pakistan: a bonds testing approach
SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB This empirical study examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and poverty reduction using some control variables in the context of Pakistan. The time-series data has been used to cover the period 1985?2016. The study found robust results of co-integration between FDI and poverty reduction in the long-run analysis. Moreover, to find the correlation between FDI and poverty reduction, this study used autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique to check the co-integration between FDI and poverty. The short-run and long-run analysis results indicate that FDI, the mobile phone users (per 100 inhabitants), life expectancy, and government expenditure contributes to poverty reduction. The results of variance decomposition method showed that bidirectional causality found between FDI and poverty reduction or both are Granger cause of each other. The ratio of inflow of FDI is not too high in Pakistan, so government with scared financial resources should improve the policies regarding FDI inflow. This analysis suggests policymakers divert their attention towards the betterment of institutions, establish FDI attractive inflow trading zones like other emerging economies.

TI Poverty Alleviation Efficiency of Tourism and Its Spatiotemporal
   Differentiation in Jiangxi Province of China Based on the DEA Model
SO SAGE OPEN
AB Based on the DEA model, this paper evaluates the efficiency of poverty alleviation through tourism in Jiangxi Province based on three aspects: comprehensive efficiency, technical efficiency, and scale efficiency. The results show that the overall efficiency of poverty alleviation through tourism in Jiangxi Province is gradually progressing toward a high level, with the average value in recent years reaching 0.765. Compared to other cities in the Province, Ganzhou and Fuzhou have the highest ranking by level of tourism poverty alleviation. However, the tourism development at present is not truly just or even, resulting in a gap between the efficiency levels of regions. There are some areas that have been in the effective state for a long time, while others are far lower than the average efficiency due to low technical efficiency in these areas. The spatial differentiation of tourism poverty alleviation efficiency across regions shows that the tourism poverty alleviation efficiency in the eastern region of Jiangxi Province is low compared to other parts. Although the overall efficiency of tourism poverty alleviation in Jiangxi Province does not fluctuate much, there are still some areas where the efficiency of tourism poverty alleviation continues to show a downward trend, indicating that the allocation of tourism resources in Jiangxi Province needs to be optimized and leaving much room for improvement in the efficiency of poverty alleviation.

TI Calculating a price index for families with children: Implications for
   measuring trends in child poverty rates
SO REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
AB This paper investigates the effects of varying consumption patterns for families with and without children on measured trends in child poverty. We first use data from consumer expenditure surveys to calculate price indices by family type. We next examine the effect of using these group-specific price indices on measured trends in child poverty. Although we find that, all else equal, children increase the cost of living, our calculations indicate that on average families with children experienced relatively lower inflation rates than families without children during the 1968 to 1987 period. While this result suggests that estimates of child poverty rates calculated using an average price index may have overstated secular increases in child poverty, we find that child poverty rates calculated using a price index specific to families with children are not substantively different from those calculated using an average index for all families.

TI Child poverty in South Africa: an assessment based on microdata for 1995
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
AB In this study we assess child poverty in South Africa by estimating multivariate models using household-survey microdata from 1995. The applied poverty line defines children as poor if they live in households with a disposable per capita income less than US$1 Purchasing Power Parity. In South Africa, people living under such income conditions must be considered extremely poor. The results show that children living in South Africa face a risk of being poor comparable to that of the average world inhabitant. Child poverty in South Africa is an issue with strong racial connotations. Large variations in child poverty rates across provinces are found and most of South Africa's poor children live in rural areas. The educational level of household head is a strong predictor of child poverty. The probability of child poverty is vigorously reduced if a household receives wage earnings, but is affected by households' demographic structure.

AB The proper solution to the problem of the poverty in Xinjiang is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue which is related to the security and stability of the northwest frontier of China. And the situation of the application of the poverty alleviation funds has become the key to the solution to these two issues. Since the implementation of the "August 7th" crucial plan for the poverty alleviation, the help-the-poor funding invested in Xinjiang each year is increasing year by year, and in particular, the efforts of the investment after 2007 have been significantly strengthened. The use of the poverty alleviation funds is mainly in the form of the poverty alleviation projects, the largest proportion of which is the investment in the production projects, followed by the construction projects and the training and education projects. And the investment of the education projects is too small, which may be one of the reasons that cause the instability in Xinjiang. From the supporting effects of the poverty alleviation funds, there are differences in the selection of the supporting fields of the poverty alleviation funds between the North and South Xinjiang. After the evaluation of the efficiency with the help of the Malmquist TFP index of the data envelopment analysis, we can find that technological progress is the main factor that causes the fluctuation of the efficiency of the funds for poverty alleviation in Xinjiang. From the different regions, the application of the poverty alleviation funds in the southern Xinjiang lacks the efficiency, while that in the northern region is relatively effective, and that in the entire Xinjiang becomes not effective enough under the influence of the southern Xinjiang.

TI Poverty alleviation programmes in India: A social audit
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB The review highlights the poverty alleviation programmes of the government in the post-economic reform era to evaluate the contribution of these programmes towards reducing poverty in the country. The poverty alleviation programmes are classified into (i) self-employment programmes; (ii) wage employment programmes; (W) food security programmes; (iv) social security programmes; and (v) urban poverty alleviation programmes. The parameter used for evaluation included utilization of allocated funds, change in poverty level, employment generation and number or proportion of beneficiaries. The paper attempts to go beyond the economic benefit of the programmes and analyzes the social impact of these programmes on the communities where the poor live, and concludes that too much of government involvement is actually an impediment. On the other hand, involvement of the community, especially the poor has led to better achievement of the goals of the programmes. Such endeavours not only reduced poverty but also empowered the poor to find their own solutions to their economic problems. There is a need for decentralization of the programmes by strengthening the panchayat raj institutions as poverty is not merely economic deprivation but also social marginalization that affects the poor most.

Exploring its causes and developing policy paradigms had remains a debatable issue, and also it posed many constructive avenues for scholarly research. In this context, the role of technological innovation for social change to address poverty alleviation is also a hot topic for research. Similarly, this study aims to explore the role of technological innovation, financial development, and globalization toward poverty alleviation efficiency in China. The study used the data from 2007 to 2018 and employed super-efficiency DEA model along with system GMM for empirical estimation. Our findings indicate that the poverty alleviation efficiency of various regions have been increased over the years. However, from a spatial perspective, China's comprehensive poverty alleviation efficiency is very unevenly distributed. Further, technological innovation and financial development positively influence the poverty alleviation efficiency in China. However, the results for the impact of globalization on poverty alleviation efficiency are insignificant. In the light of empirical findings, the study discusses some policy insights for decision-makers.

AB This article aims to explore the inner relationship between targeted poverty alleviation and financing constraints of listed companies, and further reveal the underlying impact mechanism. Based on the data of listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share main board participating in targeted poverty alleviation from 2017 to 2020, graded response models and mediation models are conducted. From the perspective of resource motivation, the study examined the relationship between the investment in targeted poverty alleviation and financing constraints of listed companies and introduces policy resources as mediator variable to reveal the underlying mechanism. The study found that the participation of listed companies in targeted poverty alleviation can significantly ease financing constraints, and policy resources can play an intermediary effect in the process. For enterprises with different equity nature, in state-owned enterprises, policy resources play a small intermediary role between poverty alleviation inputs and financing constraints. Meanwhile, in non-state-owned enterprises, government subsidies play a significant intermediary role, and tax incentives play a small intermediary role. In response to this, policy suggestions such as improving the disclosure of poverty alleviation information, expanding policy preferences, and increasing poverty alleviation subsidies have been suggested.

TI Leaving No One Behind: Multidimensional Child Poverty in Botswana
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Child poverty measurement is vital for informing policies and for improving children's lives. Nevertheless, efforts to measure (child) poverty remain dominated mainly by monetary approaches, and many countries fail to monitor multidimensional child poverty. Using the 2015/2016 Botswana multi-topic household survey, this study developed a child-centred, individual-level and composite measure that offers nationally relevant and context-specific insights into the magnitude and depth of multidimensional child poverty in Botswana. In particular, it did so through the lens of Leave No One Behind (LNOB) by zooming in on demographic, economic and geographical characteristics that may be associated with greater vulnerability or marginalisation using both descriptive and regression analysis. Results point towards a relatively high incidence and depth of multidimensional child poverty in Botswana. Results show that disabled children, orphans, children living in larger families, families headed by unmarried couples and living in rural areas are more likely to be multidimensionally poor.

TI How development of finance contributes to poverty alleviation and
   growth: A time series application for Pakistan
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB There is a well-recognized debate that financial sector development constitutes an important mechanism for long run economic growth. Through effective mobilization of domestic savings for productive investment, it also plays a crucial role for alleviation of poverty especially for developing nations. This study examines the cointegration and causality between development of financial sector, indicators of economic growth and poverty reduction in Pakistan during the time period ranging over 1975 to 2010. In this regard, annual time series data of different support variables that is, labor force and investment along with target indicators were rendered in the model for the assessment of long run relationship. Moreover, properties of the data were properly diagnosed prior to application of cointegration and causality approaches. The cointegration test finds the existence of long run equilibrium relationship between financial sector development, economic growth and poverty reduction. The multivariate VECM (Vector Error Correction Method) causality test at the end confirms the presence of unidirectional causality from poverty reduction to economic growth, economic growth to finance development, financial development to poverty reduction and economic growth to poverty reduction. It also finds no causality between finance development and economic growth, and poverty reduction and finance development. Major findings can be summarized in a way that economic growth is the policy variable to accelerate financial sector development and both could be used as the policy variable to reduce poverty in the economy.

TI Rapid socioeconomic change represented by catering industry contributes
   to poverty eradication in China
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Poverty is a severe problem faced by all nations. Eradicating poverty tops first in the Sustainable Development Goals. The elimination of poverty requires an understanding of what are the key contributors to poverty reduction, which makes it crucial to track the progress of poverty elimination for effective policy intervention and adjustment. Nevertheless, most present studies are limited to poverty prediction at a certain point in time, with less research conducted to investigate the dynamic spatial determinants of poverty eradication. China successfully eliminated extreme poverty at the end of 2020, and thus is a good example to investigate what causes poverty and how it is eradicated. Concerning the poverty reduction in China from 2014 to 2020, we combine multi-source geospatial data and random forest to answer what spatial factors cause poverty and which ones contribute most to poverty eradication. Results indicate that urbanization level and commercial development are the top two contributors to poverty identification, and they inherently determine the occurrence of poverty. It is interesting to observe that the rapid change of socioeconomic features represented by the restaurants is the major determinant in the process of poverty elimination. We suppose the multiple poverty alleviation pathways have led to the development of the catering industry, which helps lift the counties out of poverty. Overall, all the Chinese counties are moving towards a more balanced development with decreasing differences between poverty-stricken and non-poverty counties plus a decreased Gini index from 2014 to 2020. This comprehensive analysis benefits us in the understanding of the spatial determinants of poverty identification and elimination in China, which provides a solid example of poverty reduction in other developing countries.

TI Conceptual Debates on Poverty Measurement: The Use of Qualitative Expert
   Consultation to Guide Methodological Decision-making in Designing a
   Multidimensional Child-Poverty Measure
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Child poverty is a global concern which is usually not captured for monetary measures. Therefore, multidimensional approaches to measure child poverty have increased in the past decade. However, there is still no consensus about what constitutes multidimensional child poverty, how it should be measured, and which criteria should be adopted to identify poor children in a society. We discuss the opinions of experts in order to inform the methodological decision-making processes in multidimensional poverty measurement. We conducted thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 27 global experts on child poverty and poverty measurement. We contrasted the degree of agreement and reasons to include dimensions and indicators in a multidimensional child-poverty measure for low- and middle-income countries. We found agreement and disagreement about the inclusion of multiple dimensions and indicators. On the one hand, Education, Nutrition, Water and Sanitation, Access to Health Care, and Immunisation were the indicators with the highest levels of agreement. On the other hand, Safety, Child Labour, Access to Information, and Cultural Activities were the group of indicators producing less agreement between experts. We found that debates regarding decisions in the process of designing a multidimensional child-poverty measure were related to the theoretical perspectives on child poverty, the rationale of the indicators, the data available, and technical issues. In conclusion, methodological decisions about the selection of dimensions and indicators to measure multidimensional child poverty requires a critical reflection on the perspectives of poverty that the researchers use, the objective of the measure, the data available, and how deprivations can be operationalised.

AB Since twenty-first century, the third revolution of science and technology as the core of the internet information technology makes society become more and more "smart". Under the guidance of the strategy of "smart planet", the concept and practice of "smart countryside" emerged. Using of energy and information & communication technology access to rural society to build a new "Smart countryside" in the 3I situations (Instrumented, Interconnected, Intelligent), which helps rural and poor areas out of poverty with a new form of poverty alleviation under the background of the internet. The paper analyses the mechanism of "smart countryside" poverty alleviation from the four perspectives : sustainable development of energy, social capital and knowledge, bridging the digital divide and promoting the information rights. Then, the paper investigates and summarizes seven kinds of innovation model of "smart countryside" poverty alleviation. The conclusion shows that the innovation model is conducive to the "multi-level" ecological interaction of poverty alleviation, which is "government-led, social participation, industry development and the poor benefit". It also brings environment, economy, service, the humanities, and the people's livelihood performance for poverty alleviation. Finally, the paper puts forward policies supporting system for "smart countryside" poverty alleviation from the aspects of technology, space, capital and people.

TI Targeting and child poverty
SO SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE
AB We examine the relative merits of targeting children within the household through price subsidies and cash transfers. To do so, we model the behavior of a household composed of one adult and one child. We then show that 'favorable' distortions from price subsidies may allow redistributing toward the child and then derive the conditions under which this redistributive scheme is more efficient than cash transfers. The framework is extended to account for possible paternalistic preferences of the social planner and for households composed of two adults with different preferences. Applied to a continuum of households, our approach is extended to the problem of child poverty alleviation. In contrast to the traditional view, we show that well-chosen subsidies may be more cost effective than cash transfers in reducing child poverty.

TI Does industry convergence between agriculture and related sectors
   alleviate rural poverty: evidence from China
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Enhancing the synergies between agriculture and related sectors in rural areas is considered an important development strategy to eliminate rural poverty. This article provides evidence for this view by analyzing the effect of industry convergence between agriculture and related sectors on rural poverty. Based on China's provincial panel data, we use two-way fixed effects model, system generalized method of moments and panel-corrected standard error estimator to quantitatively assess this effect. We find that: (1) the convergence of agriculture and tourism (ATOU), the convergence of agriculture and processing industry (APOS), and the convergence of planting and breeding industry (MIXA) have positive and significant effects on poverty reduction. The convergence of agriculture and the internet industry (AINT) has a positive but not significant effect. (2) Rural local employment plays an important role as a bridge in the impact of convergence on poverty reduction. ATOU and MIXA reduce poverty by increasing self-employment opportunities. APOS reduces poverty by providing more jobs. (3) Except for APOS, the effects of other types of convergence tend to stabilize or improve in the later period. (4) Convergence has the most significant impact on poverty reduction in western China. The findings provide inspiration for developing countries with agricultural foundations to choose appropriate rural development paths for reducing rural poverty.

TI Does China's Flow of FDI and Institutional Quality Matter for Poverty?

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB The study adds to the discussion on the necessity for Sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries to eradicate poverty, as outlined in SDG 1 and Africa's Agenda 2063. This contribution was successful in achieving some key objectives. First, we examine the impact of Chinese FDI and institutional quality on the eradication of poverty in SSA. Second, we test empirically whether institutional quality can help Chinese FDI to reduce poverty in SSA. Using an annual dataset for 36 SSA countries for a 20-year period ending in 2020, our pooled OLS results showed that Chinese FDI does not reduce poverty unless there are strong institutions and good governance. Also, the results showed that strong institutions and good governance reduce poverty in SSA. As a result, we recommend that governments establish policies to develop systems and structures that encourage industrialization and attract foreign investors for SSA to reap the full benefits of Chinese FDI.

   The study examines the relationship between mobile phones, the internet, financial inclusion, the informal economy and poverty reduction using the system generalized method of moments approach and a panel data set of 42 African countries for the period 1995-2017.
   Findings
   The study shows that mobile penetration and internet usage have significant positive relationship with the informal sector. Financial inclusion has significant effects, meaning that increased financial inclusion is associated with a developed informal economy. Also, mobile penetration and internet usage play significant roles in the relationship between financial inclusion and the informal economy. Further, mobile penetration and internet usage have a significant positive relationship with poverty reduction. Similarly, financial inclusion has significant effects, meaning higher financial inclusion is associated with increased poverty reduction. The informal economy also has significant effects, suggesting that the development of the informal economy is associated with poverty reduction.
   Originality/value
   Most importantly, mobile penetration, internet usage and financial inclusion play significant roles in the link between the informal economy and poverty reduction.

SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB The Chinese Government has proposed the strategy of "targeted poverty alleviation" in its poverty reduction project among the poverty-stricken population while carrying out a forward-looking preparation for "rural vitalization." As is known, the "targeted poverty alleviation" serves the prerequisite of realizing the "rural revitalization strategy." Poverty alleviation through education plays the role of interdicting intergenerational poverty. Vocational education ranks for the highest input-output ratio, accounting for the best way for profit accumulation in poverty alleviation. Based upon the investigation of 1280 poor households in poverty-stricken regions of Longsheng County and Ziyuan County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, this paper introduces the long-term effect of poverty alleviation through vocational education by comparing the gap of the educational level and income between the poverty-stricken population and the population out of poverty with an analysis on the income structure of the poor. We recommend measures and suggestions for constructing a system of poverty reduction that is oriented towards rural vocational education, based on poor households' demand for vocational education and training.

TI Exploring China's Potential Child Poverty
SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB This paper estimates child poverty in China using 2018 data from the China Household Income Project. Applying the Alkire-Foster drawer approach, we constructed a multidimensional poverty indicator system that accounted for multiple factors contributing to a child's development and well-being, based on which we estimated multidimensional poverty experienced by children. Children's poverty varied by age, gender, rural/urban settings, and geographic region. By extending the Alkire-Foster drawer approach, two important features of child poverty in China were found, which had normally been neglected by per capita poverty measures: poor children in nonpoor families and unequal allocations to different children within the same families. The results showed that more than 40 percent of multidimensionally poor children lived in nonpoor families. Unequal resource allocation within families was observed in half of the families. These two features of child poverty require more policy attention and the Chinese government should prioritize addre ssing multidimensional child poverty.

Currently, alleviating poverty through starting a business is a widely applied mode and has far-reaching practical significance for solving social problems and benefiting economic development in impoverished areas. In both domestic and foreign documents, there has already been in-depth studies on entrepreneurial poverty alleviation policy from the aspects of empirical mode, implementation plan and policy mechanism. However, the evaluation system and path optimization of this policy still lack systematic theoretical framework and analytical research. Therefore, the evaluation index system of this policy and its effects can be refined from the perspective of entrepreneurial orientation, entrepreneurial awareness and entrepreneurial economy. Based on this logical framework and SPSS data analysis tools, this paper evaluates and analyzes the effect of entrepreneurial poverty alleviation policy in Qichun County, Hubei Province, summarizes the practical difficulties in its implementing process as well as exploring the path optimization of this policy

Mao County is the country's largest ethnic minority settlement. It uses the MPI analysis method to conduct multi-dimensional analysis of 245 households in four dimensions including education, health, income, and living conditions. It finds that household income structure and medical expenditure affect poverty. In the factor analysis, the individual factors and basic guarantees were added. SPSS 19.0 was used for logistics binary regression analysis. It was found that gender also had a significant impact on poverty. Through understanding the poverty status of the poverty-stricken households currently surveyed, the new understanding Poverty reduction factors, and the reconstruction of poverty alleviation policies, and further optimization of the poverty alleviation pathway, can play a positive role in the local poverty alleviation work.

AB This study examines the existence of a long-run relationship between indigence or extreme poverty reduction and agricultural, manufacturing and tourism development in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. An econometric methodology consisting of an autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to co-integration is used. For Costa Rica, agricultural and manufacturing (not statistically significant) and tourism development are negatively related to indigence poverty with estimated elasticity values of -0.50 for agriculture, -0.17 for manufacturing and -0.58 for tourism. For Nicaragua, the estimated elasticity values are -0.40 for agriculture, -0.13 for manufacturing (not statistically significant) and -0.64 for tourism. Tourism's rate of poverty reduction was statistically significantly greater than that of agriculture for both countries. The main contribution of this paper lies in the understanding of sector contributions to alleviating poverty. The methods utilized can be undertaken by most countries in the world, thereby providing insights into developing targeted investment policies and strategies to achieve higher rates of poverty reduction.

We argue that globalization can contribute much to poverty reduction both directly and by accelerating growth. Second, the contributions of redistributive policies are very likely to be less than the contribution of greater access to markets, more competitive insurance and financial markets, and improved institutions to poverty reduction. The potential effect of greater international integration on poverty reduction, however, is limited by domestic policy failures in developing countries and also by continued protectionism, particularly in developed countries.

SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB Despite postulations on the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid, and trade on growth, empirical evidence from extant research has been mixed. The focus of recent research has shifted from the growth effects of these international flows to their poverty reduction effects. However, results have also been mixed. Most studies have examined the empirical evidence of these flows separately and have mostly conducted single country studies. In this study, we use data from twenty-nine countries in Sub-Saharan Africa between the period 1990-2017 to analyze the effects of FDI, trade, and foreign aid on poverty reduction in a single model using the Feasible Generalized Least Square (FGLS) technique. Our results show that FDI and foreign aid have a negative effect on poverty reduction in the countries studied. These results suggest that the level of FDI required to alleviate poverty has not been reached, and foreign aid have not been properly channeled. However, the results show that trade has a positive and significant impact on poverty reduction, especially in low-income countries. We conclude with policy recommendations.

TI Has solar PV achieved the national poverty alleviation goals? Empirical
   evidence from the performances of 52 villages in rural China
SO ENERGY
AB As a momentous energy policy innovation endowed with the highest level of political support in China, the solar PV poverty alleviation project (PPAP) combines the development of clean energy with poverty alleviation, which was promoted together with the other five targeted poverty alleviation methods intensively. Nevertheless, is solar PV efficient for poverty alleviation in rural China? How much does PPAP contribute to poor villages compared with other methods? In this paper, we explored the PPAPs performance on the improvement of economic, social, ecological and infrastructure construction, by using the field survey data in 52 poor villages in 8 provinces throughout China and adopting methodologies of principal component analysis (PCA), data envelopment analysis (DEA) and grey relation analysis (GRA). The results indicate that: (1) The six poverty alleviation models have made positive contributions to poverty alleviation, and the PPAP ranks the last but one; (2) PPAP plays a minor role in poverty alleviation, suggesting that greater investment in PPAP will have little impact on the efficiency of poverty reduction in rural China; (3) limiting factors in achieving high poverty alleviation efficiency are insufficient scales and unreasonable investment distribution, and (4) Great regional differences exist in poverty reduction efficiency.

TI Performance of microfinance institutions in poverty alleviation: mapping
   the research front
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AUDITING AND FINANCE
AB Despite of a saturated literature on poverty alleviation through microfinance institutions, the link between performance of microfinance institutions and poverty alleviation has much scope to explore. Thus far, only 87 Scopus indexed documents are identified in this field. The aim of this paper is to scientifically map the existing literature using both bibliometric and systematic literature review. The findings of this study reveal the influential aspects of literature in terms of countries, institutions, journals, authors, articles, and topics. This paper also unveils five key research streams in existing literature: 1) social outreach, financial sustainability and poverty alleviation; 2) factors affecting MFIs; 3) efficiency of MFIs; 4) mission drift; 5) Islamic microfinance.

TI Public Spending Composition in Uganda and its Implications for Growth
   and Poverty Reduction
SO PUBLIC FINANCE REVIEW
AB This article examines the interrelationships between public spending composition and Uganda's development goals including economic growth and poverty reduction. The authors utilize a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to study these interrelationships. These results demonstrate that public spending composition does indeed influence economic growth and poverty reduction. In particular, the authors show that improved public sector efficiency coupled with reallocation of public expenditure away from the unproductive sectors such as public administration and security to the productive sectors including agriculture, energy, water, and health leads to higher gross domestic product growth rates and accelerates poverty reduction. Moreover, the rate of poverty reduction is faster in rural households relative to the urban households. A major contribution of this article is that investments in agriculture, particularly with a view to promoting value addition and investing in complementary infrastructure (e.g., roads and affordable energy), contribute to higher economic growth rates and also accelerate the rate of poverty reduction.

TI Poverty Reduction in A Transforming China: A Critical Review
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB This review essay surveys the literature that explains China's poverty reduction progress since the late 1970s. It examines three dominant explanations: geographic conditions, economic growth, and anti-poverty policies, whose impacts on poverty have evolved with China's socioeconomic transformation. The review finds that the government has come to play an increasingly significant part in mitigating geographic adversity and making growth more inclusive for the poor over the last two decades. However, our understanding of the political institutions and processes underpinning poverty reduction remains incomplete because most studies concentrate on national and provincial authorities but overlook the county government. As counties have gained considerable resources and authority in poverty reduction, an investigation of their capacity and efficacy is fundamental to explain their various poverty alleviation outcomes. This essay thus proposes a framework for future research that investigates county governments' bureaucratic arrangements and their relations to society to explain their performance in poverty reduction. This essay concludes with lessons and limitations of China's government-led poverty alleviation campaign.

TI An Approach to Study the Poverty Reduction Effect of Digital Inclusive
   Finance from a Multidimensional Perspective Based on Clustering
   Algorithms
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
AB The evaluation of clustering algorithms is intrinsically difficult because of the lack of objective measures. On the basis of the DIFI and China's Provincial Panel data, this study aims to test the poverty reduction effect of digital inclusive finance in three dimensions of income, education, and healthcare and further look at the transmission mechanism of digital inclusive finance in poverty alleviation. The results indicated that digital inclusive finance exerts a poverty reduction effect in three dimensions-medical poverty, income poverty, and education poverty. Of these, the coverage breadth significantly affects the alleviation of medical poverty, the use depth significantly affects the alleviation of income poverty and education poverty, and the digitization level affects the alleviation of poverty in three dimensions. The level of regional economic development plays an intermediary role in the poverty alleviation effect of digital inclusive finance. Compared with the western region, which is relatively backward in development, the poverty reduction effect of digital inclusive finance in the eastern region is more significant.

TI The effect of China's pilot carbon emissions trading schemes on poverty
   alleviation: A quasi-natural experiment approach
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB As an important new tool for ecological poverty alleviation, carbon trading compensation is combining ecological protection with rural poverty alleviation. This paper evaluates the poverty alleviation impact of China's pilot carbon emissions trading schemes (ETS) at the provincial level before and after the program, which was implemented from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, we measure poverty alleviation in terms of rural residential income growth and rural job creation. By exploiting the quasi-experimental variation in whether provinces were affected by this pilot ETS policy, our analysis finds that the ETS policy resulted in increases in rural residential income and employment. We find the estimated effects correspond to an increase of approximately 752.6 yuan in annual rural residential income and 2.35% in the ratio of rural employed population to the total employed population, accounting for 9.5% of the rural residents' income and 7.11% of the rural employment, specifically. The results imply that the implementation of ETS is beneficial to income growth and job creation for rural areas of China, which mean the ETS policy may be conducive to poverty alleviation in affected provinces.

AB While the developed world has reached the postmodern stage, the developing world is still struggling to fulfill minimum requirements of millions of people to survive. Since the 1950s when the international agencies launched its development efforts, poverty alleviation has remained on top of the agenda of all developing countries. Different approaches have been experimented over the last six decades. Despite all efforts, poverty alleviation programs have failed to eradicate poverty. Of all the factors responsible for the growing trend of poverty, the accountability of public officials remains an intriguing issue. Historically, vertical and horizontal mechanisms have been employed to ensure public accountability. Questions are now being raised about their effectiveness. This has paved the way for the market and social accountability mechanisms - in improving public accountability. Market mechanisms have also been under criticisms for their failure in improving the wellbeing of the poor people. Focus has now been turned to social accountability mechanisms which are expected to hold public officials accountable for their performance in poverty alleviation programs. This paper aims to explore the terrain of social accountability and its role in poverty alleviation programs in Bangladesh. The paper argues that despite the great potentials, social accountability mechanisms cannot work in Bangladesh owing to contemporary socio-economic and political realities.

TI Debt-Poor Kids
SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY
AB Child poverty in the United States has averaged around 20% since the late 1970s. During this time period, it has been consistently and considerably higher than poverty rates for other age groups. The case is often made that poverty in the United States is greatly underestimated. The many problems involved in measuring aggregate poverty rate also plague measures of child poverty. This article focuses on how interest payments on prior consumer debt affect government calculations of child poverty. After summarizing the negative consequences of child poverty, we use the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances to estimate child poverty rates by subtracting interest payments on consumer debt from household income. The article concludes with some policy proposals for reducing child poverty and the number of households ( especially those with children) who are "debt poor."

TI Sustainable poverty alleviation capacity construction of farmers in
   poverty-stricken areas under the background of rural revitalization
SO PLOS ONE
AB Rural revitalization aims to consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation. Furthermore, enhancing the sustainable poverty alleviation ability of farmers in poverty-stricken areas is a critical concern. Using samples of farmers in four regions of the Yunnan province in China, multidimensional poverty and sustainable poverty alleviation ability indexes were constructed. Furthermore, a multidimensional poverty double boundary method (A-F method) was used to identify multidimensional poverty, and binary logistic function in SPSS was used to perform a regression analysis between multidimensional poverty and sustainable poverty alleviation ability. Results showed that as the poverty dimension increased, poverty incidence rate in the four regions decreased, with middle poverty incidence rate being the highest. Ability poverty was then identified as the major type of poverty in the sample, with the group of poor farmers with a high dimension of poverty being the most affected. Therefore, based on the ability structure of sustainable farmers out of poverty, we analyze the prominent problem of the ability construction of sustainable poverty reduction and propose a path for promoting sustainable poverty reduction ability. Hence, we will effectively link poverty alleviation with rural vitalization.

TI Power and Poverty in China: Why Some Counties Perform Better in Poverty
   Alleviation?
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Eliminating poverty is a worldwide problem, but China has recently made major achievements in poverty alleviation. By the end of 2020, 832 nationally designated poor counties had all been lifted out of poverty within five years. Why do some poor counties perform better in poverty alleviation? This paper leverages a unique county-level dataset of 832 nationally designated poor counties in China and uses discrete-time event history analysis to understand the relationship between political institutions and poverty alleviation. We find that the presence of a county party committee secretary concurrently holding a higher rank position above the county level significantly increases the odds ratio of accomplishing poverty alleviation tasks. Previous studies have emphasized the important role of empowering people in democracies for poverty reduction. This study shows that empowering key governmental actors in authoritarian regimes can help them increase their bargaining power and improve the performance of poverty alleviation. In addition, this paper echoes the research on political institutions of authoritarian systems and deepens the understanding of the importance of the higher-ranking institution of Chinese officials.

TI Poverty Alleviation Practice and Theoretical Exploration Based on Small-
   Farm Household Production: A Case Study of a Small-farm "Nested Market"
   Poverty Alleviation Trial
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Market-oriented industry-type poverty alleviation has played an important role in targeted poverty alleviation in China, but this approach has had difficulty in obtaining comprehensive coverage of extremely poor small-farm households and faces many challenges. We therefore need to explore and innovate a variety of ways of alleviating poverty among poor small-farm households. A project for "poverty alleviation through nested market small-farm production" has been running for eight years in the villages of Taihang Mountains, Hebei Province. It started from the livelihood resources already possessed by small-farm households, then converted farm production of healthy agricultural products and local specialties into an "industry" that took ordinary urban consumers' demand for healthy foods as the corresponding exit point and nested markets as the organizational form of transaction and interaction. The trial shows that mutual trust and participation between the rural poor and the urban population has successfully transformed poor households' livelihood resources and social capital into income, achieving accurate, stable and sustainable poverty alleviation and highlighting the concepts of innovation, coordination, and green and shared development.

This paper informs these debates by examining trends over time in perceptions of child necessities, rates of child poverty and parental behaviours. Results indicate high levels of stability between 1999 and 2012 in public perceptions of child necessities, stable or increasing rates of child poverty and similarities in the profile of child poverty vulnerability. In both 1999 and 2012, findings show that the majority of parents prioritise children's needs, posing a challenge for coalition rhetoric, and suggesting that a focus on structural rather than individual causes of poverty may be needed.

TI TOURISM AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA: AN EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION
SO ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS
AB In this study, we examine the causal relationship between tourism development and poverty reduction in South Africa, using the annual data between 1980 and 2009. In order to address the methodological weaknesses of the previous studies, we have incorporated trade as an intermittent variable between tourism development and poverty reduction - thereby, creating a simple multi-variate model. The results of our study show that there is an overwhelming causal flow from tourism development to poverty reduction in South Africa. This finding has an important policy implication - as it demonstrates that the tourism sector, which has shown a phenomenal growth in South Africa in recent years, leads to poverty reduction. Other results show that, while tourism development Granger-causes trade both in the short run and in the long run, the causality from trade to tourism could only be established in the short run. The results also show a distinct causal flow from trade to poverty reduction. This applies irrespective of whether the causality is conducted in the short run or in the long run.

AB This paper selects the 50 state-level poverty-stricken counties in Guizhou province as the research object, and uses financial scale, financial efficiency and financial structure to represent the level of financial development in each county, using economic growth and income distribution as controlled variable. The poverty of every county is expressed by poor slow index. Applying the panel data model, the promotion of local financial development to the targeted poverty alleviation is studied. The empirical evidence shows that the financial scale, financial efficiency, financial structure, economic growth and poverty reduction of 50 national poverty-stricken counties in Guizhou province are positively correlated. However the financial scale is more significant to reduce the incidence of poverty than that of financial efficiency.

AB Since the 18th CPC National Congress, remarkable achievements have been made in helping the poor and tackling hardships, and the gap between the rich and the poor has been further narrowed, thanks to the proposal of precise poverty alleviation policies. At the 19th CPC National Congress, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era, and poverty alleviation and development work also entered the spurt of "eating hard bones and tackling tough issues." The target of precision poverty alleviation is rural farmers, but with the further deepening of poverty alleviation work, farmers are subjectively unwilling to be out of poverty, and the objective problems of lack of farming techniques and sales channels are gradually exposed. In order to solve these emerging problems in the process of precision poverty alleviation, we propose a strategy of using the Internet + background to build an integrated electronic platform. By injecting funds to farmers, providing veterinary diagnosis and treatment technologies and sales platforms, the Bank will implement a "peer-to-peer" model of innovative poverty alleviation and make full use of social resources to achieve the effect of highly integrated resources. In the end, it will help promote poverty alleviation while benefiting from multiple sources.

TI The Effects of Economic Pressure on the Resilience and Strengths of
   Individuals Living in Extreme Poverty
SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY
AB Economic pressure has negative effects on families living in poverty that require much resilience and strength to cope. Although the strengths perspective upholds many human service values, literature on how it can be used to build resilience of these families is scarce. This exploratory study reports on the relationship between the constructs of economic pressure and resilience among N = 194 individuals living in extreme poverty. The authors found a significant relationship between economic pressure and resilience, with higher economic pressure being associated with less resilience. However, family income was not a significant factor between economic pressure and resilience. Discussion is directed toward practice, policy, and research in enhancing the resilience and strengths of families living in extreme poverty.

Village Pay Phone (VPP) Program - an NGO led initiative has been hailed as one of the first program to use telephone for poverty alleviation [16]. The success of this program led to low-income entrepreneur both in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh to take similar kind of initiative. Studies on VPP program show it can reduce poverty in rural areas. This paper focuses on the performance of the enterprises, which are not in VPP program. We conclude that these initiatives are equally effective in alleviating poverty

AB This paper firstly proposed an analytical framework for the relationship between ecosystem services value (ESV) and multidimensional poverty-reduction index; then, it conducted a quantitative assessment of ESV including ecosystem disservices in China's Three Gorges Reservoir region; next, it explored the interactive relationship between ESV and multidimensional poverty-reduction index in an attempt to reveal the contribution of ecosystem services to poverty reduction in this special region. The results indicate that: (1) There is a long-term co-integration between ESV and multidimensional poverty-reduction index, and their coupling degree is on the rise; ESV plays an important role in improving social security and mitigating poverty; (2) There are high correlations between climate regulation, waste treatment, maintenance of genetic diversity, environment purification, landscape aesthetics, maintenance of soil fertility and multidimensional poverty-reduction index, making the greatest contribution to poverty reduction in the region; and (3) Contributions of different specific ecosystem services to poverty reduction are varied considerably among different categories of ESV. Finally, this paper proposed policy recommendations for the synergy between eco-environmental protection and poverty reduction based on the findings of this research.

SO SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB Although the poverty rate in Indonesia has been declining in the last several years, the rate of poverty decline is slowing down. In order to achieve its poverty reduction target within the stipulated time period, the government has stepped up efforts to enhance the contribution of the financial sector towards poverty reduction. This study aims to empirically explore the interlinkages between financial sector development and poverty reduction in Indonesia. Focusing on annual data covering the period from 1980 to 2015, the study adopts the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration approach to examine the long-run relationship between the variables. The study found that there is a long-run relationship between financial development, economic growth, and poverty reduction in Indonesia. It also documented a unidirectional causality running from the financial sector to poverty reduction and a bidirectional causality between economic growth and poverty reduction. Therefore, policies to ensure the conducive growth of the financial sector would go a long way in promoting the economy, creating employment opportunities, and consequently accelerating poverty eradication.

TI Remediating child poverty via preschool: exploring practitioners'
   perspectives in England
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY YEARS EDUCATION
AB Within developed countries child poverty is a social problem with significant negative effects. With a backdrop of austerity, the UK's first child poverty strategy was released in 2011. Pervaded by neo-liberal ideology this strategy identifies preschool services as key to remediating the negative effects of child poverty on children and families as a means to 'unlock social mobility'. Drawing on interviews with preschool practitioners working in the poorest region of England, this article provides a rare, close-up insight into how they have responded to assumptions about their role within the policy discussions and debates about child poverty. Findings reveal how those interviewed have internalised the UK Coalition government's discursive formation of child poverty and social justice. Their narratives also indicate how, alongside the child poverty strategy, 'policy technology' accompanying the emergence of related reforms to the preschool sector in England and financial cuts are regulative and restrictive to practitioners' thinking and actions. Although only small scale, this research identifies challenges which will potentially prevent practitioners from creating the conditions necessary to address the effects of child poverty and ensure the Coalition government's vision of social justice in England.

TI Modeling Causality Between Financial Deepening and Poverty Reduction in
   Egypt
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This study deals with the linkages between financial development and poverty reduction in Egypt using data for the period of 1975Q1-2011Q4. The stationarity properties of the variables are tested by applying Zivot-Andrews structural break unit root test. The structural break autoregressive distributed lag-bounds testing approach to cointegration is used to examine long run relationship between the variables. Our results show evidence of cointegration which confirms the presence of long run relationship between financial deepening, economic growth and poverty reduction. The results indicate that financial development reduces poverty when domestic credit to the private sector is used as proxy for financial development. The direct channel that financial sector development can lead to enabling the poor to access or broaden their access to financial services, such as credit and insurance-risk services, is therefore confirmed in case of Egypt. Furthermore, the indirect channel where financial sector development contributes to poverty reduction through economic growth is also confirmed for Egypt. This is only found when M2 is used as a proxy for financial development and infant mortality per capita as proxy for poverty. While our results show that the causal relationship between financial development and poverty reduction in Egypt is sensitive to the proxy used to measure these variables, the results show that the poverty-reduction programs are desirable in Egypt, not only because they reduce poverty but also because they possibly lead to further development of financial sector in long run. Furthermore, our results show that appropriate reforms aimed at developing a financial sector in Egypt that is well-organized and spread throughout the country can help reduce poverty by availing more domestic credit to the poor.

TI Poverty eradication in a carbon constrained world
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aims to keep warming below 2 degrees C while recognizing developing countries' right to eradicate extreme poverty. Poverty eradication is also the first of the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper investigates potential consequences for climate targets of achieving poverty eradication. We find that eradicating extreme poverty, i.e., moving people to an income above $1.9 purchasing power parity (PPP) a day, does not jeopardize the climate target even in the absence of climate policies and with current technologies. On the other hand, bringing everybody to a still modest expenditure level of at least $2.97 PPP would have long-term consequences on achieving emission targets. Compared to the reference mitigation pathway, eradicating extreme poverty increases the effort by 2.8% whereas bringing everybody to at least $2.97 PPP would increase the required mitigation rate by 27%. Given that the top 10% global income earners are responsible for 36% of the current carbon footprint of households; the discourse should address income distribution and the carbon intensity of lifestyles.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND
   MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThis study aims to propose a ShariMODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGah-based and information and communication technology-driven microfinance model (SIMM) to reduce extreme poverty in rural areas. Existing microfinance models run by microfinance institutions exclude severely poor individuals from their activities. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses an exploratory sequential mixed-method design structured as Studies 1 and 2. Study 1 uses the grounded theory methodology to develop the emergent SIMM through interviews and focus group discussions with the participants (12 rich, 6 rural elites and 18 poor) of the target village. Study 2 uses a survey of 421 household members in the target village to evaluate their attitudes (ATT), subjective norms (SN) and perceived behavioural control (PBC) related to SIMM. Partial least squares-based structural equation modelling is used to evaluate relationships between constructs. FindingsStudy 1 identifies seven themes, in which aspirational hope is recognised as a core theme. Study 2 indicates significant relationships between ATT and PBC and between SN and PBC. Thus, the SIMM can alleviate poverty in rural communities. Practical implicationsThe application of the SIMM in the pilot study provides aspirational hope for eradicating extreme poverty. Social implicationsOther rural communities should be encouraged to apply the SIMM to alleviate extreme poverty in their villages. Originality/valueThis study contributes to the development of an innovative microfinance model (SIMM) to eradicate extreme poverty in rural areas.

TI Religious atmosphere and corporate poverty alleviation: empirical
   evidence from China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB Purpose This study explores whether religion plays an important role in corporate poverty alleviation. Religious atmosphere affects managers' attitude towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) and then influences corporate poverty alleviation. This study first examines the impact of religious atmosphere on corporate poverty alleviation and then investigates whether formal institutions, such as law enforcement environments and ownership, influence the relationship between religious atmosphere and corporate poverty alleviation behavior. Design/methodology/approach In 2016, the Chinese government initiated a nationwide campaign aiming to eliminate poverty in China by 2020. The authors conduct empirical tests with data on Chinese listed firms from 2016 to 2020. The religious atmosphere is measured by the number of Buddhist monasteries and Taoist temples within a certain radius around Chinese listed firms' registered addresses. The authors adopt the ordinary least squares (OLS) method for regression and take the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method to address the endogeneity issue. Findings The results show a positive relationship between religious atmosphere and corporate poverty alleviation donations. Law enforcement attenuates the positive association between the religious atmosphere and corporate poverty alleviation donations. Religion and corporate poverty alleviation donations have a more positive association for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Research limitations/implications The authors' findings have important implications. First, this study inspires incorporating the ethical value of traditional culture, such as religion, into CSR. Second, the findings imply that informal institutions have a greater impact on corporate decision-making when formal institutions are weak, suggesting that informal institutions should be emphasized when promoting CSR in countries where formal institutions are relatively weak. The study investigates only religious influence on corporate poverty alleviation based on Buddhism and Taoism, but the authors do not examine the impacts of other religions. Future research may examine the relationships between other religions and corporate poverty alleviation in China. Originality/value This study illustrates the positive role played by religion in promoting CSR by relating religious atmosphere to corporate poverty alleviation. It fills the research gap between religion and CSR and also contributes to the literature on determinants of corporate poverty alleviation.

TI Public Policies of Welfare State and Child Poverty in the European Union
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Combating child poverty is desirable to ensure equality of opportunities across children, as well as fostering the sustainability of the societal well-being for future generations. This paper focuses on the study of child poverty in the 28 Member States of the European Union over the period 2008-2018. We analyse the relationship between child poverty and government social expenditure by controlling it with tax structure (ratio direct taxes over indirect taxes), economic growth and socio-demographic characteristics. For that, we rely on panel data methodology. This paper has verified that the effectiveness of the government social spending programmes to reduce child poverty also depends on the progressiveness of the country's tax structure. Government spending on health and education programmes could be more effective in reducing child poverty in Member States with less progressive tax structure, provided they reached the average level of public spending for the whole of the European Union. By contrast, a positive relationship between child poverty and government social protection spending regardless of the tax structure of countries was found. In this case, the underlying forces that lead to less effectiveness of social protection programmes are also stronger in the less progressive Member States.

AB Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim big - as one of its target is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 for all people everywhere. This paper offers a critical review and outlines some potential challenges in achieving this noble target. In doing so, it offers a critical review of poverty scholarship to assess the notion of extreme poverty adopted in the SDGs. This also takes stock of past global anti-poverty programmes to set an appropriate context for forecasting potential challenges to eradicate poverty everywhere. It is highlighted that i) a number of poor countries will have to perform a magic against their track records, ii) the world needs to be consistently peaceful, iii) significant and equitable reform should take place within world economic structure, iv) quality and international comparability of poverty data in poor countries need to be improved significantly, and v) uncertainty about required investment in poor countries should be addressed rigorously in order for achieving poverty eradication target of the SDGs. These lead to the argument that without strong political commitments by all related stakeholders and an approach to look beyond existing models poverty eradication target may turn out to be another statement of good intentions by the international aid architecture with little meaningful practical relevance.

AB The main aim of this study is to examine how the role of Islamic banks, economic growth, and price stability on poverty reduction in Indonesia from 2010 to 2019. Total Financing (TF), Financing to Deposit Ratio (FDR), Non-Performing Financing (NPF), Return on Assets (ROA), and Third-Party Funds (TPF) monthly time series data were used to measure Islamic banking role, while economic growth, price stability, and poverty, were measured by Industrial Production Index (IPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Poverty headcount ratio (POV), respectively. The short- and long-term effects of Islamic banks, economic growth, and price stability on poverty reduction in Indonesia are examined using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound test. The study documented that Islamic banking, economic growth, and price stability had a significant short and long-term effects on poverty reduction. These findings offer various key implications for the banking industry and policymakers in order to eradicate poverty through strengthening economic growth, Islamic banking sector, and price stability. The Islamic banking industry should provide a quality of financing allocation to promote economic growth and price stability that, in turn, reduce poverty.

TI Addressing Child Poverty: How Does the United States Compare With Other
   Nations?
SO ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS
AB Poverty during childhood raises a number of policy challenges. The earliest years are critical in terms of future cognitive and emotional development and early health outcomes, and have long-lasting consequences on future health. In this article child poverty in the United States is compared with a set of other developed countries. To the surprise of few, results show that child poverty is high in the United States. But why is poverty so much higher in the United States than in other rich nations? Among child poverty drivers, household composition and parent's labor market participation matter a great deal. But these are not insurmountable problems. Many of these disadvantages can be overcome by appropriate public policies. For example, single mothers have a very high probability of poverty in the United States, but this is not the case in other countries where the provision of work support increases mothers' labor earnings and together with strong public cash support effectively reduces child poverty. In this article we focus on the role and design of public expenditure to understand the functioning of the different national systems and highlight ways for improvements to reduce child poverty in the United States. We compare relative child poverty in the United States with poverty in a set of selected countries. The takeaway is that the United States under invests in its children and their families and in so doing this leads to high child poverty and poor health and educational outcomes. If a nation like the United States wants to decrease poverty and improve health and life chances for poor children, it must support parental employment and incomes, and invest in children's futures as do other similar nations with less child poverty.

TI Internet access and poverty reduction: Evidence from rural and urban

SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
AB Using data from Mexico's 2016 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH), we estimate the impact of Internet access on the multidimensional and income poverty of rural and urban Mexico. Based on a Propensity Score Matching approach, our results show that Internet access helps reduce poverty levels in Mexico. Findings also reveal differentiated effects in the two indicators accounting for greater deprivation. The impacts on reducing extreme income poverty and extreme multidimensional poverty are more significant for the rural sector than for the urban sector. The results suggest policy measures aimed at solving issues that limit Internet access for individuals and households with higher social vulnerability, thereby contributing to a reduction of the poverty levels experienced by an important segment of Mexico's population.

TI Dynamic Nonlinear Connectedness between the Financial Inclusion,
   Economic Growth, and China's Poverty Alleviation: Evidence from a Panel
   VAR Analysis
SO COMPLEXITY
AB Whether financial inclusion and economic growth can sustainably release poverty alleviation effects in long term has been the focus of academia and government sector. This article uses provincial panel data from 2004 to 2019 to examine the dynamic nonlinear connectedness between the financial inclusion, economic growth, income inequality, and poverty alleviation; the main objective is to reveal the direction and intensity of the long-term and short-term impact of each factor on poverty alleviation. By building a panel vector autoregression model (PVAR), the comparison analyses of national, eastern, central, and western sample groups verify the existence of dynamic nonlinear connectedness among the four variables. The study found that there is complex bidirectional causality between these variables, financial inclusion has the long-term impact on promoting poverty alleviation in China, the impact of economic growth is relatively weak, and income inequality has weakened the positive impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation. Through the analysis of impulse response function, variance decomposition, and time-varying nonparametric estimates in different economic regions, we find that the impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation presents a U-shaped characteristic, and the contribution of financial inclusion to poverty alleviation in western regions is significant, but poverty reduction in eastern and central region mainly depends on economic growth. For policymakers, financial inclusion can be an effective way to alleviate relative poverty, but the poverty governance should focus more on reducing income inequality in China.

AB If the United States finally ratifies the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), will it improve the country's abilities to effectively combat child poverty and thereby improve child well-being? This article addresses this and related questions in two ways. First, the authors examine how ratification of the CRC has influenced the efforts of other wealthy Anglophone countries to reduce child poverty. Second, they draw on lessons learned from these other countries' efforts to generate predictions about America's postratification future. The authors conclude that, while the CRC is a compelling, practical tool, a communications strategy and business plan are necessary complements to achieve desired results.

TI Impacts of poverty alleviation on household GHG footprints in China
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Eradicating poverty and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are core issues of global sustainable development goals (SDGs), and China is struggling in realizing these targets. The poverty reduction that leads to popualtion structure and lifestyle changes would have an impact on GHG emission changes. However, few studies have assessed the historical and future impacts of the poverty allevation on China's emissions. Here by linking Chinese Multi-Regional Input Output (MRIO) database to the global MRIO database EXIOBASE, and using provincial household consumption data, we identified the distribution of Chinese household greenhouse gas footprints (HGFs) by income groups in 2015 at the national and provinical levels. Moreover, we focused on the historical impact of poverty alleviation on HGFs during 2010-2015, and developed four scenarios to project future HGFs changes due to poverty alleviation by 2030. We find that eradicating extreme poverty in the secanrio S2, i.e., bringing people to an income above $1.9 daily, does not cause a large emission impact with current technological level. However, lifting people from a higher poverty line of $5.5 per day in the sceanrio S4 results in a 1.6% increase in emissions compared with the scenario S1 without any poverty reduction goals. Furthermore, realizing a higher poverty reduction target will result in an increase of emissions contribution from internatioanl supply chains due to the differences in consumption patterns among different income groups. Our study highlights the conflict between the high poverty alleviaition goal and emission reduciton in China, and reminds us of the need to make more technological efforts for avoiding the large emissions embodied in international supply chains.

TI Child poverty among racial minorities and immigrants: Explaining trends
   and differentials
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
AB Objective. This article examines the effects of changing family structure (including cohabitation) and maternal employment during the 1990s on child poverty rates across America's diverse racial and ethnic groups. Unlike most previous studies focused on broad pan-ethnic groups, our analyses examine children distinguished by race/ethnicity, immigrant generation, and national origin (e.g., Mexican, Japanese, Middle Eastern, among others). Methods. The analyses, using methods of demographic standardization, are based on data from the 1990 and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples of the U.S. Decennial Censuses. Results. Child poverty rates declined broadly across population groups in the 1990s. Increasing maternal employment during the 1990s, rather than changing family structure, accounted for the largest share (nearly 40 percent) of the recent decline in child poverty rates. Changes in family structure played a minor role in reducing child poverty for most of the 25 groups considered in this article. Differences in family structure accounted for a large part of observed child poverty differences between minority groups. Conclusions. Rapid increases in maternal employment during the 1990s provided a hedge against rising child poverty and a route to economic self-sufficiency for growing shares of single mothers and their children.

SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB The first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is intended to eradicate multi-dimensional poverty globally. The same multidimensional poverty indices for India and the Middle East/Africa in 2020 indicate that 10-14 years are still required to reach the level of China's poverty eradication. Using machine learning, spatial statistics, and a scenario analysis, we demonstrate how a Monte Carlo simulation of poverty alleviation funds-guided shared socioeconomic pathways (PAFs-SSPs) in China reveals the necessity to adopt an integrated poverty alleviation strategy. This approach employs multi-dimensional development indicators to reduce wide regional differences. We developed the data-driven model framework of a PAFs-SSPs to analyze the multifaceted and long-term planning needs of poverty alleviation policies, which can be applied to the formulation of poverty alleviation policies in different developing countries. Our findings point to the importance of implementing multidimensional development policies in China to achieve the first SDG worldwide.

TI Financial permeation and rural poverty reduction Nexus: Further insights
   from counties in China
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB We investigate how financial permeation affects rural poverty reduction by matching represen-tative county household data with the local banking market, FinTech development, and county characteristics data from China. We discover that financial permeation via bank branch expansion boosts household income and mitigates household vulnerability to poverty, and these effects are magnified on lower-income and more vulnerable households, especially in impoverished counties. Further considering the potential substitution effect of FinTech, we verify that enhancing financial permeation via bank branch expansion still matters to rural poverty reduc-tion even in the digital era. Exploring the channels, we find that financial permeation accelerates rural poverty reduction directly through improving financial utilization and motivating invest-ment activities and indirectly through spurring local economic growth. Notably, the more pro-nounced marginal effects of the channels on households in impoverished counties, to some extent, explain the poverty reduction effect of financial permeation. The results imply the necessity of financial permeation via bank branch expansion for the realization of shared prosperity.

AB The paper investigated the contribution of agricultural production to poverty reduction in Cameroon using an extended generalized Cobb Douglas production function that was linearised by natural logarithm to appropriate it for multiple regression usage. The OLS estimation technique was then used to exploit data about the variables from World Development Indicators from 1980 to 2013. The results were significant at 1 % and show that 94.73% of the independent variables were responsible for expressing changes in the dependent variable. Food production positively but insignificantly contributed to poverty reduction whereas livestock production, household final consumption had a positive and significant contributions to poverty reduction by raising the gross national income per capita. Net official development assistance and official aid contribute negatively to poverty reduction in Cameroon. We therefore recommend that more concrete policies and investments aimed at supporting livestock and food farmers with financial, infrastructural and technical assistance be drafted and implemented through good governance, transparency and good faith for long term projects in the sector as some of the dreams for Cameroon to realize its new generation agriculture and the 2035 vision.

TI RACE, FAMILY-STRUCTURE, AND CHANGING POVERTY AMONG AMERICAN CHILDREN
SO AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB The link between family structure and the changing economic well-being of American children since 1960 is examined using child records from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample, and from the 1988 March Current Population Survey.  We find that:  (1) child poverty rates would have been one-third less in 1988 if family structure had not changed since 1960; (2) changing family structure accounted for nearly 50 percent of the increase in child poverty rates since 1980; (3) changing maternal employment patterns placed significant downward pressure on child poverty from 1960 to 1988, but could not prevent the overall rise in child poverty during 1980s; (4) racial divergence in family structure since 1960 exacerbated the persistent black-white differences in children's economic status; (5) racial differences in parental work patterns since 1960 acted to reduce racial differences in child poverty; and (6) that changing family-size differentials between poor and nonpoor households exerted upward pressure on child poverty rates, especially among whites.  Our results reinforce the view that child poverty and racial inequality cannot be separated from the issue of changing family structure in America.

TI Poverty alleviation in rural China: policy changes, future challenges
   and policy implications
SO CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Purpose Poverty alleviation is a global challenge. Human society has never ceased to fight against poverty. China was once the developing country with the largest rural poor population in the world. Remarkable achievements have been made in China's antipoverty program over the past decades, shaping a unique poverty reduction strategy with Chinese characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to first review the history of China's rural reform and antipoverty, and then analyze the related policy systems, mechanism innovations and future challenges in poverty alleviation and development. At last, some specific policy implications were provided.
   Design/methodology/approach Literature on China's antipoverty history was reviewed and mechanism innovations on targeted poverty alleviation strategy were investigated.
   Findings Along with the deepening of the rural reform, the poverty alleviation and development in new China have undergone six stages, and experienced a transformation from relief-oriented to development-oriented poverty alleviation. The object of poverty alleviation has gradually targeted with a transformation from poor counties/areas to villages/households, and the effectiveness of poverty alleviation is also gradually improved. However, the increase in the difficulty of antipoverty, fragile ecological environment, rapid population aging and rural decline poses challenges to the construction of a well-off society in an all-round way in China. Specific antipoverty measures were put forward based on the investigation. Finally, the authors emphasize the importance of strengthening the study of poverty geography.
   Originality/value This study investigates the history of China's antipoverty policy and analyzes the future challenges for implementing targeted poverty alleviation policy. These findings will lay a foundation for the formulation of China's antipoverty policies after 2020, and provide experience for poverty alleviation in other developing countries around the world.

AB This study explores the relationship between firms' engagement in poverty-alleviation campaigns and stock price crash risk. We use a large sample of Chinese firms listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets and find that firms' engagement in poverty alleviation campaigns is positively associated with future stock price crash risk. Moreover, the positive relationship between firms' engagement in poverty alleviation campaigns and crash risk is more pronounced for state-owned enterprises and firms with relatively concentrated ownership. However, this is less pronounced for those with higher analyst and media coverage. Our results are consistent with the agency theory, suggesting that engaging in poverty alleviation campaign may facilitate managers' bad news hoarding behavior and increase stock price crash risk.

TI The Measurement of Green Finance Development Index and Its Poverty
   Reduction Effect: Dynamic Panel Analysis Based on Improved Entropy
   Method
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Finance contributes to poverty alleviation through economic growth, and the development of green finance is related to the sustainable development of the world economy and environment. Green finance not only helps promote sustainable economic development but also helps reduce poverty. Based on the analysis of related theories about green finance and poverty alleviation, this paper selects 18 indicators from three dimensions of economic development, financial development, and social environmental development and uses the improved entropy method to measure the green finance development index of China's 25 provinces and municipalities from 2004 to 2017. The results show that the development level of green finance in China's 25 provinces and municipalities is quite different. On the basis of the above analysis, make an empirical analysis of the impact of the green finance development index on poverty alleviation using multiple regression analysis and static panel and dynamic panel estimation methods. The research results show that there is a significant positive correlation between green finance and poverty alleviation; the higher the level of green finance development, the more conducive the poverty alleviation. So, this paper suggests that poverty can be better alleviated by improving the level of green finance development, financial asset level, and economic development level.

TI The Future Path To China's Poverty Reduction-Dynamic Decomposition
   Analysis With The Evolution Of China's Poverty Reduction Policies
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB The paper uses the Shapley method to decompose poverty changes by income source and growth-distribution-cost according to the history of China's poverty elimination policies in the last forty years. The analysis shows that economic growth contributed to most of the reduction in all periods. Increasing inequality has adverse effects on poverty elimination in that it makes people vulnerable to poverty, which bodes ill for future poverty alleviation. Wages explain most of poverty change for both the urban and rural areas in recent years and are the main reason for increasing inequality in rural areas. Agricultural income played a significant role in reducing rural poverty and inequality in early periods when China experienced many agricultural reforms. In the future, pro-poor growth, reducing inequality and building a relatively integrated urban-rural poverty alleviation system will be most important jobs for China's poverty reduction.

TI Regional determinants of poverty alleviation through entrepreneurship in
   China
SO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Based on the economic theory of dual structure, the authors of this study conducted an empirical analysis on the relationship between entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation using panel data collected in 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017. The study arrived at three conclusions. First, entrepreneurship in urban and rural areas can generally facilitate poverty alleviation. Second, the correlation between entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation in urban areas is significantly stronger than in rural areas. Moreover, the correlation is also significantly stronger in developed areas than in underdeveloped areas. Third, the level of financial development in an area can moderate the effect of entrepreneurship on poverty alleviation. These conclusions suggest that entrepreneurial activities in emerging economies have a stronger effect on alleviating poverty in urban regions instead of helping less developed or rural areas. The authors recommend that government agencies should institute policies aimed at vigorously improving the business environment in rural and underdeveloped areas. Particularly a strengthening of the financial system in these areas could further enhance the positive effect of entrepreneurship on poverty alleviation.

TI Child poverty and child support policy: A comparative analysis of
   Colombia and the United States
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Child support may merely reshuffle poverty, reducing child poverty among families who receive it at the expense of the economic well-being of children living with a nonresident parent. Our study examines child support's effects on child poverty, considering those who pay child support and those who receive child support, and doing so in Colombia and the United States (U.S.). We use data from the Colombian Longitudinal Survey (N = 13,036) and the U.S. Current Population Survey (N = 53,480). Our findings show that the antipoverty effectiveness of child support among resident parent families is larger in Colombia than in the U.S. Child support payments do increase child poverty among children living in payer families in both countries, but the effects are fairly small. In our base models, 6%-9% of children in nonresident parent families are falling into poverty after child support payments are transferred to other families. Overall, child support receipts decrease poverty to a greater extent than child support payments increase it among children.

TI Multidimensional poverty alleviation effect of different rural land
   consolidation models: A case study of Hubei and Guizhou, China
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Eradicating all forms of poverty is the goal of sustainable development in the world, and the problem of returning to poverty has received widespread attention from international organizations and various countries around the world. Rural land consolidation (RLC) has achieved sustainable land use by combining with land system reform and policy innovation, thus RLC has become an important means to consolidate the achievements of poverty eradication in China. Under the sustainable livelihood approach, this study reveals the pathways to alleviate multidimensional relative poverty of different RLC models. Based on questionnaire data of rural households from poor areas of Guizhou and Hubei provinces in China, this study constructs a multidimensional poverty indices (MPI), including five dimensions of relative poverty measurement indicators (income, education, livelihood, housing, and employment) and the corresponding critical values, and measures the multidimensional relative poverty status of rural households as well as the change before and after RLC. In addition, the effects of multidimensional poverty reduction of different RLC models on poor households were investigated by the quasi -experimental PSM-DID method. The results show that different RLC models exhibit different poverty reduction effects. A comprehensive analysis of the multidimensional relative poverty indices demonstrates that public -private partnership (PPP) model of RLC can significantly alleviate poverty status of rural household, whereas the government-led model has no significant multidimensional poverty reduction effects. The investigation of each of five dimensions reveals that the PPP model has a significant poverty reduction effect on all the five dimensions (income, education, livelihood, housing, and employment), but the government-led model has a significant poverty reduction effect only on income dimension. Accordingly, this study proposes related policy recommendations, which provides Chinese experience for other developing countries to formulate RLC poverty alleviation strategies.

TI Types and Optimization Paths Between Poverty Alleviation Effectiveness
   and Rural Revitalization: A Case Study of Hunan Province, China
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB Exploring the synergy types and optimization paths between Poverty Alleviation Effectiveness and Rural Revitalization is necessary for achieving the two centenary goals. Taking poverty alleviation counties in Hunan Province, China as an example, our study proposed an indicator to measure the synergistic development between Poverty Alleviation Effectiveness and Rural Revitalization using the multi-index integrated evaluation method. Then, the coupling types were classified based on both the proposed indicator and regional characteristics. Besides, the corresponding optimization path for each coupling type was proposed to promote the synergistic development of Poverty Alleviation and Rural Revitalization. Results are as follows: 1) Lower synergy focused on the southwestern Hunan, while low synergy is widely distributed (such as the west, southwest, northwest, and midland). Moderate synergy is in the midland, such as Huaihua and Chenzhou cities. High synergy is distributed in Yongzhou, Huaihua, Xiangxi cities, etc. Besides, only Hecheng City belongs to the higher synergy. 2) This paper proposes corresponding development paths for different development characteristics and main problems from multiple perspectives of the protection system, industrial planning, and rural market. Continuously consolidate and enhance the effectiveness of Poverty Alleviation and Rural Revitalization to achieve coupled and synergistic development of the two systems. Our research results can provide theoretical support for implementing Poverty Alleviation and Rural Revitalization in Hunan Province, China.

AB Educational poverty alleviation (resettlement) project has been fully implemented in Hainan province since 2008 and has made remarkable achievements in recent years. However, Hainan province is still facing challenges in poverty alleviation. There are still five national-level poverty counties with a total population of 1.147 million and there are four minority nationality autonomous counties in which. Poor people in Hainan province are mostly distributed in the harsh natural conditions in remote mountainous areas. Residents of low educational level and frequently affected by natural disasters are easy to back into poverty condition in these areas. With implementation of education poverty (resettlement) project since 2008, the people's government of Hainan province invested a total capital of 867.6 million yuan (RMB), newly constructed or reconstructed/ extended 37 schools and added better study rooms for 35,000 students. Hainan educational poverty alleviation (resettlement) project, which is a combination of resettlement and poverty alleviation and development of an educational poverty alleviation and ecological protection and both a fundamental solution to the problem of poverty and the effective protection of the ecology of an innovative anti-poverty project, is a "hematopoietic" poverty alleviation mode in minority nationality areas and ecological protection areas, which achieved good results in the region practice and has great promotion of significance.

TI Financial deepening and poverty reduction in Zambia: an empirical
   investigation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the inter-temporal causal relationship between financial sector development and poverty reduction in Zambia. The paper attempts to answer one critical question: does financial sector development in Zambia lead to poverty reduction?
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the newly developed autoregressive distributed lag-bounds testing procedure, which has numerous advantages, especially when the sample size is small. In addition, the paper uses three proxies of financial development, namely broad money supply (M2/GDP), domestic credit to the private sector as a ratio of gross domestic product (DCP/GDP) and domestic money bank assets ( DMBA), against private per capita consumption, a proxy for poverty reduction.
   Findings - When the broad money supply ratio (M2/GDP) is used as a proxy for financial sector development, poverty reduction seems to cause the development of the financial sector. However, when the DCP and the DMBA are used, financial development seems to cause poverty reduction, and not the other way round.
   Practical implications - The empirical results of this paper show that the causal relationship between financial development and poverty reduction is sensitive to the choice of proxy used for financial development.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind to empirically examine the causal relationship between financial deepening and poverty reduction in Zambia using modern econometrics techniques.

TI Optimal subsidy reduction strategies for photovoltaic poverty
   alleviation in China: A cost-benefit analysis
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The subsidy policies for photovoltaic poverty alleviation project in China need an urgent reform because this project is not only more dependent on subsidies but also inefficient in using subsidies. To relieve financial difficulties, we construct the investment benefit evaluation model for photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects. By classifying the resource areas into four types, a novel cost-benefit index for centralized poverty alleviation projects under different subsidy reduction schemes is calculated. Then, a comparative analysis is conducted for scenarios with or without value-added tax (VAT) preferential policy. We also discuss the selection of subsidy reduction strategies for targeted poverty alleviation using photovoltaic power. We find that: i) reducing installed capacity cost per unit is an optimal strategy to improve the profitability of photovoltaic poverty alleviation project. ii) The VAT preferential policy, which can be used a collocated policy, will improve the profitability of photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects. iii) At present, a complete withdrawal of subsidies is not feasible. However, under the VAT preferential policy, cutting down the subsidy by 50% once is theoretically possible. iv) The subsidy for photovoltaic poverty alleviation cannot adopt "one-size-fits all approaches" in all regions. A subsidy reduction policy is preferred for the Type I and Type II resource areas.

AB In this study, we analyze the spatial effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on poverty reduction in Vietnam. This study uses the provincial-level panel data and the fixed-effects regression and the spatial econometric model to investigate empirically the impact of FDI on poverty reduction in Vietnam. The study finds that FDI has contributed to poverty reduction not only directly but also indirectly through human capital. However, FDI has indirectly worsened poverty through international trade. In addition, empirical results from the spatial econometric model show that FDI tends to decrease poverty in provinces. Finally, the study has some policy implications to decrease the negative effects of FDI on poverty reduction in Vietnam.

TI Research on the Efficiency Measurement and Spatial Spillover Effect of
   China's Regional E-Commerce Poverty Alleviation from the Perspective of
   Sustainable Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The development of e-commerce plays a very important role in changing the production and operation mode, optimizing the allocation of market resources, promoting sustainable development, and ultimately achieving the goal of e-commerce poverty alleviation. Therefore, the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation has become a focus of attention for both the government and academia. The authors of this paper selected the panel data of 30 provinces and cities in China from 2010 to 2021, in order to measure the poverty alleviation efficiency of e-commerce in each province and city. We used the Moran's I index to measure its spatial correlation to verify the existence of its spatial effect; we then used the spatial Durbin model to analyze the spatial spillover effect in the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation. The conclusions are as follows: First, there is a significant positive spatial correlation of the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation among different regions in China. Moran's I index exceeds 0.5, indicating that there is a significant spatial effect in the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation, and the existence of its spatial effect is unavoidable in the empirical analysis. Secondly, from the perspective of the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation in various regions of the country, the overall e-commerce poverty alleviation efficiency is not high, and there are large differences among regions. The regions in which efficiency is higher include Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. Regionally, the highest are in the east and the lowest are in the west. Secondly, from the decomposition of spatial spillover effects, the direct effects of each influencing factor are all positive. Only the financial development environment is less significant, and the indirect effects indicate that only four indicators have significant spatial spillover effects, of which the most significant is industrial agglomeration. The level of industrial agglomeration is not significantly related to the level of human capital, and there is a negative correlation between it and the efficiency of e-commerce poverty alleviation. The authors studied the poverty alleviation efficiency and spatial spillover effect of China's regional e-commerce from the perspective of sustainable development, which is beneficial to China's regional poverty alleviation results, providing practical guidance and decision-making reference for implementing differentiated coping strategies in different regions. The research complements, improves, and expands the research content in this field.

TI Does engaging in government initiated corporate social responsibility
   activities improve corporate innovation? Evidence from China
SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The Chinese government initiated a nationwide poverty alleviation campaign in 2016. Many Chinese listed firms engaged in poverty alleviation campaign and made significant contributions. In this study, we investigate the relationship between firms' poverty alleviation campaign and firm innovation performance. Using a large sample of 3140 Chinese A-share listed firms on Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2019, this study demonstrates that firms' poverty alleviation campaign contribute to the improvement of firm innovation performance. These results are more pronounced for firms with higher internet search volume. Overall, our findings provide important support for listed firms to engage in CSR activities initiated by government.

TI Financial inclusion and extreme poverty in the MENA region: a gap
   analysis approach
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Purpose Eradicating extreme poverty remains one of the most significant and challenging sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. The latest World Bank statistics from 2018 show that extreme poverty in MENA increased from 2.6% to 5% between 2013 and 2015. MENA ranks third among developing regions for extreme poverty and fell short of halving extreme poverty by 2015 - the target established by the United Nations' (UN) millennium development goals, the precursor to the SDGs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of financial inclusion on extreme poverty for a sample of 34 countries over the period 1990-2017. Design/methodology/approach Using system general method of moments dynamic panel estimation methodology on annual data for 11 MENA countries and 23 emerging markets (EMs) over the period 1990 - 2017, this study begins by estimating the impact of financial inclusion - using measures of access and usage - on the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030, the first goal of the SDGs. Findings The results of the study indicate that, on one hand, financial access measures have a positive, statistically significant impact on reducing extreme poverty for the full sample and the MENA region. The second part of the study uses a gap analysis against four poverty targets - 0%, 1.5%, 3% and 5% - and shows that no MENA country and few EM countries will be able to close the extreme poverty gap and reach the target of 0% by 2030 by depending solely on improvements in financial access. These targets are based on the two benchmarks set by the World Bank and the UN, with intermediaries to capture error and give a fuller picture of what is possible. However, if improvements in financial inclusion alone can bring every EM and MENA country except Djibouti and Romania to bring the most accessible target of reducing global extreme poverty to no more than 5% by 2030. Originality/value While research on poverty reduction in the region tends to focus on financial development and governance, less attention has been paid to the role of financial inclusion. SDG 1 - eliminating poverty in all its forms - explicitly highlights the importance of access to financial services. Indeed, evidence from Argentina, India, Kenya, Malawi, Niger and other countries demonstrates the ways in which financial inclusion can impact poverty (Klapper, El-Zoghbi and Hess, 2016). When people are included in the financial system, they are better able to improve their health, invest in education and business and make choices that benefit their entire families. Financial inclusion advances governments, too: introducing vast segments of the population into the financial system by digitizing social transfers, for example, can cut government costs and reduce leakage, with benefits that ripple across society. Yet, the links between financial inclusion and poverty reduction in MENA are less established. This study aims to analyze the importance of financial inclusion in addressing extreme poverty by 2030, the year UN member states set as a target for achieving the SDGs.

TI Eliminating deprivation and breaking through dependence: A mechanism to
   help poor households achieve sustainable livelihoods by targeted poverty
   alleviation strategy
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB Deprivation and dependence are the main signs of poverty, and elimination of both constitutes a major means of poverty alleviation. The foremost goal of China's targeted poverty alleviation strategy (TPAS) and the sustainable livelihood analysis framework (SLAF) was thus the elimination of deprivation and dependence. Together, TPAS and SLAF form a poverty alleviation mechanism that provides an opportunity to conduct a systematic analysis of TPAS implementation that achieved world-renowned results in poverty alleviation. In this study, we comprehensively compare the changes in households and villages in a poor county before and after the implementation of TPAS; furthermore, we use a multilevel model to analyze the mechanism behind the functioning of the "Household-Village" multilevel structure in the poverty alleviation process. The TPAS implemented a comprehensive livelihood system for poor households, whereby multidimensional deprivation was eliminated by supplementing livelihood capitals. Acquisition-oriented assistance policies were offered to different groups to build customized paths of poverty alleviation, which ultimately helped poor households break through poverty and achieve sustainable livelihoods. This study highlights the close connection between the various components of the livelihood system, provides new research ideas for the study of China's TPAS and presents a reference template for the promotion of China's poverty alleviation programs.

AB Since the introduction of the e-commerce poverty alleviation, e-commerce poverty alleviation has been carried out in the counties. Luotian County is a demonstration county in e-commerce poverty alleviation, which is at the forefront of poverty reduction counties in Hubei Province. Playing the leading role of the county level government, Luotian County established the e-commerce industrial park and the village-level service station, developed the e-commerce industry and opened up the rural logistics. Giving full play to the main role of the market, the county also focused on developing agricultural industrialization enterprises, expanded sales channels with e-commerce, drove the development of featured industries, promoted the growth of the industrial chain, and shared the benefits of the poor households. Besides, it also promoted e-commerce tourism and helped poverty-stricken families get rid of poverty. The paper mainly analyzes the main practice and achievements of e-commerce in Luotian County and summarizes the experience of Luotian e-commerce in poverty alleviation, with a view to providing reference for other counties and regions.

TI Economic Policy Reform & Poverty Alleviation: A Critique of Nigeria's
   Strategic Plan for Poverty Reduction
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB Given the natural and human resources of Nigeria, it is believed that Nigeria has the potential to become the richest nation in Africa. Presently, however, it is estimated that about 70% of the Nigerian population lives in poverty. President Obasanjo, in his second term as the elected President of Nigeria, launched the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy ('NEEDS'). NEEDS is the Nigerian economic recovery plan for poverty alleviation and sustainable development. This study is a careful analysis of 'NEEDS' and its implementation in order to discover the extent to which the stated goal of poverty reduction has been achieved in the country. Unfortunately, this study has discovered that because of the apparent disconnect between the government and the poor, and the dichotomy between the rich and the poor, NEEDS appears to be a colossal failure in terms of poverty reduction.

TI The Impact of Adult Incarceration on Child Poverty: A County-Level
   Analysis, 1995-2007
SO PRISON JOURNAL
AB Traditionally, research on the tremendous variation in the use of incarceration across time and space has focused on the issue of whether imprisoning more offenders reduces crime. More recently, research has begun to explore the collateral consequences of mass incarceration for the families and communities of those imprisoned. The current study adds to this burgeoning literature by examining the impact of incarceration rates on child poverty rates. Employing a panel design for North Carolina county data, 1995-2007, we use instrumental variable techniques to disentangle the effect of incarceration on poverty from the effect of poverty on incarceration. The results indicate that mass incarceration has significantly increased child poverty rates. The impact of adult incarceration on child poverty appears especially pronounced in counties with a high proportion of non-White residents.

TI WHAT WORKS ? PREVENTING AND REDUCING CHILD POVERTY IN EUROPE
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SECURITY
AB In most EU Member States children are at an above-average risk of living in poverty. Financial poverty is oft en only one aspect of a complex disadvantaged life situation that impacts on the development of children and limits their chances for participation. A growing number of EU Member States now recognise child poverty as a fundamental social problem and try to reduce high levels of child poverty. The European Commission explicitly supports and coordinates these efforts within the Open Method of Coordination. The examples of countries that are successful in either reducing high levels (like the UK) or in maintaining low levels of child poverty (like Sweden) show that the reduction of child poverty is not just a by-product of general anti-poverty policies but demands an explicit, multi-dimensional and integrated strategy. This should be based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As the fullest international expression of children's fundamental rights it offers a framework for the development, implementation and monitoring of child-related policies across Europe. The analysis of child-and family related policies in six EU Member States and the United States shows considerable diversity across these countries. Different welfare traditions have led to different strengths and weaknesses in addressing poverty and social exclusion among children, so they require different policy bundles to tackle child poverty and promote child well-being.

AB Purpose - Poverty reduction remains one of the main goals of development efforts, as evidenced by the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals by most developing countries and international agencies. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between trade (exports) and employment and how the relationship reduces poverty through the instrumentality of employment, with a focus on Nigeria.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of descriptive analysis.
   Findings - Evaluating the case for Nigeria, the authors find that oil exports which drives economic growth do not provide the needed employment to reduce poverty, while agricultural trade, particularly exports, are capable of reducing poverty and inequality in Nigeria through the channel of employment and agricultural productivity growth.
   Originality/value - The paper makes a link between export trade, employment and poverty reduction in Nigeria.

TI The Measurement and Temporal and Spatial Evolution of Tourism Poverty
   Alleviation Efficiency in the Liupan Mountain Area of Gansu Province,
   China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Poverty is a chronic problem all over the world. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in 2012, the Chinese government has continuously increased its poverty alleviation efforts. In addition, absolute poverty in China was eliminated by the end of 2020. Tourism has played an important role in poverty alleviation. To explore the role of the tourism industry in reducing poverty, this paper takes the Liupan Mountain area of Gansu Province in western China, as a case site. An input-output evaluation index system was constructed, and a Super-SBM model was used to evaluate the tourism poverty alleviation efficiency in 40 districts and counties in the Liupan Mountain area from 2009 to 2018. The results show that the overall starting point of tourism poverty alleviation efficiency in the study area was high, which needed to be further optimized. The difference in tourism poverty alleviation efficiency among districts and counties tended to decrease in the time series. The restrictive factors were the lack of technological progress and lack of innovation. The spatial distribution of tourism poverty alleviation efficiency in the study area presented a pattern of high in the east and low in the west, high in the north and low in the south. In the future, the tourism poverty alleviation efficiency in the concentrated and contiguous destitute areas of the Liupan Mountain area in Gansu Province could be improved by cultivating the tourism industry, strengthening technological innovation, cultivating core growth poles, and exerting radiation effects.

TI Determinants of the disclosure tone of poverty alleviation information:

SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Companies' disclosing information of targeted poverty alleviation in China has become a referee for investors to judge the morality of the corporate management and influenced the decision-making of investment. According to analysing the sample of A-share listed companies in China's Shanghai and Shenzhen during 2016-2019, this article tests the effects on practices (Investment of Poverty Alleviation) via theories (Information Disclosure).
   The empirical result shows that: First, once companies invest more in targeted poverty alleviation, they will significantly increase their active tone, such as active participation and high involvements, to disclose the relevant information. Second, compared with private enterprises, state-owned enterprises will have more active tones in disclosing the information on targeted poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, with the non-profit feature and its social responsibility of state-owned enterprises, results reveal the negative correlations between increasing expenditures in poverty alleviation and its information disclosure.

The research perspectives, methods, and subject integration of studies on poverty reduction have been greatly developed with the advance of practice in the 21st century. This paper analyses 2,459 papers on poverty reduction since 2000 using VOSviewer software and R language. Our conclusions show that (1) the 21st century has seen a sharp increase in publications of poverty reduction, especially the period from 2015 to date. (2) The divergence in research quantity and quality between China and Kenya is great. (3) Economic studies focus on inequality and growth, while environmental studies focus on protection and management mechanisms. (4) International cooperation is usually related to geographical location and conducted by developed countries with developing countries together. (5) Research on poverty reduction in different regions has specific sub-themes. Our findings provide an overview of the state of the research and suggest that there is a need to strengthen the integration of disciplines and pay attention to the contribution of marginal disciplines to poverty reduction research in the future.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in recent years of Malaysia and Nigeria has not reflected in the poverty alleviation efforts from the governments of both countries. The need to review the past policies on poverty alleviation in these developing nations prompted this paper. Using secondary data sources, the poverty alleviation policy in Malaysia has made significant progress, while Nigeria is still struggling. Interestingly, after decades of poverty alleviation policies, Malaysia has been moving forward steadily although there are identifiable challenges to overcome while in Nigeria, the policies seems to have no progress due to lack of political will.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILDRENS RIGHTS
AB Against the context of limited research in Zimbabwe on rights-focused child poverty research, policy and practice, this study employs the Bristol Approach to measure the extent and relationship with gender and location, respectively, of child poverty among children aged five years and below (N = 6418). Using Zimbabwe's 2015 Demographic and Health Survey secondary data, 14 selected measures are tested for validity, reliability and additivity. Severe deprivation estimates are developed, showing the commonest deprivation forms as early childhood development (78 per cent), water (46 per cent), healthcare (44 per cent), sanitation (40 per cent), shelter (30 per cent) and nutrition (13 per cent). While boys and girls are similarly severely deprived, children in rural areas are the most severely deprived. While all deprivations are non-significantly correlated with gender, most are significantly correlated with location. Overall, the study highlights the extreme nature of child rights violations caused by poverty in Zimbabwe, and how rights-based child poverty measurement can better inform policy and practice responses.

TI Measuring Child Poverty in Hong Kong: Sensitivity to the Choice of
   Equivalence Scale
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB In September 2013, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region established Hong Kong's first official poverty line. The new poverty line is used as a major yardstick in social welfare policy formulation and in the allocation of public resources aimed at combating poverty; despite its importance, however, its robustness has not been examined. Using data from the 2011 Population Census, we examined the robustness of the official poverty line in measuring child poverty in Hong Kong through assessing the sensitivity of child poverty measures to the choice of different equivalence scales. The results show that the child poverty profile in Hong Kong is generally not sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale and that the official poverty line correctly identifies those children who live in poverty. Rates of child poverty among boys and girls of different ages, with different family backgrounds and living in households with different compositions, were calculated and ranked using different equivalence scales; these rankings were found to be very similar to those yielded by the official poverty measure. Thus, the choice of adult equivalence scale does not favour any subgroup. We also examined the child poverty profile in Hong Kong based on the official poverty measure and with our 2011 census data. We found that the children in our sample were more likely than the adults to live in poverty household; that more than half of the children who lived in poverty belonged to working poor families; and that children living in public housing were particularly likely to suffer from severe poverty. In light of these findings, we urge the government to prioritise taking measures aimed at lifting children out of poverty.

TI Green, poverty reduction and spatial spillover: an analysis from 21
   provinces of China
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environment and poverty are the focus of global concern, and green poverty reduction is China's strategic choice to deal with these two major problems. However, due to the vast territory, there are regional differences in environment and poverty in China. On the basis of this, selecting renewable resource utilization, environmental protection, and incidence of poverty as measurement indicators from two dimensions of green and poverty reduction, this paper employed the analysis of spatial autocorrelation and spatial econometric regression based on dynamic spatial Durbin model to explore the internal mechanism of green and poverty in rural areas of 21 provinces in China. The results show that there was a significant spatial autocorrelation in the poverty in rural areas among provinces, which shows that poverty reduction has significant regional connections within spatial scopes. Meanwhile, it is green that has a spatial spillover effect on poverty reduction. Therefore, on the one hand, intergovernmental governments should establish effective communication and cooperation mechanisms between regions; on the other hand, intergovernmental governments should pay enough attention to the spatial spillover effects of green on poverty reduction in green poverty reduction, so as to promote green poverty reduction to achieve overall and sustainable development.

   framework
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB This paper aims to contribute to the academic research on tourism and poverty alleviation, by providing an integrated research framework on the impacts of tourism on poverty. First, a conceptual discussion is presented in order to understand the potential of tourism to reduce poverty, as well as different approaches to promoting a direct link between tourism and poverty alleviation. Second, empirical studies published between 1999 and July 2014 were critically analysed in order to generate an empirical research framework that embraces the following issues: geographical scope, level of analysis, tourism context, study methods and poverty measure. Moreover, an integrative discussion of the empirical evidence regarding the contribution of tourism to poverty reduction is included. The proposed framework, which is intended to be useful for guiding future empirical research in this field, suggests associations between tourism initiatives, the poverty rate and the economic, socio-cultural and environmental conditions of the poor.

Using descriptive statistical analysis and will be displayed on the scatter plot. We found that the government budget for education, health, road infrastructure and the internet had a negative relationship. It means that increasing budget for infrastructure can reduce poverty rate. While, government budgets for electricity have a positive relationship. It means, raising the electricity budget can increase the poverty rate.

TI Levers for alleviating poverty in forests
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB An extensive set of policies, programmes, technologies and strategies have been implemented in the forest sector. Collectively, these 'levers' cover a diverse range of approaches, at a variety of scales and are governed by many different stakeholders. It is important for decision-makers to understand which levers might be most useful in achieving poverty alleviation. This paper seeks to answer the question: which forest management policies, programmes, technologies and strategies have been effective at alleviating poverty? We studied 21 different rights-based, regulatory, market and supply chain, and forest and tree management levers for which we could identify a plausible theory of change of how implementation of that lever might alleviate poverty. For every lever we: define and describe the lever; describe the logic or theory of change by which the lever might plausibly be expected to alleviate poverty; summarize the available evidence showing how the lever has alleviated poverty; and discuss the variables that explain heterogeneity in outcomes. Overall, we found limited evidence of these levers being associated with reducing poverty (i.e. moving people out of poverty). Some of the strongest evidence for poverty reduction came from ecotourism, community forest management, agroforestry and, to a lesser extent, payments for ecosystem services (PES). However, we found substantial, varied and context-dependent evidence of several levers being associated with mitigating poverty (i.e. by improving well-being). A multitude of cases showing positive outcomes for poverty mitigation came from community forest management, forest producer organisations, small and medium forest enterprises, PES, and tree crop contract production. A combination of more rigorous and long-term research designs, along with examinations of the cost-effectiveness of different levers, would go a long way to contributing to the design of effective interventions for poverty alleviation.

TI Social Transfers and Child Poverty in European Countries: Pro-poor
   Targeting or Pro-child Targeting?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
AB Children are generally at a higher risk of poverty than the population as a whole, although the mechanisms that lead to their socio-economic vulnerability vary widely across European countries. This paper aims to further our understanding of to what extent cross-country variations in child poverty risk are associated with different ways of social transfer targeting: pro-poor versus pro-child targeting. In particular, we address the potential impact on child poverty of countries' intent to target transfers at lower incomes and children across 30 European countries. Using a multilevel framework, we find that not only the size of the transfer system, but also the form of targeting matters in reducing child poverty. Specifically, the countries' intent to target children matters even more than their intent to target lower incomes, in terms of reducing child poverty. Moreover, the prevalence of multi-generational households in a country seems to be associated with an attempt to protect against child poverty in countries with lower levels of pro-child targeting.

TI Reducing child poverty and assessing targeting performance: Governmental
   cash transfers in Taiwan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
AB In this study, we focused on child poverty and examined the targeting performance of governmental cash benefits in Taiwan, and whether they successfully alleviate child poverty when budget constraints are imposed. We employed data from the cross-sectional Survey of Family Income and Expenditure 2010, which was conducted by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan. We investigated efficiency and effectiveness, using the IRIS, Beckerman, and Shapley approaches, to measure targeting performance. The results suggest that few transfer programmes perform well in terms of both target efficiency and effectiveness; this generates trade-offs and paradoxes between efficiency or effectiveness, undercoverage or leakage, vertical or horizontal efficiency, and universal or selective benefits. We conclude by suggesting social policy implications based on the findings. Key Practitioner Message: . Using different approach (targeting performance) to analyse child poverty; . Using targeting efficiency and effectiveness to analyse whether governmental cash benefits ameliorate child poverty given specific budget constraints.

TI Well-Designed Food Governance as Psychological Mechanism of Consumer
   Perceptions in the Context of Tourism Poverty Alleviation
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Poverty is a challenge leading to food insecurity in people's minds. This article discusses food governance as a psychological mechanism to facilitate the sense of wellness in people's minds in the context of tourism poverty alleviation. Mainly, we argue that, when a government is implementing tourism poverty alleviation, not only are economic efforts, but also positive psychological feelings are required. We, thus, argue that sound food governance may increase the sense of wellness in the minds of people as food consumers by increasing food safety and security. This perspective paper contributes by explicating the influences of macrolevel governance design of safer and more secure food systems on people's psychological wellness, especially against the background of tourism poverty alleviation in developing countries.

TI Financial inclusion and poverty alleviation: an empirical examination
SO ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING
AB This study analyzes the impact of financial inclusion on poverty reduction in 156 countries belonging to different income groups during the 2004-2019 period. We construct a novel composite financial inclusion index and apply both static and dynamic panel estimation methods to examine the impact of financial inclusion on two different poverty levels. Our results indicate that financial inclusion has a significant negative association with extreme poverty in developing countries but not in high-income countries. The effect of financial inclusion on moderate poverty is weaker than that on extreme poverty. We also examine the conditional relationship between gender inequality and financial inclusion, finding that improvement in gender inequality enhances the effect of financial inclusion on both extreme and moderate poverty in developing countries. The effectiveness of financial inclusion is influenced by how equally the disadvantaged groups, particularly women, can access and utilize financial services. Our findings suggest that policymakers can use financial inclusion as a poverty reduction tool.

TI Prevalence and correlates of multidimensional child poverty in India
   during 2015-2021: A multilevel analysis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Despite increasing research and programs to eradicate poverty, poverty still exists and is a far greater concern for children than adults, leading child poverty to become a political, economic, and social issue worldwide and in India. The current study aims to find variations in the prevalence of child poverty and associated factors in India during 2015-21. In the current study, we used two consecutive rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015-16 & NFHS-5, 2019-21) to estimate child poverty (aged 0-59 months) using the Alkire-Foster method. The multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to find the important cofounder and cluster level variation in child poverty. The results show that about 38 percent of children were multidimensionally poor in 2015-16, which reduced to 27 percent in 2019-21. The decomposition analysis suggests that contribution of nutrition domain to child poverty increases over time, whereas the standard of living substantially declines from NFHS-4 to NFHS-5. The multilevel analysis results show that the age and sex of the child, age and years of schooling of the mother, children ever born, religion, caste, wealth quintile and central, northeast, north and west regions are significantly associated with child poverty over time. Further, the variance participation coefficient statistics show that about 12 percent of the variation in the prevalence of child poverty could be attributed to differences at the community level. The prevalence of child poverty significantly declines over time, and the community-level variation is higher than the district-level in both surveys. However, the community-level variation shows increases over time. The finding suggests a need to improve the nutritional status and standard of living of most deprived households by promoting a child-centric and dimension-specific approach with more focus on PSU-level intervension should adopt in order to lessen child poverty in India.

TI Sizing Up Transport Poverty Alleviation: A Structural Equation Modeling
   Empirical Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
AB The aim of this paper was to systematically obtain the poverty reduction effects and diversified poverty alleviation paths of road infrastructure, to assist in the planning of transport poverty alleviation and rural revitalization in the concentrated contiguous poverty-stricken areas. The measurement methods for impact effects and paths of transport poverty alleviation have been scientifically proposed based on methods of transportation economics and transportation geography. Firstly, an overview of the interactive mechanism and processes by which road infrastructure investment influences poverty reduction has been offered, and the characteristics of poverty space and spatial coupling result of road infrastructure have been systematically obtained. The results show that about 70% of the district counties' road infrastructure and poverty rate are in a state of spatial coupling imbalance; the coordinated synchronous type is mainly distributed along the road network. Secondly, the structural equation model system has been formulated with variables that reflect transportation input in adjacent geographical units to consider spatial spillover effects. The results show that the direct poverty reduction effect of road infrastructure (0.105) is much lower than the indirect poverty reduction effect (0.830). Thirdly, empirical analysis at regional level of the concentrated contiguous poverty-stricken areas in China has been conducted. As a result, while addressing the limitations of previous studies, the poverty alleviation path that has been proposed also aims to catalyze actions to reduce the transport-related exclusion in poverty-stricken areas caused by the lack of access to basic facilities.

SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB Ecotourism has become a sustainable alternative to degrading livelihoods around protected areas in developing countries. Its contributions to poverty reduction are captured in terms of employment and income generation. As a result, studies assessing ecotourism's contributions have traditionally focused on the accumulation and distribution of the economic benefits. However, little attention has been given to the non-economic aspects relevant to poverty reduction. Using the livelihood approach, this article aims at assessing ecotourism impacts on the livelihoods of households. The results indicate that ecotourism contributes to reducing poverty, however, this can be enhanced by focusing on the non-economic aspects and minimizing its negative impacts on household livelihood.

TI The Importance of Choice and Definition for the Measurement of Child
   Poverty-the case of Vietnam
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Increased attention to childrens' special position within poverty measurement resulted in the development of various child poverty approaches in the last decade. Analysis shows that their development processes involve a similar set of steps and decisions, predominantly taken in the same sequence. However, it also becomes apparent that many of these decisions are made implicitly rather than explicitly, resulting in unclear and non-transparent underlying constructs. Consequently, child poverty approaches often lack a solid and robust foundation and are misinterpreted and misunderstood when used for analytical and policy purposes. This paper distills a generic construction process from the analysis of existing child poverty approaches, presenting a tool for clear and transparent development of such approaches. It is then applied to the case of Vietnam, using household survey data, to illustrate its practical use and develop a Vietnam-specific child poverty approach. Findings suggest that 37% of all children are poor, whilst observing a large rural-urban divide but no significant differences between boys and girls.

TI Child Poverty: The United Kingdom Experience
SO ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS
AB The United States has long struggled with high levels of child poverty. In 2014, 2 of 5 (42.9%) of all American children lived in economically insecure households and just over 1 in 5 children lived below the official absolute poverty line. These rates are high, but not intractable. Evidence from the US Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure, among other sources, shows the effect that public investments in cash and noncash transfers can have in reducing child poverty and improving child well-being. However, with significant disparities in services and supports for children across states and the projected decline of current federal spending on children, the United States is an international outlier in terms of public investments in children, particularly compared with other high-income nations. One such country, the United Kingdom (UK), faced similar child poverty challenges in recent decades. At the end of the 20th century, the British Prime Minister pledged to halve child poverty in a decade and eradicate it 'within a generation.' The Labour Government then set targets and dedicated resources in the form of income supplements, employment, child care, and education support. Child poverty levels nearly halved against an absolute measure by the end of the first decade. Subsequent changes in government and the economy slowed progress and have resulted in a very different approach. However, the UK child poverty target experience, 15 years in and spanning multiple changes in government, still offers a useful comparative example for US social policy moving forward.

TI A Multifaceted Intervention with Savings Incentives to Reduce
   Multidimensional Child Poverty: Evidence from the Bridges Study
   (2012-2018) in Rural Uganda
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Using a randomized controlled trial design, we examine the effects of savings incentives (match rate 1:1 versus 1:2) with mentorship and financial trainings on child poverty among 1383 orphaned children (mean age 12.7 years at baseline) in rural Uganda. Given the difficulty to capture child poverty using monetary measures, we use a multidimensional class of poverty that captures four dimensions: health, assets, housing, and behavioral risks. Results show that children in treatment groups experienced reductions in poverty incidence by 10 percentage points (or deprivation score by 8 percent) relative to control group counterparts at four years post-baseline, and a higher savings incentive led to stronger effects. Further, children in treatment groups were more likely to escape the poverty trap. Finally, we assess the robustness of these results to various weighting structures. This study offers a unique evidence on effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention targeting children in alleviating poverty.

TI Minimum Wages, Globalization, and Poverty in Honduras
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB We test whether minimum wage legislation is an effective poverty reduction tool in a poor country trying to stay competitive in the global economy. In Honduras, increases in relatively high minimum wages lead to reductions in poverty, especially extreme poverty. However, the impact is felt only in households with workers in large firms and felt more strongly among those with low wage workers. Increases in the minimum do not affect poverty in sectors where minimum wages are not enforced or do not apply. Hence minimum wages can be a poverty reduction tool in the formal sector, which competes globally. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Research on Improving Online Purchase Intention of Poverty-Alleviation
   Agricultural Products in China: From the Perspective of
   Institution-Based Trust
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Poverty alleviation by consumption is a powerful way to help the poor people get rid of poverty, which plays a significant role in China's rural revitalization. However, the achievement of poverty alleviation by consumption mostly depends on government procurement, and the enthusiasm of customers to participate is low, facing the severe challenge of poor sustainability. Helping the poor is the most common motivation for customers to buy poverty-alleviation agricultural products (PAAP). However, as the negative events of poverty alleviation such as "tragic marketing" constantly appear in news reports, customers' trust in sellers has been seriously damaged. The psychological protection system for fear of being cheated hinders customers' purchase intention. Therefore, we believed that trust is an important factor in enhancing customers' purchase intention of PAAP. Customers buy PAAP mainly through online channels, and institution-based trust is the most important way to generate trust in online channels. Thus, this study investigated the institutional mechanisms that affect customers' trust in the sellers of PAAP and discussed the influence of trust on the online purchase intention of PAAP. Data were obtained through a questionnaire survey and tested empirically. The results showed that the effectiveness of the user feedback mechanism, platform supervision mechanism, product traceability mechanism, and product certification mechanism can enhance customers' purchase intention by enhancing their trust. Individual trust tendency positively regulated the relationship between the effectiveness of institutional mechanisms and consumer trust. The conclusion can not only provide new theoretical guidance for the practice of poverty alleviation by consumption in China but also offer new ideas for the poverty alleviation undertakings in other countries.

TI Has the Development of the Non-Timber Forest Products Industry Achieved
   Poverty Alleviation? Evidence from Lower-Income Forest Areas in Yunnan
   Province
SO FORESTS
AB Considering the notion that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets", the effective exploitation of the economic value of forest resources is an important research topic, especially in forest-rich areas. The development of the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) industry has promoted both ecological and economic benefits and has effectively improved farmers' incomes while protecting forest resources. In order to evaluate the effects of the NTFPs industry on sustaining farmers' livelihoods and protecting ecological environments, we constructed a performance evaluation index system to determine the poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry in Yunnan Province using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which covered three aspects: the achievement of poverty alleviation, the sustainability of poverty alleviation and satisfaction with poverty alleviation. Then, we selected Sanhe Village in Nujiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province, as an example to verify and rationalize the evaluation index system and comprehensively evaluate the poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry. Based on data from questionnaires and field interviews, we found the following: (1) the overall poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry in Sanhe Village was 79.33, which indicated that the effect was good; (2) the scores for the achievement of poverty alleviation, the sustainability of poverty alleviation and satisfaction with poverty alleviation were 50.56, 18.57 and 10.2, respectively; (3) there were some problems with the poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry, such as limited capital investments, the weak roles of cooperatives and enterprises, the low enthusiasm of lower-income households and incomplete poverty alleviation projects. Finally, we devised some suggestions that could improve the poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry. This paper presents the performance evaluation index system for the poverty alleviation performance of the NTFPs industry, which could provide a reference for evaluating the developmental effects of the NTFPs industry in other lower-income forest areas. Through our empirical analysis of the development effects of the NTFPs industry on farmers' livelihoods and ecological environments in Sanhe Village, we found that the development of the NTFPs industry significantly improved the farmers' livelihoods and ecological environments.

TI Is tourism pro-poor in India? An empirical investigation using ARDL
   approach
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between tourism sector development and poverty reduction in India using annual data from 1970 to 2018. The paper attempts to answer the critical question: Is tourism pro-poor in India? Design/methodology/approach Stationarity properties of the series are checked by using the ADF unit root test. The paper uses the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound testing approach to cointegration to examine the existence of long-run relationships; error-correction mechanism for the short-run dynamics, and Granger non-causality test to test the direction of causality. Findings The cointegration test confirms a long-run relationship between tourism development and poverty reduction for India. The ARDL test results suggest that tourism development and economic growth reduces poverty in both the long run and the short run. Furthermore, inflation had a negative and significant short-run impact on the poverty reduction variable. The causality test confirms that there is a positive and unidirectional causality running from tourism development to poverty reduction confirming that tourism development is pro-poor in India. Research limitations/implications This study implies that poverty in India can be reduced by tourism sector growth and price stability. For a fast-growing economy with respect to economic growth and tourism sector growth, this may have far-reaching implications toward inclusive growth in India. Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind to empirically examine the causal relationship between tourism sector development and poverty reduction in India using modern econometric techniques.

AB since the 19th CPC national congress, building a beautiful China has provided opportunities for the construction of beautiful villages and targeted poverty alleviation in western ethnic regions. The driving force for the construction of the beautiful villages is the new type of farmers in the new era. However, in western impoverished areas, farmers including impoverished households are not well-qualified at all presently. Educational poverty alleviation requires improvement in software such as educational public service level, during which the popularization and application of the common language - Mandarin has become a pressing issue for every citizen in Tibet to resolve.

TI The impact of rural land consolidation on household poverty alleviation:
   The moderating effects of human capital endowment
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Eradicating poverty is the primary goal for pursuing equitable and sustainable development of the world. Rural land consolidation (RLC) aims to achieve efficient and sustainable land use while promoting poverty alleviation. This study empirically examined the impact of RLC on multi-dimensional poverty, using the difference-indifferences (DID) method and survey data from impoverished households. Additionally, the role of human capital in moderating the impact of RLC on poverty alleviation is also emphasised. We found that (1) The RLC has had a positive and significant impact on the improvement of impoverished households' livelihoods in China. (2) Human capital (migrant worker, labour force, and education) has a positive moderating effect on the impact of RLC on poverty alleviation, and education exerts the most obvious moderating effect. We suggest that the Chinese government should not only continue to increase investment in and provide supporting policy for RLC, but also develop targeted RLC strategies. Education, labour capability, sustainable poverty reduction, sustainable land use, and sustainable rural development require sustained attention. It also could help to improve policy and decision-making for effective poverty reduction, sustainable rural development, and rural revitalisation.

The Social Development Approach (SDA)(1) was used together with the Child Focused Multi-dimensional Model (CFMDM)(2) to explore the research problem. A phenomenological research design was followed by conducting semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion with 20 participants who were purposively drawn from four urban and rural areas in the Eastern Cape. The findings concur with the view that the Child Support Grant (CSG)(3) monetary support should be increased to better accommodate the multi -dimensional child poverty needs of the CSG recipients.

TI Oh Canada! Too many children in poverty for too long
SO PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH
AB Despite continued economic growth, Canada's record on child poverty is worse than it was in 1989, when the House of Commons unanimously resolved to end child poverty by the year 2000. Most recent data indicate that nearly 1.2 million children - almost one of every six children - live in low-income households. Campaign 2000 contends that poverty and income inequality are major barriers to the healthy development of children, the cohesion Of Our Communities and, ultimately, to the social and economic well,being of Canada. Canada needs to adopt a poverty-reduction strategy that responds to the UNICEF challenge to establish credible targets and timetables to bring the child poverty rate well below 10%, as other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations have done. Campaign 2000 calls on the federal government to develop a cross-Canada poverty-reduction strategy in conjunction with the provinces, territories and First Nations, and in consultation with low-income people. This strategy needs to include good jobs at living wages that ensure that full-time work is a pathway out of poverty; an effective child benefit of $5,100 that is indexed; a system of affordable, universally accessible early learning and child care services available to all families irrespective of employment status; an affordable housing program that creates more affordable housing and helps to sustain existing stock; and affordable and accessible postsecondary education and training programs that prepare youth and adults for employment leading to economic independence.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFELONG EDUCATION

However, the dialectic between the concurrent and contradictory processes of 'poverty reduction' and 'poverty induction' is not well understood, and the historically rooted and globally entrenched larger structural processes of ' poverty induction' are indeed being allowed to advance and grow. Adult education over the lifespan, which relative to other sectors of education has the most important role to play in projects of poverty reduction worldwide, is regretfully the least supported by the policy elite. A new band of activist adult educators is needed, rich in intellect and imbued with commitment, joined in a system of adult lifelong education that is both comprehensive and commensurate with the tasks of constructing projects of poverty reduction in the short run, and of deconstructing ideologies and structures of poverty induction in the long run.

TI TARGETED POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK: EVIDENCE FROM
   CHINA
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Using manually collected samples on voluntary targeted poverty alleviation of 3418 Chinese firms for the period 2016-2019, we explore the impact of targeted poverty alleviation actions of listed companies on the stock price crash risk. Results show that listed companies participating in targeted poverty alleviation exhibited a lower risk of stock price crash risk; this conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness and endogeneity tests. This paper further explored its internal transmission routes. We found that the response of a public company to the targeted poverty alleviation policy will increase its positive coverages and plays the role of information intermediary and public supervision of media. Thus, the company's behavior of hiding bad news is curtailed, and its future stock price crash risk is significantly reduced. For the government, China's targeted poverty alleviation strategy is worthy of reference, while getting rid of poverty, the stock price crash risk of participating companies has also been effectively suppressed.

AB Brazilian social protection programs have had consistent effects in reducing poverty and inequality among their respective target-groups: children, adolescents and pregnant and breastfeeding women. In 2011, the Brazil without Extreme Poverty program was launched as a strategy to eradicate extreme poverty by 2014. It makes the promotion of rights the core concept of the official political narrative. This study seeks to provide a systematic description of the Brazil without Extreme Poverty program and its initial results. A review of official documents and academic studies on the social protection programs was conducted. The Brazil without Extreme Poverty program represents an incremental approach to the social protection policies enacted by the previous administration. It advocates a multidimensional and focused approach, funded primarily by the federal government. The strategy subscribes to the international trend of associating social protection with employment and income generation policies.

TI Measuring the effect of health on the income of people living in extreme
   poverty: A comparative cross-sectional analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Background Through a review of the literature, we have observed that existing studies primarily focus on defining and measuring poverty, identifying the factors that affect poverty, and proposing anti-poverty strategies. The impact of health on income in the context of extreme poverty has not been adequately studied. In China, 30 million people live below the poverty line, and poverty caused by illness accounts for nearly 44% of the total number of recorded incidents. Health impaired by disease has become the largest obstacle to escaping extreme poverty. Objective To determine whether health has a greater effect on the incomes of individuals in the extreme poverty group compared with the nonimpoverished group. Methods The poverty threshold of China in 2010 was adopted for the definition of extreme poverty. The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) Database 2014 was selected as the data source. Ordinary least squares (OLS) test was conducted to estimate the model, and the endogeneity of the variables was analyzed by the random effects model. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was used instead of body mass index (BMI) to perform the robustness test. Results We found that the influence of individual health conditions on income was augmented in the case of extreme poverty, which indicates that health indeed influences income more strongly for individuals in the extreme poverty group. Conclusions In addition to education, investment, and social security projects, further public policy attention should be given to the improvement of the health status of the extremely impoverished population.

TI POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN THE CONTEX OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IN
   INDONESIA
SO ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB Acceleration of poverty reduction in Indonesia is largely determined by the role of regional governments in implementing fiscal decentralization. Three indicators of fiscal decentralization were used to measure their effects on poverty reduction, i.e., regional government expenditures, regional government revenues, and intergovernmental transfers. This study investigated the panel data regression models for 33 provinces in Indonesia during 2010-2016. The results show that regional government revenues and intergovernmental transfers had a statistically significant effect on reducing poverty while regional government expenditures did not. This study confirms that in the context of fiscal decentralization in Indonesia, the increase of regional government revenues both from own source revenues and intergovernmental transfers appear to be more effective in encouraging poverty reduction than the increase of the total regional government expenditures. Therefore, it is very important for policymakers at the regional level to encourage the increase of regional revenues in order to create enough fiscal space to fund poverty alleviation programs on the one hand. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase the proportion of regional government expenditures to priority programs for poverty alleviation more than regional government operational expenditures.

TI Access To Extension And Poverty Alleviating Strategies of Farm Families
   In Adamawa State, Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB The strategies employed by farm families in alleviating poverty in the face of their level of access to extension information are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 120 household heads of farm families from Adamawa state. Results showed that 60 percent of the household heads have low access to extension information, with the most common sources being the VEAs (73%) and informal organizations (66%). The deregulation of the economy has affected expenditure on extension and thus reduced the number of extension agents.
   The results revealed that the poverty alleviating strategies employed by the respondents include cultivating several crops, trading, brewing of local drinks, leasing out of farmland and craft making. Results further showed no significant relationship between respondents' membership of informal organizations and the poverty alleviating strategies they employed while a significant relationship exist between respondents' access to extension and the poverty alleviating strategies they employed (X-2 = 3.68; p = 0.04). This indicated a linkage between respondents' access to extension and the poverty alleviating strategies they employed. There is therefore the need to improve the farm families' access to extension in effort at assisting them alleviate poverty.

TI Public capital investment, economic growth and poverty reduction in
   South African Municipalities
SO REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB This study examines the relationship between public-sector capital investment, economic growth and poverty reduction at a municipal level in South Africa between 2001 and 2011. While much progress has occurred since 1994, poverty and inequality remain key developmental challenges for the state. Despite tremendous spending in capital investment programmes over the last decade, it is unclear how much this investment has contributed to the improvement in the living conditions and poverty status of households. Panel regression was used to analyse this relationship and the results support the hypothesis that there is a strong and positive relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction. The study's findings indicate that economic growth plays a significant role in reducing poverty; a 1 per cent increase in GVA correlates to between a 1.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent decrease in poverty levels. However, the results indicated relatively large increases in capital investments only result in small poverty reductions. Thus, this study raises doubt about the use of capital investment as a tool towards achieving poverty reduction targets as set by the South African government.

TI Emergent Political Norms in Local State-Private Enterprise Relations
   during China's Big Push for Poverty Reduction
SO AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
AB In 2014, the Chinese government adopted a version of the controversial Big Push approach to poverty reduction, and augmented this once-discredited developmental narrative by enlisting very large private enterprises to operate in the poorest regions. Not without controversies, this approach and the resources associated with it has created new state-large business relations in China. This article studies four large enterprises and examines why they participated in poverty reduction, the resulting state-business relations and the outcomes of poverty reduction. The field research was conducted in 2018 through in depth interviews with company management and site visits. The findings show that the local state became collaborators of big businesses that were endorsed by the central government. Whether these relationships become formalised will depend on the future direction of poverty reduction. This research contributes to the literature on how state-business relations may initiate economic growth.

TI Global extreme poverty rates for children, adults and the elderly
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Chen and Ravallion's estimates of global extreme poverty rates are well known. This note, by considering how these rates vary by age group, reaches two important and policy relevant conclusions and emphasizes a central avenue for future research. The first is that child extreme poverty rates are 50% higher than adult ones and almost twice those of the elderly. This result depends on assuming that all individuals in a household have the same resource needs and no economies of scale exist, as in the World Bank standard approach. Conversely, if conservative estimates of economies of scale and individual discount factors are adopted, global extreme poverty rates and the child-adult gap are much smaller than the Chen and Ravallion estimates. These findings highlight the policy importance of research efforts towards understanding how needs vary within a household and with its size. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Selection of targeted poverty alleviation policies from the perspective
   of land resources-environmental carrying capacity
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB Selecting the appropriate targeted poverty alleviation policies and exploring the implementation path of refined poverty alleviation policies are important to provide support for achieving a comprehensive poverty alleviation for China in 2020. Two models, namely, land resources-environmental carrying capacity (LRECC) index and the coupling coordination degree (CCD), were established to quantitatively explore the important effects of differences in the LRECC in the production, living and ecological spaces on poverty, and determine the important role of superior carrying space in poverty alleviation. Additionally, this study explored the relationship between the poverty incidence and the LRECC by using of the coefficient of geographical association (CGA) to perform the priority and the optimal selection of targeted poverty alleviation policies from the production, living, and ecological spaces. Results showed that the comprehensive CGAs of Long Zhouping township, Huo Shaoping township and other townships were high; therefore, the priority of targeted poverty alleviation was high. By contrast, the comprehensive CGAs of Ya Zikou township, Du Zhenwan township, and other townships were low; thus, the priority of targeted poverty alleviation was low. Long Zhouping and Dayan townships should select the production aspect of targeted poverty alleviation policies, whereas Du Zhenwan and Ya Zikou townships and Gao Jiayan and Moshi townships should select the living and ecological aspects, respectively. Selecting the appropriate targeted poverty alleviation policies by quantitatively identifying the advantages of regional land resource endowment and the poverty incidence will help take the poor out of poverty, and do not become poor again, thereby achieving regional sustainable development.

TI Corporate social responsibility for poverty alleviation: An integrated
   research framework
SO BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB There is a growing demand by United Nations development agencies and governments for a higher engagement of firms in sustainable development goals, including that of eradicating poverty. Nevertheless, the social issue of poverty has not traditionally been covered by firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. In addition, there is a need to integrate theories in order to better explain pro-poor CSR in developing countries. Relying on a review of both conceptual and empirical research articles on CSR for poverty alleviation, this study contributes to the CSR research agenda by proposing an integrated research framework for assessing and explaining a firm's contribution to poverty alleviation. Besides discussing the existing evidence, the following issues are critically analysed with the general purpose of obtaining the framework and suggesting avenues for future research: the assessment of a firm's contribution to poverty alleviation, types of pro-poor CSR initiatives that could be adopted by firms, and the factors influencing a firm's contribution. The framework, which intends to be useful for future research, can also assist the United Nations to increase the firms' contribution to its alleviating poverty sustainable development goal.

TI How to Develop Sustainably after Poverty Alleviation in Poverty-Stricken
   Areas under Paired Assistance: A Quantitative Assessment Framework Based
   on System Dynamics Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The paired assistance approach is an important measure for achieving poverty alleviation in China. The sustainable development of poverty-stricken areas after poverty alleviation has become an important task in preventing a return to poverty and promoting rural revitalization. Paired assistance is a dynamic process of balanced economic, social, and population development. This study establishes a system dynamics (SD) model for developing poverty-stricken regions under paired assistance. This study takes Lvchun County in Yunnan Province as the research object, designates six scenarios, and simulates the development of Lvchun County from 2019 to 2035 to evaluate its sustainable development after poverty alleviation. The results show that the cessation of poverty alleviation funding will not increase the incidence of poverty under paired assistance but will lead to an unbalanced scenario of "poor people and a rich government". In the multi-scenario simulation, only by continuing the cooperation foundation formed by paired assistance and paying attention to the resource endowment of poverty-stricken areas can collaborative development be adopted to achieve sustainable development by 2030. This result may be a valuable resource for the world's underdeveloped regions to reference as they seek to eliminate poverty, reduce the risk of returning to poverty, and promote sustainable development.

By ratifying the Convention in 1991, Canada was obligated to advance the basic economic security rights of children under Article 27. A particular problem, as Canada recognized, was child poverty. In accord with the Convention, Canada took important measures to overcome the problem. However, child poverty has persisted as a serious problem, putting at risk the exercise of children's rights in ways that are more far-reaching than often thought.

TI Education and anti-poverty: Policy theory and strategy of poverty
   alleviation through education in China
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB Countries around the world have adopted different policies to address the global issue of poverty, though their poverty line varies. China has achieved remarkable results in poverty alleviation through education. Aware that poverty eradication must rely on intellectual support, the country has shifted its anti-poverty theory and policy actions from a passive, one-off poverty reduction mode based on blood transfusion' to an active and sustainable mode aimed at improving the blood making' capacity of the poor population, namely the Chinese mode. Education is the fundamental way of such a mode. China has always focused on nine-year compulsory education in implementing anti-poverty policies; conducted classified and tiered efforts in education against poverty and made policies more targeted; adopted diverse policy instruments and shifted the focus from subsidy to educational capacity building; developed quantified poverty alleviation indexes to set standards for policy evaluation; and included education against poverty into the national anti-poverty strategic plan. China will further advance poverty alleviation through education, and form a unique and effective anti-poverty mode, so as to contribute to the building of a community of shared future for all humankind.

TI How to Assess the Child Poverty and Distributional Impact of COVID-19
   Using Household Budget Surveys: An Application Using Turkish Data
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB This study presents a methodology to predict the child poverty impact of COVID-19 that can be readily applied in other country contexts where similar household data are available-and illustrates this case using data from Turkey. Using Household Budget Survey 2018, the microsimulation model estimates the impact of labour income loss on household expenditures, considering that some types of jobs/sectors may be more vulnerable than others to the COVID-19 shock. Labour income loss is estimated to lead to reductions in monthly household expenditure using an income elasticity model, and expenditure-based child poverty is found to increase in Turkey by 4.9-9.3 percentage points (depending on shock severity) from a base level of 15.4%. Among the hypothetical cash transfer scenarios considered, the universal child grant for 0-17 years old children was found to have the highest child poverty reduction impact overall, while schemes targeting the bottom 20-30% of households are more cost-effective in terms of poverty reduction. The microsimulation model set out in this paper can be readily replicated in countries where similar Household Budget Surveys are available.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB The Dabieshan area in China is rich in geodiversity, in terms of representative and comprehensive system of granite landscapes, with huge scientific value for studying the Phanerozoic orogenic belt magmatism, as well as aesthetic, recreational and cultural values for tourism. The importance of granite landscapes in Dabieshan was globally recognised when the Huanggang Dabieshan UNESCO Global Geopark (DBGG) was accepted in the Global Geoparks Network in 2018. With over 10 years of experience and a concerted effort to develop geotourism and alleviate poverty, the DBGG has followed a mature system of development, providing a well-developed example of successful geotourism and poverty alleviation in China. This study explores the current geotourism and geopark activities in relation to sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation in the DBGG and proposes expanding the geotourism industry, emphasising the cultivation of agricultural pillar industries and supporting policies and projects as an effective measure to alleviate poverty in the geopark area. Geodiversity, geotourism and geoparks exhibit essential credentials for poverty alleviation and sustainable rural development in the Dabieshan area. Through these effective measures and unremitting efforts, the DBGG has become a major tourist destination that can be used as a model for the development of geotourism and poverty alleviation.

TI Rights-Based Approach To Poverty Reduction: The Ghanaian Experience
SO FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The 1992 Constitution of the republic of Ghana obligates the state to guarantee that all citizens have access to social and economic livelihood. As a consequence, the government implemented the ongoing Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme in 2008 to sustain development in these areas. Although Ghana has achieved progress in reducing extreme poverty and hunger, there is considerable evidence of poverty and widening inequality across the country. This study draws on the theoretical lens of the human rights-based approach (HRBA) to poverty reduction to examine how the implementation of the LEAP programme aligns with beneficiaries' human rights entitlements. The findings suggest that the LEAP programme has led to some positive outcomes for beneficiaries, including enhanced self-esteem and happiness, household cohesion, social interaction and increased community involvement for beneficiaries. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that the implementation of the LEAP programme only partially aligns with the HRBA to poverty reduction, which potentially undermines efforts to eradicate poverty and sustain development in Ghana.

AB This article presents the first measurement of multidimensional child poverty at the regional level in East Asia and the Pacific and is based on child poverty studies in seven countries in the region: Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. It examines the prevalence of child poverty, as per the Bristol deprivation approach, in the seven countries, as well as the extent of various types of disparities within these countries. A composite measure, the Child Poverty Index, is also applied. Findings reveal that widespread and severe deprivation is being faced by children in one subset of countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR and Mongolia), while the other subset of countries (Philippines, Thailand, Vanuatu and Viet Nam) is confronted with pockets of deprived child populations and the issue of less severe deprivation. Alternative policy approaches to reduce child poverty in these two subsets of study countries are also discussed.

AB There has been a significant reduction in the number of desperately poor people in the world in recent years. A great deal of that reduction in poverty can be attributed in China. There is great potential for new insights for scholars, in looking more deeply into the Chinese experience in terms of entrepreneurship and poverty reduction. This paper employs an in-depth case study of how poverty was reduced through entrepreneurship and innovation in the eastern Chinese city of Yiwu. This study is a response to some scholars' call for more direct examination of businesses' involvement with the poor to shed new light on the emerging topic of the roles of business in poverty reduction. Moreover, this study reports on key factors, new insights, and experiences which have led to success in poverty reduction and contributes to theory and practice in this area.

SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments are closely associated with each other's dissipation structure, which contains various coordinated and noncoordinated coupling states. Based on the perspective of reverse thinking and problem diagnosis, this paper constructs a bridge from uncoordinated pathology to coordinated development. From the perspective of incongruity, the framework model and evaluation index system of tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments incongruity coupling coordination driving mechanism are constructed. Also, the variation coefficient method is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation index and the coupling relationship and evolution of tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments in Liupanshui city are analyzed by the noncoordination coupling function. The results suggest the following: (1) During the study period, the poverty alleviation level of tourism in Liupanshui city presents a continuous growth curve. Meanwhile, ecological environment development level depicts rapid growth initially and then slows down and improves further. In this way, it shows different stage characteristics from the tourism poverty alleviation level. (2) The discordant coupling between tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments in Liupanshui city shows a decreasing curve. So, the noncoordinated development relationship between tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments is significant.

AB In 2020, China will fully realize a well-off society. To achieve this goal, China's poverty alleviation work has entered a crucial stage. Under the background of the Internet era, the "Internet + Order Agriculture + Precision Poverty Alleviation" model has been formed, and the order agriculture has played an important role in promoting the development of precision poverty alleviation. Based on 1000 questionnaires in Hubei Province, this paper quantitatively studied the impact of contract farming on farmers' income levels using multiple linear regression methods. The research shows that there is a positive correlation between farmers' participation in contract farming and farmers' income, and the correlation coefficient is high, indicating that farmers' participation in contract farming can significantly increase their income. Therefore, the promotion of contract farming is conducive to the in-depth development of regional precision poverty alleviation, and can help farmers solve poverty problems.

TI Does microfinance reduce poverty? New evidence from Northeastern
   Mindanao, the Philippines
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB This article focuses on understanding the impact of microfinance on poverty reduction and wellbeing measures of health, education and living standards in Northeastern Mindanao, the Philippines. We employ a mixed method approach involving a survey of 211 microfinance client and non-client households. We find that little over one in five households are multidimensionally poor, with non-client households being poorer than microfinance client households. Our results show that microfinance has had a mildly positive impact on poverty reduction with incomes and savings of microfinance client households being higher than those of non-client households. Based on the impact of microfinance on poverty reduction, we argue that it is important that policymakers implement strategies for promoting and creating greater access to microfinance as this has the capacity to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of the poor and marginalised in the Philippines.

This chapter then offers a review of existing proposals for poverty reduction aftet 2015, followed by a proposition arguing that locally developed national poverty lines would be more effective for future poverty reduction in specific country cases. A genuine political will to make meaningful partnership among various actors would also require fights against poverty at country levels.

TI Ethnicity and Child Poverty under New Labour: A Research Review
SO SOCIAL POLICY AND SOCIETY
AB This review article explores the evidence on child poverty rates amongst different ethnic groups in the UK. The Labour Government aims to end child poverty by 2020. Its strategy rests on improving employability, making work pay and expanding childcare provision. But child poverty rates among ethnic minorities are higher than among white people, which suggests that policies to reduce these have been ineffectual. The factors underlying this differential include labour market disadvantage, insensitive mainstream services and the language barriers that may cause low take-up of services, benefits and tax credits. The article concludes by suggesting a number of policy strategies that government could take to reduce the levels of child poverty amongst ethnic minorities.

TI The code of targeted poverty alleviation in China: A geography
   perspective
SO GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Geography is suitable for the study of sustainability from a transdisciplinary perspective, which takes the humanland relationship as the core research. As a key obstacle to rural sustainability, poverty is an external manifestation of the coupling maladjustment of elements in human-land territorial systems. As the world's largest developing country, China eradicated extreme poverty in 2020 and made significant contributions to global poverty reduction. Especially over the last eight years, China has implemented a targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) strategy and has continuously promoted theoretical, organizational and institutional innovations for poverty reduction. From the perspective of geography, this paper extracts the experiences of China's TPA strategy, represented by the "5W2H" mode. The research concludes that (1) Precise identification, as the foundation of TPA, aims to introduce a registration system to obtain records of all poor households and then answer the "5W" (what, where, why, who, when) issues of the geography of poverty. (2) Precise assistance is the key of TPA, which aims to solve the issue of "how to offer help and support". The barriers to escaping poverty can be accomplished through policies and measures that focus on the diverse causes of poverty and considering different situations. (3) Accurate assessments are an essential means of TPA, relevant to solve "how to measure the end of poverty alleviation", and third-party evaluations play an important role in improving the accuracy of poverty alleviation. (4) The TPA mechanism lies in reconstructing the human-land-industry structures in the impoverished areal system. It is urgent to introduce China's successful experience and typical modes of TPA for global human-earth system coordination and sustainable development and contribute to building a community of human destiny.

TI Targeted Poverty Alleviation in China: A Typology of Official-Household
   Relations
SO PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation' (TPA) is the Chinese government's latest anti-poverty policy, aiming to lift the remaining 70 million Chinese citizens above the poverty line by 2020. The TPA scheme is novel in that every impoverished household is paired one-on-one with a local government official, who then bears responsibility for the eradication of their poverty. Despite being at the core of TPA, this pairing mechanism has received little academic attention. Based on an empirical case study of ten households across two villages in rural Shaanxi Province, China, this article aims to investigate this pairing mechanism at the micro level and its outcomes for poverty alleviation, in order to better understand how the notion of 'precision' is being realized through TPA. Two distinct traits that influence the TPA pairing system emerged: first, the ranking of the assigned local official is important in that higher-ranked officials have greater social and financial resources at their disposal, bringing about enhanced poverty alleviation outcomes for their households compared with lower-ranked officials. Secondly, the willingness and ability of impoverished households to actively participate in their poverty alleviation programme is beneficial within the TPA scheme, achieving better outcomes in the long-term compared with households who are passive receivers. TPA has the potential to work effectively and to achieve China's poverty reduction goals; however, our analysis shows that some pairing mechanisms are more effective in achieving poverty alleviation goals than others.

TI Mediating effects of parental psychological distress and
   individual-level social capital on the association between child poverty
   and maltreatment in Japan
SO CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB Child poverty is well known as a major risk factor for child maltreatment. However, it is not known whether parental psychological distress and individual-level social capital mediate the association. We examined the mediation effect of these two factors on the association between child poverty and maltreatment. In the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) Study, a questionnaire was administered to all caregivers of first-grade children in every public elementary school in Adachi City between July and November 2015, and valid responses were used for analysis (N = 3944). Logistic and Poisson regression analyses were employed to examine the association between child poverty and maltreatment. Child poverty was defined in this study as meeting one of these criteria: 1) household income less than 3 million yen; 2) deprivation of specific material items that children or the household requires, or 3) experience of being unable to pay for lifeline utilities. Child maltreatment (physical abuse, neglect, and psychological abuse) was answered by parents. We confirmed a robust association between child poverty and maltreatment. Mediation analysis indicated that parental psychological distress mediated more than 60% of the association between child poverty on physical abuse and psychological abuse, while individual-level social capital mediated only 10% of the association with any type of maltreatment. In addition, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that the association was mediated by both parental psychological distress and social capital simultaneously. The findings suggest that supporting parental psychological distress may be an effective intervention to remedy the negative impact of child poverty on maltreatment.

   Financing Constraints
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTION SPACES
AB In China, enterprises participating in targeted poverty alleviation can be provided with a strategic resource to enhance their ultimate value creation ability and directly win reputation and obtain sustainable competitive advantages, thus enhancing their innovation ability. In this study, the influence and mechanism of the participation in targeted poverty alleviation on enterprise innovation investment are empirically examined based on financing constraints with the data of nonfinancial listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2012 to 2019 as the object. The research suggests that enterprises taking the initiative to participate in targeted poverty alleviation can first have increased innovation investment and especially enhanced exploratory innovation ability. Second, enterprises' participation in targeted poverty alleviation can reduce financing constraints of enterprises' innovation, improve their resource allocation efficiency, and stimulate their innovation vitality primarily through the influence of resource, reputation, and information. This study enriches the theoretical research on the economic consequences of targeted poverty alleviation and provides a reference for guiding enterprises in practice to fulfill social responsibilities to promote enterprises' innovation vigor and boost their high-quality development.

TI Protecting Ecosystems and Alleviating Poverty with Parks and Reserves:
   'Win-Win' or Tradeoffs?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB National parks and reserves are globally popular approaches to protecting biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services. Because these protected areas limit agricultural development and exploitation of natural resources, they are frequently opposed in developing nations where reducing poverty is an important social objective. Conservation advocates argue that protected areas can alleviate poverty by supplying ecosystem services, promoting tourism and improving infrastructure. Thus 'win-win' scenarios may be possible in which ecosystems and their services are protected and poverty is alleviated. Previous studies (Andam et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105(42):16089-16094 2008; 2010) suggest that Costa Rica's protected area system reduced deforestation and alleviated poverty. We demonstrate that these environmental and social impacts were spatially heterogeneous. Importantly, the characteristics associated with the most avoided deforestation are the characteristics associated with the least poverty alleviation. In other words, the same characteristics that limited the conservation effectiveness of protected areas may have improved the social welfare impacts of these areas. These results suggest that 'win-win' efforts to protect ecosystems and alleviate poverty may be possible when policymakers are satisfied with low levels of each outcome, but tradeoffs exist when more of either outcome is desired.

We obtain a high rate of provincial income convergence and a tradeoff between equity and growth. The lack of political competition inhibits growth.

TI Child Poverty, Child Maintenance and Interactions with Social Assistance
   Benefits Among Lone Parent Families: a Comparative Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
AB In many developed countries lone parent families face high rates of child poverty. Among those lone parents who do get child maintenance there is a hidden problem. States may retain all, or a proportion, of the maintenance that is paid in order to offset other fiscal costs. Thus, the potential of child maintenance to alleviate poverty among lone parent families may not be fully realized, especially if the families are also in receipt of social assistance benefits. This paper provides an original comparative analysis exploring the effectiveness of child maintenance to reduce child poverty among lone parent families in receipt of social assistance. It addresses the question of whether effectiveness is compromised once interaction effects (such as the operation of a child maintenance disregard) are taken into account in four countries Australia, Finland, Germany and the UK using the LIS dataset (2013). It raises important policy considerations and provides evidence to show that if policy makers are serious about reducing child poverty, they must understand how hidden mechanisms within interactions between child maintenance and social security systems can work as effective cost recovery tools for the state, but have no poverty reduction impact.

This study empirically investigates the dynamic linkage between agricultural value added (AVA) and poverty reduction for a panel of nine countries in Southern Africa using a second-generation panel approach for the period 1990 to 2015. Empirical results show that agricultural development is necessary but not a sufficient policy to combat poverty as it is only viable in the short run. Thus, we suggest long-run economic programs and/or strategies that will complement agricultural development toward poverty alleviation to spur economic growth in the sampled region.

AB This chapter examines poverty among children in the Countries of South-Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States in the early 2000s.
   Three aspects of child poverty are examined - its demographic dimension, its regional dimension, and its relationship to migration. The most important findings from a policy point of view are the strong rural character of child poverty, and the relationship between child population density (at the level of the country, the sub-national region, and the household) and child poverty: where child population shares are higher, child poverty rates are also higher. Child population density needs to be seen more as a trigger to redistribution. In addition, the analysis finds that in some countries, poverty among children of single parents is reduced by their particular patterns of migration and remittance flows. However, parental migration to economically Support children raises important questions about material well-being in relation to other aspects of child wellbeing. These warrant further analysis.

Using the 1996-2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate that in mid-2011, 1.65 million households with 3.55 million children were living in extreme poverty in a given month, based on cash income, constituting 4.3 percent of all nonelderly households with children. The prevalence of extreme poverty has risen sharply since 1996, particularly among those most affected by the 1996 welfare reform. Adding SNAP benefits to household income reduces the number of extremely poor households with children by 48.0 percent in mid-2011. Adding SNAP, refundable tax credits, and housing subsidies reduces it by 62.8 percent.

TI The impact of high speed railway on government expenditure on poverty
   alleviation in China -Evidence from Chinese poverty counties
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB In this paper, we evaluate the role of the high speed railway (HSR) project, one of the largest transportation infrastructure projects in the world, in poverty alleviation in China. This study combines county-level data from the China County Statistical Yearbooks with HSR data from the China Railway Yearbooks. The method of difference-in-differences is applied to examine the HSR connection effect on government expenditure in poverty alleviation across Chinese poverty counties over the period of 2010-2018. The results show that the HSR connection has a significantly positive impact on reducing government expenditure in poverty alleviation. Our results, which are based on alternative measurement of poverty alleviation and possible bias arising from endogeneity issue, are robust. This paper highlights that HSR can help achieve accessibility of rural area and poverty alleviation simultaneously. An understanding of the effect is critical for policymakers to promote intra-regional development, balancing efficiency and regional equality.

TI Poverty alleviation, coverage and fiscal sustainability: Investigating
   the effect of a new social pension in Hong Kong
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
AB This article synthesises the characteristics of social pensions across Asia and evaluates the effect of a new social pension in the Hong Kong SAR, the Old Age Living Allowance (OALA), on poverty alleviation, coverage rates and fiscal sustainability. We found that the effectiveness of the OALA in reducing old-age poverty was limited, although it has led to an increase of retirement pension coverage by 6%. The OALA is projected to face substantial cost increases in the medium and longer term. Increasing the level of OALA benefits would be a direct means to enhance its poverty alleviation effect but may potentially be hampered by concerns about the fiscal sustainability of such changes. More obfuscated alternatives for Hong Kong policy makers to affect old-age poverty alleviation include adjusting the indexing rules of benefit level payments and the eligibility criteria to reduce the stigma attached to the current policy choices.

TI POVERTY ALLEVIATION THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES: A
   FRAMEWORK FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB The traditional macroeconomic approach to poverty alleviation in neighborhoods and communities is to use housing development and job-creation programs to address the income and the opportunity gaps. Entrepreneurship is a much less used poverty alleviation strategy that, in our estimation, can have a significant effect in favorable policy environments. After a brief literature review, we highlight policy approaches that use entrepreneurship as a poverty alleviation strategy. We present several case studies from the United States as evidence of how public policy can empower an entrepreneurial ecosystem to support the self-employed and other low-income entrepreneurs. We conclude with a framework for how public policy can alleviate poverty through entrepreneurship that is generalizable in other contexts.

TI Investigating the role of foreign capital inflows and economic freedom
   in poverty alleviation
SO ECONOMICS AND FINANCE LETTERS
AB Many developing countries are still suffering considerable poverty despite the enormous amounts of international development aid channeled to them. This phenomenon raises the question of what role foreign capital plays in these countries. Our study focused on the role of foreign capital (foreign direct investment and foreign aid) and economic freedom in poverty alleviation in developing and least-developed countries using panel data from 1995 to 2018 for 71 countries. We employed several econometric techniques, such as dynamic ordinary least squares, fully modified ordinary least squares, dynamic fixed effects, and pooled mean group regression methods. Furthermore, we performed the Granger causality test, tested the impulse response function, and conducted variance decomposition analysis. In our long-run estimations, we found that while foreign direct investment could significantly alleviate poverty, it increased poverty in the short run. On the other hand, foreign aid played no significant role in poverty alleviation in either the short or the long run. Moreover, to alleviate poverty, economic growth and economic freedom are essential; our findings consistently demonstrated that they play a crucial role in poverty alleviation. We also found bidirectional causality between poverty alleviation and population growth, while a unidirectional causal linkage was found from poverty alleviation to foreign aid. We conclude that policymakers should develop a new paradigm of developmental assistance, and governments should create an enabling environment for foreign investment to support their growth plan.

TI Monitoring Progress in Child Poverty Reduction: Methodological Insights
   and Illustration to the Case Study of Bangladesh
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Important steps have been taken at international summits to set up goals and targets to improve the wellbeing of children worldwide. Now the world also has more and better data to monitor progress. This paper presents a new approach to monitoring progress in child poverty reduction based on the Alkire and Foster adjusted headcount ratio and an array of complementary techniques. A theoretical discussion is accompanied by an assessment of child poverty reduction in Bangladesh based on four rounds of the demographic household survey (1997-2007). Emphasis is given to dimensional monotonicity and decomposability as desirable properties of multidimensional poverty measures. Complementary techniques for analysing changes over time are also illustrated, including the Shapley decomposition of changes in overall poverty, as well as a range of robustness tests and statistical significance tests. The results from Bangladesh illustrate the value added of these new tools and the information they provide for policy. The analysis reveals two paths to multidimensional poverty reduction by either decreasing the incidence of poverty or its intensity, and exposes an uneven distribution of national gains across geographical divisions. The methodology allows an integrated analysis of overall changes yet simultaneously examines progress in each region and in each dimension, retaining the positive features of dashboard approaches. The empirical evidence highlights the need to move beyond the headcount ratio towards new measures of child poverty that reflect the intensity of poverty and multiple deprivations that affect poor children at the same time.

TI Is the photovoltaic poverty alleviation project the best way for the
   poor to escape poverty?-A DEA and GRA analysis of different projects in
   rural China
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation project (PPAP) is an important innovation in China's targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) mission. Through investment in the renewable energy industry and an emphasis on poverty alleviation in rural areas, China's TPA has achieved great success. Although China has invested large amounts of money in PPAP, its actual contribution to rural poverty alleviation has not been verified. This paper analyzes the contribution of PPAP's efficiency in TPA via data envelopment analysis (DEA) and grey relation analysis (GRA). The results show that: 1) the overall efficiency of TPA is high; 2) the overall efficiency of TPA has large geographical differences; 3) the inputs of TPA have a great impact on the efficiency of poverty alleviation; and 4) China's investment in PPAP is indeed effective, but its impact on poverty alleviation is overestimated. Therefore, we propose four policy recommendations: 1) the scale and proportion of financial investment in TPA should be optimized; 2) local governments should allocate poverty alleviation funds according to local situations; 3) the Chinese central government should strengthen macro control and reduce support for PPAP; and 4) local governments should balance the allocation of funds for PPAP and other poverty alleviation projects.

But the validity of beneficiaries' subjective evaluation for objective performance has been questioned by scholars. And there are few domestic empirical studies about the item. This article addresses the gap. The study adopted the polytomous logit model to analyze weather the subjective evaluation can reflect objective performance via "beneficiaries' perception" as intermediate variable. Based on a case study of Sichuan province, the results show a significant correlation between the poverty alleviation performance and beneficiaries' subjective satisfaction. The beneficiaries of poverty alleviation project can perceive the objective performance in a sense.

TI Rural Poverty Reduction Policies in Honduras, Nicaragua and Bolivia:
   Lessons from a Comparative Analysis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB A common trait of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) in Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua is the relative lack of priority assigned to the rural sector despite the high incidence of poverty found there, as well as their inability to focus on the key determinants of rural poverty. The dynamics of the PRSP process and their impact on rural poverty are analysed. Although the factors accounting for the poor results attained by poverty reduction strategies vary between the countries discussed, a common factor is the limited capacity of the State to design and implement development strategies that are able to tackle the structural causes of poverty, and hence achieve substantial and sustainable reductions in poverty. This conclusion is reinforced by a comparative analysis with South Korea and Taiwan, which have succeeded in significantly reducing poverty through a growth with equity developmentalist strategy.

TI Chinese photovoltaic poverty alleviation: Geographic distribution,
   economic benefits and emission mitigation
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB As a part of an environmentally concerned development strategy, the photovoltaic poverty alleviation in China is adopted to lift households above the rural extreme poverty line by the end of 2020. With the detailed project level data in 534 counties, 22 provinces, this systematic assessment on Chinese photovoltaic power projects identifies geographic distribution, economic benefits and emission mitigation for deployment distribution and policy implications. Overall, the photovoltaic installed capacity has reached 5213.37 MW, with the income generation of 7.41 billion CNY per year and the carbon emission mitigation of 5.98 million tons. From the results in this work, it is obvious that the GDP and household savings per capita in most counties and cities are lower than in those without photovoltaic poverty alleviation stations. As an essential strategy of generating income and mitigating emissions especially in countries well-endowed with sunlight, the deployment of photovoltaic power projects is consistent with sustainable development goals relating to global poverty eradication. With the assessments on the photovoltaic power stations, the initial implementation of photovoltaic poverty alleviation revealed a number of problems and solutions, which are practical for systematic deployment and policy implications of relevant photovoltaic power projects worldwide.

TI The Levels and Trends in Deep and Extreme Poverty in the United States,
   1993-2016
SO DEMOGRAPHY
AB Recently, there has been tremendous interest in deep and extreme poverty in the United States. We advance beyond prior research by using higher-quality data, improving measurement, and following leading standards in international income research. We estimate deep (less than 20% of medians) and extreme (less than 10% of medians) poverty in the United States from 1993 to 2016. Using the Current Population Survey, we match the income definition of the Luxembourg Income Study and adjust for underreporting using the Urban Institute's TRIM3 model. In 2016, we estimate that 5.2 to 7.2 million Americans (1.6% to 2.2%) were deeply poor and 2.6 to 3.7 million (0.8% to 1.2%) were extremely poor. Although deep and extreme poverty fluctuated over time, including declines from 1993 to 1995 and 2007 to 2010, we find significant increases from lows in 1995 to peaks in 2016 in both deep (increases of 48% to 93%) and extreme poverty (increases of 54% to 111%). We even find significant increases with thresholds anchored at 1993 medians. With homelessness added, deep poverty would be 7% to 8% higher and extreme poverty 19% to 23% higher in 2016, which suggests that our estimates are probably lower bounds. The rise of deep/extreme poverty is concentrated among childless households. Among households with children, the expansion of SNAP benefits has led to declines in deep/extreme poverty. Ultimately, we demonstrate that estimates of deep/extreme poverty depend critically on the quality of income measurement.

TI Pediatric Primary Care and Partnerships Across Sectors to Promote Early
   Child Development
SO ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS
AB Poverty remains a critical predictor of children's school readiness, health and longer term outcomes. Early relational health (ERH) (ie, parenting practices and relationship quality) mediates the impact of poverty on child development, and thus has been the focus of many parenting interventions. Despite the documented efficacy of parenting interventions at reducing poverty-related disparities in child health and development, several key barriers prevent achieving population-level reach to families with young children. In the current paper we highlight several of these barriers including gaining population-level access to young children and families, reaching families only through single points of access, addressing the significant heterogeneity of risk that exists among families living in poverty, as well as addressing each of these barriers in combination. We suggest that understanding and confronting these barriers will allow family-centered interventions to more effectively address issues related to ERH at a population level, which in turn will reduce poverty-related disparities in child development.

SO FOOD POLICY
AB This study focuses on which agricultural subsectors are important. in Ethiopia's economic growth and poverty reduction and what kind of agricultural and nonagricultural growth is needed to achieve the millennium development goal of halving the incidence of poverty by 2015. A spatially disaggregated, economy-wide model was developed, enabling the analysis of growth and poverty reduction linkages at national and regional levels using national household surveys, agricultural sample surveys, geographic information systems, and other national and regional data. The study reveals that agriculture cart play a central role in decreasing poverty and increasing growth in Ethiopia. Within the agriculture, growth in cereals and other staple crops should receive priority. Agricultural growth also requires concurrent investments in roads and other market conditions. At the subnational level, similar growth rates within agricultural subsectors have different effects on poverty, necessitating regionally based strategies for growth and poverty reduction.

It examines the recent shift by bilateral and multilateral donors to 'pro-poor' development strategies in fragile states by considering the case of Haiti, a country with high levels of poverty and intense donor interest. The paper examines whether recent insights on poverty reduction are driving the current economic development strategy in Haiti. It does so by comparing the strategies and programs advanced during the first round of peacebuilding efforts (1994-2000), prior to donors embracing the poverty reduction imperative, with current efforts (2004-07), which are ostensibly aimed at poverty reduction.

TI Can China's Digital Inclusive Finance Alleviate Rural Poverty? An
   Empirical Analysis from the Perspective of Regional Economic Development
   and an Income Gap
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Digital inclusive finance (DIF) plays an active role in preventing poverty-stricken groups from returning to poverty and reducing poverty. This paper empirically tests the impact of DIF on rural poverty alleviation using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2020 as a sample. It employs multiple linear regression, mediation effect models, and threshold effect models. The results show that: (1) DIF and its three sub-indicators (coverage breadth, depth of use, and digitalization degree) have significant poverty reduction effects, and the findings hold even when endogeneity is taken into account; (2) a study of regional heterogeneity found that DIF and its sub-indices, coverage and depth of use in the eastern region, have the greatest effect on the poverty alleviation of rural residents, and the effects in the central and western regions have the least effect; (3) the mediation effect test found that DIF could indirectly promote poverty alleviation in rural areas by promoting regional economic growth and narrowing the urban-rural income gap. The Sobel test shows that the mediating effect of regional economic growth is greater than the mediating effect of the urban-rural income gap; (4) it is found through the threshold effect test that regional economic growth has a double threshold effect on rural poverty alleviation, and as the threshold value continues to increase, the poverty reduction effect increases in turn. Therefore, this paper puts forward policy suggestions for the aspects of accelerating the development of DIF in rural areas, implementing regionally differentiated poverty reduction strategies according to local conditions, promoting regional economic growth, and narrowing the urban-rural income gap.

   Economic Framework Limits Child Poverty Reduction in the UK
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
AB This paper assesses the policy consensus that exists amongst political parties in the UK in their shared ambition to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Three major pillars of policy work intensification, re-distribution and skill upgrading - are challenged in terms of their likely success in reducing child poverty. In particular, the assumption that upgrading skills will raise earnings is challenged by examining the changing patterns of work in a selection of developed economies since the 1970s. This paper argues that addressing relative poverty requires an alternative theoretical approach to the neoclassical economics that currently underpins policy. Different national levels of earnings dispersion suggest that the role of institutions and culture in determining market outcomes deserves at least as much attention as the supply of skills.

TI FAMILY TRANSFERS AND CHILD POVERTY IN GREECE, ITALY, SPAIN AND PORTUGAL
SO MICRO-SIMULATION IN ACTION
SE Research in Labor Economics
AB The paper examines the effect of family transfers on child poverty in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Family transfers are defined as to include non-contributory child benefits, contributory family allowances and tax credits or allowances. The drive to reduce child poverty is of particular interest in southern Europe, where public support to poor families with children is often meagre or not available at all. The paper uses the European cross-country microsimulation model, EUROMOD, to assess the distributional impact of existing family transfers and to explore the scope for policy reforms, before it concludes with a discussion of key findings and policy implications.

TI DOES ENERGY EFFICIENCY MATTER FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND ECONOMIC
   GROWTH? A FRESH EMPIRICAL INSIGHT FROM AN ASIAN PERSPECTIVE
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Globally, everybody deals with poverty as a shared societal issue. It is still unclear how to investigate its causes and create new paradigms for policy, but it offers many promising directions for academic study. The use of technological innovation in this environment for social change to address poverty reduction is also an important issue. Consequently, this study investigates how effective poverty reduction may be accomplished in Asia through technological innovation and financial development. The super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model and system generalized method of moments were utilized in the present study together with data from 2010 to 2020 for an empirical estimate. The data show that different areas have effectively reduced poverty over time. However, Asia's overall effectiveness in reducing poverty is rather unevenly distributed geographically. The significance of poverty reduction in Asia is positively impacted by technical advancement and financial prosperity. The effects of globalization on the efficacy of poverty reduction are negligible. This study presents some policy insights for decision makers based on the empirical findings.

TI Rural Poverty Alleviation Strategies and Social Capital Link: The
   Mediation Role of Women Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation
SO SAGE OPEN
AB This article presents a novel insight into the extent to which social capital, social innovation, and women entrepreneurial activities contribute to rural poverty alleviation. Applying the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique through SmartPLS software version 3.0, data from a total sample of 333 women entrepreneurs in the Agribusiness sector from the Sekyere South District in Ghana were empirically analyzed. The findings from the study highlight the transformative potential of rural women entrepreneurs who utilize social capital from both formal and informal social networks toward rural poverty alleviation. Thus, study results revealed that women entrepreneurship growth performance is positively and significantly associated with rural poverty alleviation. Furthermore, the impacts of social innovation and relational social capital on poverty alleviation showed positive. We recommend that policymakers and development practitioners should empower more women into entrepreneurial activities in the agribusiness sector in rural areas to promote rural poverty alleviation in developing countries.

TI OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCING SOCIAL POLICY IN REDUCING CHILD POVERTY: THE
   PERSPECTIVE OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS
SO LJETOPIS SOCIJALNOG RADA
AB On the basis of an analysis that revealed a gap between European Union guidelines, national strategies, and social policy programmes on the one hand and specific achievements in the combating of poverty and social exclusion of children in Croatia on the other, the aim of this paper was to deepen the understanding of circumstances contributing to or aggravating the efficiency of the social policy in the fight against child poverty and of opportunities for advancing social action in this area. The research included 13 key stakeholders who were selected deliberately in view of their expected competence concerning the topic and their experience: seven officials or high-ranking experts at the level of state bodies or local government and self-government, three key persons from prominent civil society organisations, and three independent experts. The data was collected via the method of semi-structured interview.
   The analysis showed a high level of agreement among key stakeholders concerning the lack of any substantial (political and social) interest in child poverty and concerning the inefficiency of social policy in reducing child poverty. It also emphasized the need to change the socioeconomic environment, strategic framework, current public policy practices as well as the need to ensure socially responsible action and responsibility on the part of all stakeholders for the prevention and reduction of child poverty. The findings were discussed in seven key points. The first relates to the necessity of considering poverty from the perspective of the rights of the child and the promotion of child well-being. Following a critical review of the indicators of inefficiency of social policies in the combating of child poverty, especially the absence of a multidimensional and comprehensive approach in the eradiction of child poverty, we advocate an integrated instead of a fragmented approach to child poverty. Special attention is paid to the key role of the state and the necessity to veer the discourse from the abuse of social rights towards the importance of early investments and preventive programmes. In that respect, we also advocate the preventive role of educational institutions that should assume their share of responsibility as soon as possible as well as the strengthening of the role of civil society organisations in the prevention and mitigation of child poverty. Finally, we emphasize the necessity of systematic evaluations of the existing public policies and evidence-based action at all levels. In conclusion, we emphasize the opportunity that is available to the current Government of the Republic of Croatia to transform unfavourable trends and develop an integrated approach to child poverty.

TI ALLEVIATING POVERTY IN NIGERIA: KEYNESIAN VS MONETARY THEORY OF POVERTY
SO STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS VASILE GOLDIS ARAD SERIA STIINTE ECONOMICE
AB This study comparatively investigates the impacts of fiscal and monetary policies on poverty in Nigeria from 1986 to 2018. Using the Ordinary Least Square and Standardized or Beta Coefficient approach, we found that the Nigerian political system plays a vital role on a large number of its citizens living in extreme poverty. Other factors identified as the likely causes of poverty are insurgencies, terrorism, and low productivity among others. Also, monetary policy is more important in alleviating poverty than the fiscal policy which favored the monetary school arguments. Specifically, monetary measures like exchange rate and interest rate are more significant in alleviating poverty far more than inflation rate while fiscal measures proxy with government recurrent expenditure plays a more vital role in alleviating poverty in Nigeria than others like government capital expenditure and government recurrent expenditure. The study recommended that in the case of monetary measures, there is a need for Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria, to shift their attention towards key monetary policy measures like interest rate and exchange rate compare to other monetary measures.

TI The Dynamic Impact of Agricultural Fiscal Expenditures and Gross
   Agricultural Output on Poverty Reduction: A VAR Model Analysis
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB China was the first developing country to achieve the poverty eradication target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 10 years ahead of schedule. Its past approach has been, mainly, to allocate more fiscal spending to rural areas, while strengthening accountability for poverty alleviation. However, some literature suggests that poor rural areas still lack the endogenous dynamics for sustainable growth. Using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, based on data from 1990 to 2019, we find that fiscal spending plays a much more significant role in reducing the poverty ratio than agricultural development. When poverty alleviation is treated as an administrative task, each poor village must complete the spending of top-down poverty alleviation funds within a time frame that is usually shorter than that required for successful specialty agriculture. As a result, the greater the pressure of poverty eradication and the more funds allocated, the more poverty alleviation projects become an anchor for accountability, and the more local governments' consideration of industry cycles and input-output analysis give way to formalism, homogeneity, and even complicity. We suggest using the leverage of fiscal funds to direct more resources to productive uses, thus guiding future rural revitalization in a more sustainable direction.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AFRICAN RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB The article documents the findings of a qualitative study that assessed the sustainability of providing resources for poverty alleviation. It argues that access to resources does not assure livelihood security. The study also argues that the ability to sustain resources, rather than merely facilitating access, assures poverty alleviation and livelihood security. Using a qualitative research method and the sustainable livelihoods approach, the article assesses the activities and performance of a small group of women in a government-sponsored agricultural project. The findings reveal that exited projects struggle to sustain themselves and that assetting alone - without skills, capacity, sense of ownership and a clear focus - does not yield the sustainability necessary for poverty alleviation. The conclusion is made that although resources are a necessary first step towards poverty alleviation, sustainable resource management should be highly valued in the process. The article recommends that agriculture-based development projects not be seen as the only option for the rural poor, as knowledge of farming is indeed crucial.

SO REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA
AB Domestic socio-economic development has acquired great achievement, while poverty is still a major problem in restraining the development of domestic rural areas. The past developmental poverty alleviation could not satisfy the requirement for poverty reduction to comprehensively build the well-off society. Although distinct models of poverty alleviation through tourism for impoverished villages were proposed from the aspects of the government, enterprises, and communities, most of them, from macro perspectives, stressed on the development of tourism in impoverished villages, while specific research on who to help the development of poverty alleviation through tourism in pilot villages and how to integrate resources to implement the effective support of impoverished villages was little. For this reason, critical success factors in colleges and universities participating in poverty alleviation tourism are analyzed in this study. Aiming at visitors to Nianshan Village, Fujian Province, 300 copies of questionnaire are distributed for this study. Total 214 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 71%. The research result reveals that "government department" is the most emphasized dimension in hierarchy, followed by "social enterprise", "college and university organization", and "villages with poverty alleviation through tourism" and top five most emphasized indicators, among 17 evaluation indicators, are policy support, funding support, system design, practice base, and top management support. Finally, suggestions are proposed according to the results, expecting to help the overall development of domestic poverty alleviation tourism and promote the development of both students and impoverished villages.

TI Poverty Reduction and Good Governance: Examining the Rationale of the
   Millennium Development Goals
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB Whilst the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs) looms large, the outcomes so far have been mixed. This article examines the policy logic that `good governance' leads to poverty reduction, which has been adopted by international agencies in pursuit of the MDGs. This causal relationship is examined through an empirical panel-data estimation using Worldwide Governance Indicators and the poverty headcount ratio in ninety-eight countries. The empirical evidence does not support the hypothesis that good governance leads to poverty reduction. Good governance alleviates poverty only in middle-income countries, not in least developed ones. These findings point to the necessity to devise policies that address poverty directly, rather than through indirect instruments, and highlight the urgent need to address structural inequality in developing countries.

TI Multidimensional child poverty in Zimbabwe: Extent, risk patterns and
   implications for policy, practice and research
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB Despite significant improvements in measuring multidimensional child poverty, current research has mainly focused on developing poverty headcounts for all children simultaneously. Moreover, less attention has been devoted to understand the risk patterns of the deprivations children face. All this masks how child poverty affects differently aged and situated children. To help fill such knowledge gaps, this study employs the Bristol Approach to measure the extent and risk patterns of multidimensional child poverty among children ages five years and below in Zimbabwe using data from the 2015 Demographic and Health Survey (N = 6418). Fourteen deprivation items are selected and tested for validity, reliability and additivity to determine if they are 'good' measures of child poverty. Severe deprivation estimates are then established which indicate the extent of absolute child poverty among the children. The risk patterns of these conditions are examined too. Results reveal that all fourteen selected deprivation items are 'good' (valid, reliable and additive) measures of multidimensional child poverty among children ages five years and below in Zimbabwe. About 78% of these children are defined as severely deprived in early childhood development (ECD), 46% in water, 44% in healthcare, 40% in sanitation, 30% in shelter and 13% in nutrition. However, while there are no differences in risk of deprivation in healthcare and nutrition between deprived and undeprived children, there are risk differences in sanitation, water, shelter and ECD deprivation between deprived and undeprived children. Based on these results, the study derives several implications for policy, practice and further research.

TI Targeting, Universalism and Child Poverty in Hong Kong
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Concerns about the long-term effects of child poverty on individuals and society have been increasing. Urgent action needs to be taken to combat child poverty, but what is the best strategy likely to be? The relative effectiveness of means-tested versus universal schemes for poverty alleviation strategies has long been debated. Key differences include screening costs, targeting errors, incentive gaps and issues of financial sustainability. This article explores and compares the extent to which the Hong Kong SAR Government's current means-tested Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) scheme and alternative simulated means-tested and universal schemes could alleviate child poverty and income inequality. Core data for the study was taken from cross-sectional household survey data in Hong Kong. The study found that means-tested schemes with flat rates had higher adequacy in terms of the amount of benefits reaching poor households, than those with sliding scales. Targeting schemes had relatively higher exclusion errors compared to schemes with universal benefits. Evidence was found that that universal benefit schemes with flat rates had substantially greater impacts on all child poverty and income inequality indicators compared to the current CSSA and simulated means-tested schemes with flat rate benefits. The study is timely and presents a new and important opportunity to assess the extent to which a simulated policy change from means-tested to universal benefit could more effectively combat child poverty and reduce income inequality as well as achieve financial sustainability. The article concludes that more effective policy initiatives and approaches to child poverty and income inequality could be gained by varying dimensions, including: type of programmes (means-tested versus universal basis); benefit levels; and delivery methods (flat rate versus sliding scales). The projected expenditures of 42 cash transfer benefit schemes and four selected means-tested and universal programmes with the lowest and highest average costs can form the basis for future discussion on policy options to promote social and economic improvement for all groups.

TI Does China's poverty alleviation policy improve the quality of the
   ecological environment in poverty-stricken areas?
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Poverty eradication and environmental protection as the two global goals of sustainable development. China's poverty alleviation policy attempts to achieve green development in poverty-stricken areas by eliminating poverty while also promoting environmental protection. Since the Poverty-stricken counties on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau also have the dual attributes of ecological degradation and ecological fragility, it is of great significance to study the impact of poverty alleviation policy on their environment. In this research, taking poverty alleviation policy as the entry point, based on panel data and Remote Sensing Ecological Index for poverty-stricken counties on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2011 to 2019, and using the difference-in-differences (DID) method to verify the impact of policy on environmental quality. The main findings of the study were: 1) The poverty alleviation policy has a significant improvement effect on the ecological environment quality of counties in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, and this conclusion still holds in a series of robustness tests using methods including the changing sample size method and the variable replacement method. Moreover, the policy effect has a certain time lag and its effect persists in the long term; 2) It is mainly due to the increased level of government public expenditure and the easing of government financial pressure that has contributed to the improvement of environmental quality in poverty-stricken areas; 3) Policy heterogeneity suggests that industrial poverty eradication policies are more conducive to promoting synergistic economic and environmental development in poverty-stricken areas.

The study also disaggregates the total religious adherence variable into Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, and Catholics and finds that the effects of these denominations on child poverty are mixed. The model is tested for spatial dependence bias and the test results show that without spatial correction, the OLS results may be biased and inefficient.

AB Various efforts by national governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international donors have shown limited success in reducing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, poverty is still persistent in most households especially in rural areas. The persistence of poverty on the continent can be in part attributed to the top-down approach to development adopted by various poverty alleviation programs. This paper focuses on poverty reduction programs in Burkina Faso and argues that a community-driven approach to development and poverty reduction has the potential of lifting rural populations out of poverty trap.

TI Targeted poverty alleviation and its practices in rural China: A case
   study of Fuping county, Hebei Province
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB After nearly seventy years of poverty alleviation, China has basically solved the problem of providing food and clothing to the rural poor. However, the islanding effect of the distribution of the poor and the marginal diminishing effect of the antipoverty resources, which restrict the effects of poverty-eliminating strategies, are increasingly obvious. In this context, targeted poverty alleviation is designed by the Chinese central government. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically analyse targeted poverty alleviation and explore the mechanism of its practices. In addition to reviewing the process of antipoverty in rural China, this study investigated the connotation of targeted poverty alleviation and considered the case of Fuping in Hebei Province to explore targeted antipoverty practices. Results showed that poverty alleviation in rural China could be divided into six stages, and the essence of targeted poverty alleviation lied in helping those who truly needed help and achieving genuine outcomes by accurately identifying and assisting poverty-stricken households, accurately managing objects and measures and accurately assessing antipoverty effectiveness. The practices of targeted poverty alleviation in Fuping county mainly involved industrial development, resettlement assistance, financial and educational development, together with medical security and land consolidation, all of which built an endogenous and sustainable mechanism enabling regional development. This study suggests that targeted poverty alleviation is an innovative strategy which is suitable for overcoming the islanding effect of poverty distribution and helping policymakers formulate detailed and targeted measures to eliminate poverty.

SO JOURNAL OF HOME ECONOMICS RESEARCH
AB This paper examines the concepts of poverty, poverty reduction strategies and business education. It provides a framework for acquisition and application of business education skill for promoting self-employment and employment in both private and public sectors of the economy, for the purpose of reduction of unemployment and poverty in the country. It also goes further to examine the policy framework for poverty alleviation in Nigeria and how the acquisition and application of business education skills can promote self-employment and reduce the effects of unemployment and poverty in our society. The paper indicates that if business education programme is well applied, it will assist in employment generation and poverty reduction in Enugu State and generally in Nigeria. The paper recommends that high rate of poverty within the society can be reduced to the minimum if Nigerian learn how to create jobs rather than seeking for jobs as a way of life.

The result shows that non-farm employment play a vital role in poverty reduction in rural Vietnam. The number of household members self-employing has a significant impact on poverty reduction. Employment in domestic private enterprises also contributes significantly to poverty reduction. Finally, change in rice price only helped to reduce poverty in 2006-08 when rice price increased significantly due to the global food crisis of 2008.

AB Targeted poverty alleviation develops accurate routes for poor farmers to get rich depending on characteristics of poor households and poverty-stricken areas. Photovoltaic (PV) poverty alleviation is one of the innovative targeted poverty-alleviating modes in China, in which poor household can invest in distributed PV power plant which will be later constructed in the roofs of their houses, and the power supply company will purchase all generated power from farmers at a price of 0.98yuan ($0.14) per kwh. In this way, each poor household can earn an extra income of approximately 3,000yuan ($ 435.60). To study the actual implement of PV poverty alleviation policy, our team went to Yuexi County to carry out field research, visited a total of 5 villages, 33 households. According to the investigation, we can conclude that he five villages are representative and the participants of PV project share features of low income, low educational level and lack of working ability. Based on the current situation, the power generation is very substantial, basically in line with expectations the government estimates. However, there are still many factors, like decline in PV benchmark price, affecting the long-term profits of PV poverty alleviation. While there is also innovation emerged from implement, which will lead to stable output of power generation, but extra cost. The further improvement of the innovation and the whole PV project is worth of discussion.

A convenient sample of 236 Ugandan university students were opportunistically selected, and completed a questionnaire that assessed background characteristics, attributions for poverty, effects for poverty and its reduction, and role of organizations in the causation and reduction of poverty. Data was analysed using percentages. Causes of poverty were categorized as individualistic, fatalistic, structuralist, third world governments, international exploitation and conflict. Poverty was reported to have serious effects on people's social lives, on the families and on mental health. Ways of reducing poverty by government, development partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and organizational psychologists, and above all ways of dealing with poverty attributions, were reported.

SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB How can one assess whether social policies in one context can be effective in another? What standardized framework of inputs, outputs, results and outcomes allows one to make such global comparisons? There is resistance to creating such a standardized mechanism; in order to ensure national specificities - cultural, socio-economic and political contexts - are considered. This paper attempts to look at the responsiveness of global social policy to addressing multidimensional child poverty, through the experience of UNICEF's Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities. The Global study spans 50+ countries in Africa, Asia, CEE/CIS, Latin America and the Middle East. The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the notion of child poverty as a distinct problem and to sensitize policy makers as to how to most effectively address it. This paper looks at why UNICEF launched this effort; what concerns, considerations and principles have shaped it; and analyses the challenges of operationalizing the child poverty concepts, measures and responses across five continents. Finally, it examines what lessons the first phase of this global effort can offer to the international development community and laborers in comparative social policy.

TI Impact of livelihood capital endowment on poverty alleviation of
   households under rural land consolidation
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Poverty eradication is the primary goal of equitable and sustainable development and has received extensive attention from the international academic community. Rural land consolidation (RLC) is designed to achieve sustainable land use by combining land system reform and policy innovation; this has become an important means to promote China's poverty alleviation. From the perspective of micro-farmers, this paper takes the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) to reveal the influence of livelihood capital endowment on households' income growth and poverty alleviation under different modes of RLC. According to the survey data of registered poor households in four counties (cities) of Hubei Province and Guizhou Province, this paper uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to empirically study several combinations of initial livelihood capital endowment after the implementation of different modes of RLC. The results show that RLC improves households' initial livelihood capital endowment, reduces the vulnerability of the livelihood, thus promoting the accumu-lation of households' livelihood capital and the optimization of livelihood strategies and urging households to obtain a sustainable livelihood, so as to contribute to poverty alleviation. Whether in the government-dominated mode area or Public-Private Partnership(PPP)mode area, the five types of livelihood capital endowments of households are interdependent and collectively affect income growth and poverty alleviation. However, the requirements for households' initial livelihood capital endowments are far lower after the implementation of PPP mode RLC than those after the implementation of government-dominated RLC. Based on these findings, this paper presents corresponding policy recommendations to improve the effectiveness of RLC poverty alleviation policy, and also provides China's experience and reference for other developing countries to formulate targeted antipoverty policies.

TI Multiagent Collaborative Governance for Targeted Poverty Alleviation
   from the Perspective of Stakeholders
SO COMPLEXITY
AB As a social problem involving a wide range of objects, targeted poverty alleviation governance needs to clearly define stakeholders and identify their behaviour choices, so as to seek a multiagent collaborative governance strategy, and strive to jointly promote the realization of a targeted poverty alleviation goals in an atmosphere to win-win cooperation and benefit sharing. By constructing a three-subject evolutionary game model of local government, social organization, and poverty group in the process of targeted poverty alleviation, this paper discusses the influence of their behavioural decisions on multisubject collaborative governance of targeted poverty alleviation and selects samples to carry out simulation experiments on the model. The results show that, first, superior government support has little effect on the evolution of tripartite competition, and the conclusion is inconsistent with the general cognition. However, the enhancement of support from local governments and social organizations can effectively promote the transformation of the willingness of the poor groups to cooperate. Second, a modest increase in the punishment of social organizations and poor groups can have a binding effect on the behavioural strategy choices of both sides and ultimately promote the process of targeted poverty alleviation. Third, the increase in the benefits of social organizations and poor groups can significantly improve the willingness of both sides to cooperate, so the "endogenous driving force" of the poor groups should be enhanced to achieve the Pareto optimal state of targeted poverty alleviation.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Poverty reduction and environmental sustainability are the two significant challenges the world needs to cope with in the twenty-first century worldwide. Environmental impact is a constraint in the path of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, as well. Considering ecological footprint as a measure of environmental sustainability and accomplishing sustainable development with time-series data spanning 2010-2016, this study explores the relationship between poverty and ecological footprint. The Driscoll-Kray regression estimator is employed as it is flexible for dependencies across countries, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Findings from the studies infer that a rise in poverty reduces the ecological footprint that affects environmental sustainability. An increase in ecological footprint reduces poverty as well. The study found there is a trade-off between poverty and ecological footprint. Ambient in environmental degradation contributes significantly to reduce poverty.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB It is commonly argued that 'institutions matter' for growth and poverty reduction. While recognising the importance of institutions, it is necessary to go 'beyond institutions' in understanding the factors that promote growth and poverty reduction. This paper draws on the research findings of the IPPG Research Consortium (Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth), some of which are included in this issue, to make the following arguments. We argue, first, that the ways in which economic, political and social institutions interact are crucial in shaping pro-poor development outcomes. Secondly, the establishment of effective institutions also requires the building and strengthening of effective social, political and economic organizations, across sectors and issue areas, which can push for, negotiate, implement and monitor locally appropriate and legitimate institutional arrangements if the aim of poverty reduction is to have sustained traction as a policy goal.

TI The profile of income-poor children
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - Child poverty has become an important issue in social and political agendas. In Portugal, almost 25 per cent of children are at risk of poverty and the most vulnerable age group. This paper seeks to investigate child poverty in Portugal, using European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions microdata for 2004-2008. It explores the sociodemographic and economic attributes associated with child poverty in order to design the profile of income-poor children. Furthermore, it analyses social policies efficiency in reducing child poverty.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses descriptive methods as well as econometric tools to select the characteristics of income-poor children and to evaluate social policy efficiency. The estimation of a discrete choice model allows inference purposes.
   Findings - Results obtained show that children included in large households and in lone-parent households, are particularly at risk. Social policies undertaken had roughly impact on child poverty.
   Originality/value - This paper aims to contribute to the literature by establishing the profile of income-poor children, which may contribute to design more efficient policies to tackle the problem of child poverty. The policy evaluation sheds light on the results obtained by the current policies suggesting the discussion of new programs.

While many of these efforts have resulted in vastly improved lives for individuals and their close relations, the benefits for the community, as a whole, are less clear. This research draws on Resource-Advantage Theory to investigate the potential of community-based initiatives as a route to poverty alleviation in subsistence marketplaces. In particular, the viability of a collaborative, community-based solution is demonstrated through a case study detailing the outcome of reforestation measures in Mexico and Haiti. The findings suggest that the success of community-based initiatives in poverty alleviation efforts is predicated on combining market-oriented goals and a communal philosophy.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This research investigated the association between financial inclusion, energy poverty alleviation, and economic development in South Asian countries and found significant connections. In order to make multilateral conclusions, we have created a panel of data for nations in South Asia and estimated not only the dynamic panel estimation but also the panel unit root, Kao (1999) estimates, and the ARDL tests for each country. A significant association between financial inclusion and economic development and poverty reduction is discovered by using dynamic panel estimates. Economic development has also been shown to have a favorable influence on energy poverty alleviation. According to the findings of the ARDL analysis, financial inclusion has a beneficial influence on economic development. Financial inclusion and economic growth have reciprocal causalities in energy poverty alleviation, as shown by the study's testing of this association. As a result, it is acceptable to infer that financial inclusion favors economic development and poverty reduction in South Asia. The study also suggests the policy implications for stakeholders.

TI ADULT AND LIFELONG EDUCATION FOR POVERTY REDUCTION: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS
   OF CONTEXTS AND CONDITIONS
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB Poverty reduction is deeply implicated in structures of politics, economy, culture, and technology, from the global down to local levels. Irrespective of the particular political ideology of a nation and of the specific strategy of mobilization, adult and life-long education can and must play a significant role in reducing poverty, including preventing its inception. Yet the adult-education sector does not seem to be ready for this challenge. The present study argues that the re-education of adult educators is a dire necessity for effective poverty reduction. It also maintains that adult educators must be re-socialized in terms of their potential new roles as intellectual-activists. Only so can they work successfully towards introducing systems of adult and life-long education that are truly comprehensive and genuinely commensurate with the goals of poverty reduction.

TI Poverty eradication programs in Indonesia: Progress, challenges and
   reforms
SO JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
AB This study explores the progress of and the challenges to poverty eradication programs in Indonesia by analyzing various social assistance programs and subsidies. Earlier poverty eradication programs such as food-based assistance and energy subsidies were only designed to increase households' purchasing power. Later, the government also developed more advanced programs, such as conditional cash transfer, school assistance, and health insurance contribution assistance, to address long-run poverty by improving human capital quality. Common challenges of the existing programs remain, including inaccurate target the poor and lack of complementarity between programs. An exercise using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model shows that integrating programs into the conditional cash transfer reduces poverty further in rural and urban areas.

TI Secondary Towns and Poverty Reduction: Refocusing the Urbanization
   Agenda
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 9
SE Annual Review of Resource Economics
AB This review is framed around the exploration of a central hypothesis: A shift in public investment toward secondary towns from big cities will improve poverty reduction performance. Of course, the hypothesis raises many questions. What exactly is the dichotomy of secondary towns versus big cities? What is the evidence for the contribution of secondary towns versus cities to poverty reduction? What are the economic mechanisms for such a differential contribution, and how does policy interact with them? We find preliminary evidence and arguments in support of our hypothesis, but the impacts of policy on poverty are quite complex, even in simple settings. The question of whether a shift in investment to secondary towns reduces poverty more is an open area for research and policy analysis.

   reduction? Lessons from Zimbabwe
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
AB This paper analyses the case of Zimbabwe since independence to examine the extent to which the redistribution of land and water in developing countries results in economic growth and a reduction in poverty. In order to maximize water's contribution to poverty reduction and economic growth it is necessary to (1) distinguish between communal and commercial farmers; (2) ensure that institutions are in place to support the new communal farmers and enable them to make decisions about how best to use their new wealth; and (3) design irrigation systems with low operational costs and easy maintenance.

TI Beyond the Environmental Kuznets Curve: An Empirical Study Taking
   China's Poverty Alleviation Campaign as a Quasi-Experiment
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Poverty-stricken areas in China have the dual task of alleviating poverty and safeguarding national ecological security. Based on statistical surveys and satellite remote sensing data, we construct a staggered difference-in-difference model to empirically analyze the dual impact of poverty alleviation on the economic development and eco-environment of poverty-stricken areas. This study also examines viable pathways for economic development in poor areas in the context of ecological conservation. The results show that the poverty eradication campaign under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has significantly improved the rate of economic growth in poverty-stricken areas while also significantly improving the quality of the local eco-environment. Further analysis shows that ecological projects and ecological compensation make the greatest contribution to promoting the conversion of ecological resources into economic output in poverty-stricken areas. China's successful experience in green poverty alleviation can not only provide important policy enlightenment for the nation's continuation of its comprehensive revitalization drive in rural areas, but also provide new options for other developing countries to achieve their green take-off.

TI Trends in Child Poverty in Hong Kong Immigrant Families
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB In Hong Kong, child poverty is a serious social problem which may lead to intergenerational poverty, but nevertheless only a few studies have examined this issue, particularly for immigrant families. Using Census data (5 %) from 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011, we assessed child poverty rates in the past three decades and identified key variables contributing to changes in the risk of child poverty for both immigrant and local families. Our results indicate that child poverty rates in Hong Kong-born families have fluctuated between 14.3 and 15.8 % over the past three decades, while for immigrant families they have increased steadily and substantially from 18.1 % in 1981 to 36.5 % in 2001 and then to 37.5 % in 2011. We show that the increase in immigrant child poverty is associated with changes in the Hong Kong economy that have made it more difficult for such families to adapt to the host society, especially in the 1990s and that this negative effect offset the positive influence of compositional changes among this group of immigrant families in terms of parental education levels and family size. The gap between immigrant and local families in terms of child poverty risk is mainly due to the fact that during the 1990s the negative effect of contextual changes in Hong Kong was cancelled out by the beneficial impact of compositional changes for local families, but not for immigrant families where the latter effect was minimal.

TI The role of small-scale fisheries management in the poverty reduction
   strategies in the Western Indian Ocean region
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Combating poverty is high on the agenda of the international community and the governments of the Western Indian Ocean region. The region has very rich marine resources and the fisheries sector makes an important contribution both to national economies and to the livelihoods of the poorest sectors of society. This paper considers the linkages between fisheries management, livelihoods and poverty reduction and the way these have been incorporated in the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) approach being implemented in the region. It concludes that the sector has not always been adequately addressed in the poverty reduction strategy plans. Promotion of the importance of the sector for poverty reduction is important in order that the sector receives the appropriate recognition and budgetary support and is subject to appropriate interventions focused on alleviating poverty. Suggestions are made about how the profile of fisheries can be raised within the PRS process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Child poverty can be reduced
SO FUTURE OF CHILDREN
AB Child poverty can be reduced by policies that help families earn more and supplement earned income with other sources of cash. A comprehensive antipoverty strategy could use a combination of these approaches. This article reviews recent U.S. experience with these broad approaches to reducing child poverty and discusses lessons from abroad for U.S. policymakers. The evidence reviewed suggests that, although policies to increase earned incomes among low-wage workers can help, these earnings gains will not be sufficient to reduce child poverty substantially. Government income support programs, tax policy, and child support payments from absent parents can be used to supplement earned incomes of poor families with children. Until recently, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was the main government assistance program for low-income families with children. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) has recently replaced AFDC. This article explains why TANF benefits are likely to be less than AFDC benefits. The article also examines the effects of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income on child poverty. The most encouraging recent development in antipoverty policy has been the decline in the federal tax burden on poor families, primarily as a result of the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), now the largest cash assistance program for families with children. In 1995, government transfer programs (including the value of cash, food, housing, medical care, and taxes) decreased child poverty by 38% (from 24.2% to 14.2% of children under 18). Child poverty may also be reduced by policies that increase contributions from absent single parents to support their children. Overall, evidence from the United States and other developed countries suggests that a variety of approaches to reducing child poverty are feasible. Implementation of effective programs will depend, however, on the nation's political willingness to devote more resources to this end.

TI Effect of fiscal decentralization and dual environmental regulation on
   green poverty reduction: The case of China
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Given the increasing global emphasis on sustainable development, green poverty reduction, which integrates green development and poverty eradication, has become an important foundation and an inevitable choice for future resource conservation and long-term development. This study thus calculates the green poverty reduction index based on panel data of Chinese prefecture-level cities and constructs a panel fixed-effects model and a spatial Durbin model to empirically test the effects of fiscal decentralization and dual environmental regulations on green poverty reduction. We found that fiscal decentralization significantly inhibits green poverty reduction. Further, formal environmental regulation has a significant positive moderating effect on the above relationship, while informal environmental regulation has a weak negative moderating effect. Heterogeneity analysis showed that formal environmental regulation can significantly contribute to the green poverty reduction effectiveness of fiscal decentralization in the east-central region and in non-contiguous poverty-stricken areas, while informal environmental regulation can strengthen the disincentive effectiveness of fiscal decentralization in non-contiguous poverty-stricken areas. The results provide empirical evidence and policy insights on how to effectively optimize the fiscal decentralization structure and adjust the strength of environmental regulations to promote green poverty reduction efforts.

TI Quality of Governance, Corruption and Absolute Child Poverty in India
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT
AB Mundle, Chakraborty, Chowdhury and Sikdar (2012) developed the first quality of governance (QoG) measures to assess the performance of India's states. The present article builds on Mundle et al.'s (2012) framework by analyzing the relationship between their QoG measures and absolute child poverty in India. The empirical analysis also includes corruption indicators from Transparency International to test the relative importance of corruption and governance for combating child poverty. I combine macro (states) and micro data (children) with multilevel statistical models to achieve this task. A key finding is that governance has more explanatory power than corruption. Further, among Mundleetal.'s six measures, the BORDA measure performs consistently better and explains about 60 per cent of the between-states variation: one unit improvement in BORDA yields about 1 per cent decrease in absolute child poverty. The sensitivity of this inference is tested with regards to severe education, shelter and food deprivation.

AB Ecological migration is an important measure to promote the stability and harmonious development of society and targeted measures of poverty alleviation provides strong support for ecological migration and social stability. Therefore, this paper briefly analyzes the necessity of ecological migration to economy and ecological environment from the perspective of social integration. At the same time, ecological migration may deteriorate the financial situation of poor families, so it is necessary to carry out targeted poverty alleviation project. However, targeted poverty alleviation project still has a lot of problems, resulting in big conflicts in ecological immigrant project. In order to solve conflicts, this paper puts forward a new targeted measure of poverty alleviation and specific implementation recommendations, to provide ideas for the harmony and stability of society as well as the smooth development of ecological migration project.

AB Approximately 1.2 billion people in the world live in extreme poverty. In that light, the first United Nations - Millennium Development Goal (UN-MDG) targeted eradicating extreme poverty and halving hunger by the year 2015. In support of the UN efforts, Tanzania set itself a goal to halve extreme poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2025. Poverty is principally a rural phenomenon and agriculture is the main economic activity for the rural population, therefore the reduction of hunger and poverty significantly depend on agricultural development. The expertise and knowledge to improve agricultural productivity and to reduce poverty are there. However, Tanzania's farmers are not only deprived from accessing global knowledge on agriculture, but they also lack opportunities to share their own indigenous knowledge. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) provide a possibility for rural farmers to share and preserve their own knowledge and use external information and knowledge. This paper addresses the extent to which ICTs can appropriately be used to manage agricultural indigenous knowledge to reduce extreme poverty and hunger in the rural areas of Tanzania. It also discusses ways that ICTs can be used to disseminate exogenous knowledge in the local communities in order to attain the first UN-MDG of reducing extreme poverty and halving hunger by the year 2015. Recommendations are given on how IK can be effectively managed using ICTs by citing examples from Tanzania.

TI DECOMPOSING CHILD POVERTY REDUCTION
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SECURITY
AB European countries vary in the extent to which they succeed in reducing poverty using social transfers. However, we do not have good ways of understanding how these different outcomes are achieved. It is therefore very difficult to learn lessons from abroad. This paper uses micro data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Condition (SILC), and attempts to decompose reductions in child poverty rates and gaps into the contribution made by children, old age, social exclusion, housing and work-related benefits. The analysis is undertaken for all families with children under 16, lone parent families, couple families, and then for families with varying levels of work intensity.
   Transfers make a substantial contribution to reducing child poverty rates and closing poverty gaps. The contribution varies between countries in the European Union. There is no single model, no most successful exemplar. Some countries do better for their children in lone parent households and others do better for their children in couple households.
   The analysis has enabled some opening up of the how question, though what is going on is still something of a mystery in some countries. It is probable that analysis at the national level with greater knowledge of national benefits systems is necessary to further open the 'black box'.

AB In recent years, significant achievements have been made to alleviate poverty in China. However, many challenges still remain, especially in ethnic minority areas, where distressing circumstances remain and many contradictions persist which restrict development. In order to improve the efficiency of the measurement of anti-poverty measures and eradicate poverty, this paper was based on the multidimensional poverty measurement (Alkire and Foster). Combined with the characteristics of Guanghe county, suitable dimensions and indexes were chose to build a multidimensional model. The results show that the generally undeveloped situation of Chinese ethnic areas is caused mainly by low levels of education, poor housing condition, fewer capital assets, and narrow social relations. Therefore, to alleviate poverty, our strategy must enhance farmers per capita, net income, increase capital accumulation, improve the living environment and other measures to accelerate the process of poverty alleviation and development of the poverty-stricken ethnic minority areas and to build a well-off society in an all-round way in 2020.

TI Does agro-ecological efficiency contribute to poverty alleviation? An
   empirical study based on panel data regression
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Worldwide degradation of the ecological environment could be the cause of poverty. The poverty-stricken areas may face the dilemma of a "vicious circle of poverty." The complex ecological conditions have intertwined with poverty alleviation, which makes the demand for ecological poverty alleviation particularly prominent in these areas. However, the research on the relationship between agro-ecological efficiency and poverty are limited. It is far from clear what is the impact of the agro-ecological efficiency on poverty. To explore the impact of agro-ecological efficiency on poverty reduction, we adopt the panel data model based on cross-correlation and regression coefficient, using the data from 25 counties/districts in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) from 2006 to 2017. The results show that (1) there is significant heterogeneity in agro-ecological efficiency in the TGRR, and the agro-ecological efficiency in the middle area is significantly lower than that of the head and tail areas of the TGRR; (2) the improvement of regional agro-ecological efficiency could accelerate the alleviation of poverty; and (3) the widening of urban-rural income disparity is not conducive to poverty alleviation and eradication. This study would provide basis for further policy recommendations aimed at improving agro-ecological efficiency and alleviating poverty.

TI The political ecology of poverty alleviation in Zimbabwe's Communal
   Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE)
SO GEOFORUM
AB The CAMPFIRE program in Zimbabwe is one of a 'new breed' of strategies designed to tackle environmental management at the grassroots level. CAMPFIRE aims to help rural communities to manage their resources, especially wildlife, for their own local development. The program's central objective is to alleviate rural poverty by giving rural communities autonomy over resource management and to demonstrate to them that wildlife is not necessarily a hindrance to arable agriculture, "but a resource that could be managed and 'cultivated' to provide income and food". In this paper, we assess two important elements of CAMPFIRE: poverty alleviation and local empowerment and comment on the program's performance in achieving these highly interconnected objectives. We analyze the program's achievements in poverty alleviation by exploring tenurial patterns, resource ownership and the allocation of proceeds from resource exploitation; and its progress in local empowerment by examining its administrative and decision making structures. We conclude that the program cannot effectively achieve the goal of poverty alleviation without first addressing the administrative and legal structures that underlie the country's political ecology.

   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses pooled time-series and cross sectional data from 49 developing countries.
   Findings - The paper finds that foreign aid is effective in reducing poverty. This contradicts previous literature.
   Originality/value - The paper introduces foreign aid as another determinant of poverty in a regression model and suggests that growth-promoting and policies intended to reduce inequality are also effective in reducing poverty.

TI Child poverty in the German social investment state
SO ZEITSCHRIFTE FUR FAMILIENFORSCHUNG-JOURNAL OF FAMILY RESEARCH
AB In the last years child poverty in Germany has become a political issue. However, child poverty rates are relatively high and even on the rise. Against this backdrop we will analyse the strategy of the federal government to fight child poverty in Germany. We will demonstrate that the federal government uses a 'child-centred social investment strategy' (cf. Esping-Andersen 2002) as a blueprint. By analysing measures and instruments of the German anti-poverty Strategy, we will make clear that this strategy is not completely put into effect. Whereas Esping-Andersen propagates a fine balance of social services and financial transfers, the German government underestimates the relevance of material redistribution and focuses predominantly on social services and education. This is not by chance but can be understood as a consequence of the conceptual limits of the social investment ideology. To guarantee generational justice and to make sure that children will receive a fair share of societal resources in a rich country we plea for a children's rights-based approach to fight child poverty.

TI Size matters: targeting efficiency and poverty reduction effects of
   means-tested and universal child benefits in Russia
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
AB This article evaluates a policy change from universal to means-tested child allowances in terms of targeting efficiency and poverty reduction, taking the introduction of the latter form of benefits in Russia as a case-study. We use the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 2000 to 2004 to analyse the impact of the reforms and to simulate the effects of various means-tested and universal child benefit schemes. Since the reforms in 2000, more children have received benefits and there has been improved targeting of low income households. Nevertheless, both inclusion and exclusion errors are considerable and although the poverty reduction impact has improved marginally since the reforms, its effect on child poverty has been small. Our simulations show that universal schemes achieve additional poverty reductions with regard to all indicators because previously excluded children now also receive a benefit. However, size matters most: only by increasing benefit levels considerably can more substantial poverty reductions be achieved.

TI Investing in subsidized childcare to reduce poverty
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
AB Expanding childcare is often considered as a suitable way to enhance employment opportunities for mothers with young children as well as to reduce child poverty. In this study, the authors critically investigate this assertion by simulating a set of scenarios of increasing subsidized childcare slots and mothers' employment. For a variety of European welfare states, the impact on poverty and on the government's budget is estimated using the European microsimulation model EUROMOD. The findings suggest that to achieve significant poverty reductions among young children, both additional childcare slots and increased mothers' employment should be well targeted. The expenditures for additional childcare slots can to a large extent be recovered by the government receipts generated by the additional employment; however, there appears to be a trade-off between the extra revenue that can be generated and the extent of poverty reduction.

TI Child Support Enforcement and Child Poverty: A Long-Term Perspective
   Based on Findings from the United States
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB This article seeks to broaden the discussion of the efficacy of the Child Support Enforcement program in the United Kingdom. Many are skeptical of the program, claiming that the UK's system is meant only to recuperate public expenditures on low-income children in lieu of combating child poverty. We argue that, in addition to any assessment of the program's ability to reduce child poverty directly, any childcentric evaluation must also consider the counterfactual: How many poor people would there have been in the absence of the program? Research findings from the United States Child Support Enforcement program, a program that is similar to that found in the UK, suggest that conclusions from evaluations that incorporate the counterfactual may be different from those that critics of the UK Child Support Enforcement program reach.

TI Impoverishment Effect of Hydatid Disease and Precision Medical
   Assistance Pattern of Government: Evidence from Yushu in China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Hydatid disease is one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases recognized by WHO and causes a huge global disease burden. Hydatid disease poses a great threat to local medical poverty alleviation. In efforts to break the vicious circle of poverty, Hydatid disease has been widely concerned and discussed. In the practice of poverty alleviation in China, medical poverty alleviation is regarded as the double goal of getting rid of poverty and promoting the construction of a healthy China. On the basis of on-the-spot investigation in Yushu Prefecture, this paper conducts a follow up study on the poverty-causing effect of Hydatid disease and the precision medical assistance pattern of government using a field investigation method. The results show that Hydatid disease led to the increase of poverty in the population in Yushu Prefecture, precision medical assistance played an obvious role in treating Hydatid disease and poverty alleviation, the health service in the study area continues to improve and the medical backbone team further expanded. The main conclusion is that the three-level diagnosis and treatment framework can effectively reduce local poverty and improve people's living environment.

TI Governance or Poverty Reduction? Assessing Budget Support in Nicaragua
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB General Budget Support (GBS) is assumed to lead to more effective poverty reduction through non-earmarking of the money and through recipient country ownership. A second and more hidden objective of GBS, however, is to influence policies and governance of recipient countries. This article develops an evaluation framework that takes the tensions between these two objectives into account. It then assesses the results of GBS in Nicaragua under two administrations. It concludes that for most donors, the aim of improving governance was more important than poverty reduction, in both government periods, thus reducing the effect of GBS on poverty reduction. In addition, donor influence on governance was limited.

TI Poverty Reduction Effect of Adaptation to Climate Change: Empirical
   Evidence from China's Loess Plateau and Qinba Mountains
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Based on the micro-survey data of rural households in China's Loess Plateau and Qinba Mountains, this paper empirically examines the poverty reduction effect and mechanism of adaptation to climate change. The research conclusions show that the adaptation actions can significantly reduce the poverty vulnerability of farmers, especially the future incidence of poverty in agricultural or poor households to a greater extent, which is characterized by a "pro-poor" effect. Adaptation actions can reduce poverty from two aspects: decreasing the expected income volatility (loss mitigation effect) and increasing the expected income level (opportunity effect), and the former is stronger than the latter. In the post-2020 period, China should enhance policy support in rural areas to adapt to climate change, improve the resilience of farmers' livelihoods and climate change resilience of rural areas, and promote sustainable poverty reduction.

TI How eco-compensation contribute to poverty reduction: A perspective from
   different income group of rural households in Guizhou, China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In recent years, eco-compensation in China, or more internationally termed as the payments for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as an important policy instrument for not only environment management, but also poverty reduction. In the individual eco-compensation programs, there are usually some additional objectives other than ecosystem protection, among which poverty alleviation is the most important. In the policies on poverty alleviation, the central government of China lists eco-compensation as one of the five major approaches to alleviate poverty. However, there is little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of eco-compensation programs on poverty alleviation. This paper uses the field survey data of rural households in three poverty-stricken counties in Guizhou Province, China to evaluate the poverty alleviation effect of different eco-compensation programs on different income group of rural households. Research indicates that: for the eco-compensation programs with direct cash payment, the Sloping Land Conversion Program has a significantly positive impact on high-to-medium income group. The project of Ecological Forest Compensation Program has no significant impact on all income groups. The Ecological Job Offer Program has a great positive impact on the income of low-income households. Our research highlights that i) different eco-compensation programs might have different impacts on the same income group of households; ii) a specific eco-compensation might have different income impacts on different income groups of households; and iii) eco-compensation does not necessarily contribute to poverty reduction unless the eco-compensation scheme is purposely designed for it.

CT Conference on Child Well-Being in Rich and Transiition Countries Are
   Children in Growing Danger of Social Exclusion
CY SEP 30-OCT 02, 1999
CL LUXEMBOURG
AB Governments of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland implemented reforms of family benefits in the mid-1990s. What were the common features of those reforms and what were the possible effects on child poverty? Based on household micro data, trends in poverty among children, large families and single parents are presented for two data points. one before and one after the restrictive reforms in family policies. The focus of the analysis is on changes in the effectiveness of benefits on child poverty reduction. Child poverty increased during the observed period in all three countries, despite the efforts of governments to smooth the harmful effects of the economic downturn. Large differences in poverty levels and patterns between the three countries persisted. A relative worsening of the income position of children was accompanied by an increased level of targeting, reflected in general attempts to exclude higher-income groups from the benefit regimes. The results in the paper suggest that social transfers in general, and family benefits in particular, contributed to reduce significantly child poverty in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. However, reduction rates decreased between the early and the later 1990s. Current and future reform considerations should therefore include the objective, to reverse this trend.

TI Mining and poverty reduction: Transforming rhetoric into reality
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This article critically evaluates the contribution that mining has made to poverty reduction, and assesses the prospects for better performance in the future. The article starts from the two assumptions that mineral resources are a potentially great source of wealth for poor countries, and that the various ill-effects associated with the "resource curse" are not inevitable. It then directs its attention toward the World Bank, a leading advocate of mining-led development and an institution with a core mandate to reduce poverty. Employing the World Bank's own conceptualization of poverty as an analytical framework, the article demonstrates that mining has a dismal empirical track record to date in poverty reduction. While the theoretical reasons to believe that mining can contribute to poverty alleviation are perhaps sound, the reality of mineral-led development has not lived up to its rhetorical promise. The article elucidates problems with existing approaches and evaluates the World Bank's recently concluded Extractive Industries Review as a dramatic new paradigm shift in thinking on mining and poverty reduction. It concludes that mining can positively contribute toward poverty alleviation, but only if a variety of demanding preconditions are met. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Can mountain route tourism work for the poor? Exploring worldviews from
   Maluti Route in the Drakensberg Region of South Africa
SO TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB Poverty reduction is necessary for the attainment of sustainable tourism development. Ironically, in many mountain regions, tourism destinations are concomitant with extreme poverty. Route tourism is regarded as one of the few poverty reduction options available to mountain communities. This study used the worldviews theory to compare the perceptions of the three distinct groups, namely local communities, tourism business operators and local government officials, regarding the contribution of route tourism to poverty reduction along the Maluti Route, in the Drakensberg Mountain Region of South Africa. A survey was carried out among 80 tourism business operators and 250 community members, and complimented with in-depth interviews held with local government officials and observations that were made in tourism business organisations. The results indicate diametrically opposed viewpoints between tourism business operators and local communities. While business organisations believe that they are significantly contributing to poverty reduction in the region, local communities acknowledge only a limited number of benefits from tourism. The study concludes that tourism can work for the poor if they are adequately equipped with skills to contribute in tourism investment and if the tourism cake is deliberately 'tilted' towards them. We conclude by highlighting the need for communication among stakeholders about current efforts and options available to reduce poverty through tourism, including the training of locals in tourism related skills, as well as improving linkages among industry, government and tourism industry as a measure for enhancing the role of tourism in poverty reduction.

TI The Global Financial Crisis and Child Poverty: The Case of Australia
   2006-10
SO SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
AB While events associated with the global financial crisis (GFC) had a profound impact on real family incomes and well-being in many rich countries, impacts in Australia were relatively minor. One reason for this was the massive policy response by the Australian government at the outset of the GFC, which pumped billions of dollars into the pockets of low and middle income families. This article examines the impact of this stimulus on child poverty in Australia in the context of longer-term policies on income support for families with children. We show that the emphasis of longer-term policy has been to moderate support for families with children and that, since the mid-1990s, rates of relative child poverty have not fallen. We find that while the impact of the stimulus was to reduce child poverty, the underlying trajectory of policies towards family assistance and child poverty in Australia has not changed, and therefore there is no expectation that child poverty will continue to fall in the future.

TI The impact of poverty alleviation policies on rural economic resilience
   in impoverished areas: A case study of Lankao County, China
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB It has been recognized that China's targeted poverty alleviation policy can greatly improve the economic development of rural areas, but whether it can improve rural resilience for sustainable development has been less studied. Based on anatomising the connotation of rural economic resilience and proposing theoretical framework for the influence of policies, this study empirically analyses the implication of poverty alleviation policies on rural economic resilience using regression analysis techniques, based on field survey data from 338 villages in Lankao County, China. It is shown that rural economic resilience is connected with their resistance, adaptation, and transformation capabilities, and China's targeted poverty alleviation policies have significantly improved the economic resilience of villages because of the government's efforts to upgrade production factors, optimise the economic structure and expand rural functions have awakened the impetus of endogenous development in rural areas. Compared with resistance and transformability, poverty alleviation policies have a greater positive impact on the adaptability of rural economies. The explanatory power of poverty alleviation policies on the rural economic resilience of Lankao County shows obvious spatial differentiation. The effectiveness of poverty alleviation policies was more prominent in the southeast, where poverty was worse. The recommendations proposed based on these results can provide an important reference for promoting rural economic resilience and sustainable development in developing countries.

TI Causal relationship between FDI and poverty reduction in South Africa
SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB This study investigates the causal relationship between poverty reduction and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in South Africa using time-series data from 1980 to 2014. The main objective of this study is to establish the direction of causality between FDI and poverty reduction, which is important to policy-makers as it identifies which variable to target first. Gross domestic product is included as an intermittent variable giving a trivariate framework. Employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration and ECM-based causality tests, the results from this study reveal a distinct unidirectional causality from poverty reduction to FDI in both the short run and the long run when poverty reduction is measured by life expectancy and infant mortality rate. However, the study failed to find any causality, irrespective of the time considered, when poverty reduction is measured by household consumption expenditure. It can be concluded therefore, that the causal relationship between FDI and poverty reduction is sensitive to the proxy used to measure the level of poverty reduction.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS
AB The analysis and justification of inequality and extreme poverty and the need to eradicate or at least overcome them impose historical, ideological, and institutional reasons. Particularly concerning institutions and the new transformations of constitutionalism, this article aims to analyze the transformative role of constitutional courts as a key and effective strategy for reducing inequalities, but mainly for the eradication of extreme poverty. Based on a hypothetical and deductive methodology combined with a technique of indirect documentation analysis, it is concluded that the transformative role of constitutional courts as a key and effective strategy to confront contemporary crises in society, at least in the analysis of deliberative instruments such as public hearings to combat the eradication of extreme poverty, presents apparent effectiveness. The transformative role must recognize limits to the judicial function, especially when judicial decisions involving social rights are projected. Methodological and instrumental outlets of other sciences, together with greater recognition of judicial humility, seem to be a step to begin or, better, to resume the intended path.

TI What matters for the overall reduction of multidimensional poverty?
   Evidence from rural China
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper provides a monitoring on the reduction of multidimensional poverty in rural China from 2010 to 2016. The results indicate that significant overall alleviation is observed in the rural China. After decomposing poverty reduction through Shapley method, dimensional and regional breakdown, this paper captures the factors contributing to the overall alleviation of multidimensional poverty in rural China: the decrease of poverty incidence, rather than the reduction of poverty intensity; the improvement in the dimensions of education and living standards; and the obvious alleviation of poverty in Western China.

TI Mining development, income growth and poverty alleviation: A multiplier
   decomposition technique applied to China
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Mining has grown rapidly and is expected to continue to develop solidly in the future with the economic development in China. Based on this trend, how an increase in the outputs of mining sectors affects household income and poverty alleviation is an issue worthy of study. A multiplier decomposition method within a social accounting matrix (SAM) framework shows the linkages through which a mining sector's output contributes to household income growth and poverty alleviation. The decomposition applied to China reveals that mining development has more significantly positive impacts on the high and middle income household than low income household. Moreover, the decomposition incorporated with the Foster, Greer and Thoerbecke (FGT) poverty measure shows that the 'coal' sector contributes most to poverty alleviation and the low income household group, which has the biggest poverty rate, is the smallest beneficiary from the mining development. Thus, the policy implication is proposed that the government should give appropriate adjustment on the distribution of income between rich and poor households and help the unskilled human capital from the household group at a low income level to handle advanced technology of mining through education and training to reduce poverty more effectively.

TI Economic Growth and Extreme Poverty in Sub-Saharan African Countries:
   Non-Linearity and Governance Threshold Effect
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB Over the last few decades, many economies in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced much faster economic growth than other parts of the world. However, many of these economies have not experienced significant poverty reduction. Several factors such as the quality of governance may limit the expected effects of economic growth on poverty. This paper examines the triangular relationship between extreme poverty, governance quality, and economic growth for the sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2010-2019. Compared to the work carried out until now, the novelty of this research lies in using the Panel Threshold Regression (PTR) and Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) models to determine the optimal level of governance index, which once attained, will make extreme poverty decrease with economic growth and governance quality. We found that the nexus between these three variables is nonlinear. Besides, results show that there exists a statistically negative relationship between governance and extreme poverty above the threshold level of 0.314 for the Global Governance Index (GGI) and 66.9 for the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), above which governance quality decreases extreme poverty. The results showed that the economic growth would begin to reduce extreme poverty once governance reaches a threshold level of 0.367 for GGI and 63.2 for IIAG. Better performance of governance also appears to improve economic growth and reduces poverty.

TI Trade-off decisions in ecosystem management for poverty alleviation
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The academic literature on trade-offs in ecosystem management has paid relatively little attention to justice and poverty reduction objectives. The aim of this paper is to highlight the multiple dimensions of trade-offs in ecosystem services management for poverty alleviation, and to support decision-makers in planning for the almost inevitable trade-offs arising from environmental interventions. The paper brings together different dimensions or lenses through which to analyse trade-offs in ecosystem management for poverty alleviation in a low-income country context. Following a literature review of trade-off decisions, the paper introduces the Balance Sheets Approach to structure trade-off analysis and appraise decisions. We apply the Balance Sheets Approach to analyse five case studies set in very different social-ecological systems where trade-offs were pertinent and undermined poverty alleviation. We show how the combination of 'positive' approaches, often used at strategic level, with 'value' approaches which analyse multiple values, multi-scale governance, power and capacity, is necessary to analyse complex trade-offs. Based on the case studies we identify four lessons for future trade-off analysis in the context of ecosystem management for poverty alleviation in low-income settings.

TI Poverty alleviation approaches of development NGOs in Ghana: Application
   of the basic needs approach
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This paper discusses the applicability of the basic needs approach as a poverty alleviation analysis method in emerging development cooperation. International development organizations at the micro levels in northern Ghana have used various tools and methods in implementing their projects. The possibility to use the basic needs approach to development, which prioritizes the fulfilment of people's everyday needs as a tracker to the narrative of successes or failures of such interventions was the main objective of this study. A qualitative case study was used to research poverty reduction work of an Estonian NGO, MTU Mondo in Nabdam District of Ghana. Results showed that poverty and its alleviation mean differently to different people, hence programs aimed at reducing poverty should be analyzed using a diverse but lower level basic criteria which could be appreciated within specific communities. This paper concludes that "cooperative" basic needs approach to sustainable poverty alleviation works better in communities with acute incidence of poverty. Cooperatives formed as an implementation mechanism for economic empowerment projects serve broader purposes such as providing social capital for acutely disadvantaged communities. The paper recommends that already existing and new entrant NGOs, as well as government interventions, need to conclusively evaluate the needs of each community in which they operate, in order to customize appropriate poverty alleviation tools and projects.

SO REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA
AB Poverty rooted in the absence of capital, land resources, development rights, and human resources. Only by integrating the targeted poverty alleviation with the strategy implementation of rural revitalization, a long-term mechanism established to get rid of poverty in rural areas. At present, China is in the period of historical policy superposition, which wins the battle of poverty alleviation and implements the strategy of rural revitalization. This article deeply studies the path model and countermeasures of China's targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization. Firstly, it introduces the strategic background of targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization. Second, it presents the current research progress at home and abroad. It analyzes in detail the existing problems and cause analysis, and gives countermeasures and suggestions, such as: top-level design and overall framework, policy implementation, countermeasure suggestions, and optimization of assessment system. Guided by the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way, targeted poverty alleviation will have a more solid, higher quality and more sustainable development in the rural revitalization strategy. At the same time, rural revitalization can also gain more development momentum from the significant results achieved in the early-targeted poverty alleviation.

TI How does energy poverty eradication promote common prosperity in China?
   The role of labor productivity
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Eradicating poverty and then achieving common prosperity is a dream the Chinese people have pursued vigorously in modern times. To promote common prosperity by eradicating energy poverty, we establish a comprehensive evaluation index to analyze the level of common prosperity in China. Subsequently, we examine the energy poverty and common prosperity nexus by employing the system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) approach. Finally, we examine the mechanism and heterogeneity of energy poverty eradication affecting common prosperity. Our results show that eradicating energy poverty has a significant positive effect on common prosperity in China, and indirectly affects common prosperity by increasing labor productivity. The impact is more pronounced in China's central and eastern regions, whereas it is less significant in the western regions. Furthermore, the impact of eradicating energy poverty on common prosperity is stronger in low energy-poverty areas (LOW-EP). According to these findings, this study proposes policies to promote common prosperity by eradicating energy poverty.

TI Preventing Child Poverty: Barriers and Solutions
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB Although child poverty rates in New Zealand are about average when compared with other developed nations, they are still unacceptably high given the negative outcomes they create. Childhood poverty is associated with a range of negative health, social and psychological outcomes, all of which can place a considerable burden on the individuals, their families and their communities. The negative impacts are arguably largest when poverty coincides with a child's early years. There are therefore strong humanitarian, social and economic grounds for policy that makes eradication of child poverty a priority, as well as increased investment in children's early years. Differences in child poverty rates between developed nations are determined largely by government policy. However public attitudes towards the poor, particularly beneficiaries, can be a barrier to changing government policy. Research and practice psychologists therefore have an important role to play in influencing public attitudes towards poverty and shaping policy through active engagement in the policy-making process.

TI Climbing the poverty ladder: the role of entrepreneurship and gender in
   alleviating poverty in transition economies
SO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Poverty reduction remains a critical issue for a vast proportion of the population globally. Substantial body of literature on poverty reduction has focused on the role played by government support and charity institutions, whereas entrepreneurship as a channel for poverty reduction, and the role of gender in shaping this relationship have been under-researched, especially in the context of transition economies. Using the recent wave of the EBRD Life in Transition Survey III (2016) data, this study explores the relationship between poverty alleviation, entrepreneurship and gender. We extend the understanding of the mechanism via which entrepreneurial process is likely to contribute to poverty reduction in this region, distinguishing between self-employment and business ownership, with the latter regarded as Schumpeterian entrepreneurship. The study provides some interesting findings shedding light on the important role women play in shaping the entrepreneurship-poverty relationship.

TI The impact of microfinance on poverty and income inequality in
   developing countries
SO ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB Economic growth in developing countries provides an opportunity to accelerate progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, in reality, the number of people living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high. Utilising the experiences of 34 developing countries for the period 2009 to 2016, the role of microfinance on poverty in these countries is examined. The results imply that the degree to which the existing forms of microfinance effectively reduce extreme poverty is less workable in developing countries, particularly when the hardcore poor are likely being deprived of receiving access to microfinance. It is suggested that governments may need to revise the structure and strategy of microfinance to be more hardcore poor oriented. The hardcore poor have needs beyond pure monetary assistance. More hand-holding types of assistance are needed as most are also poor in respect of literacy, assets, and skills.

AB The welfare reform debate centers on whether the best strategy to reduce poverty is to raise work participation among low-income women or to promote marriage. Using the 1992-2001 demographic supplements of the Current Population Survey, we track child poverty rates before and after passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. We find that increasing maternal employment accounted for roughly one-half of the decline in poverty among children living with single mothers. The largest economic benefits from increasing maternal employment were observed among African American children and those living with poorly educated mothers. Unlike the 1991-1995 period, changes in family structure over 1996-2000 were no longer giving demographic impetus to higher child poverty rates. Evidence that recent declines in nonmarital fertility have reduced child poverty rates, however, is limited. We conclude with benchmark estimates of the economic implications of marriage promotion initiatives and document post-1996 increases in children's co-residence in cohabiting couple families.

However, to date, knowledge about theories, roles and the practical contribution of tourism arrangements, policy and plans in relation to poverty alleviation and nature conservation still appears to be under a process of experimentation. Research studies are scattered and there is a clear need to systematize the knowledge produced. This paper aims to address this need by analyzing a number of papers, discussing tourism, poverty alleviation and nature conservation issues, that were published in 17 scientific journals related to social science during the period 2003-2006. It classifies past research developments and research knowledge produced and identifies research gaps and opportunities by taking into account societal needs.

TI Rethinking Poverty: Class and Ethical Dimensions of Poverty Eradication
SO RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB Marxism and poverty have always lived a contradictory existence, especially in the global South. While socialism/communism's ethical imperative aspires to create a nonexploitative society, poverty eradication has been concerned with overcoming the material threat to people's livelihoods. An exploitation-free world does not necessarily mean the eradication of poverty, while the eradication of poverty does not automatically entail the erasure of exploitative relations. Struggles to eradicate poverty are distributional problems pertaining to the allotment of social surplus, which is also a class question since production surplus originates there. Correcting the injustice of poverty is not simply a distributional question, as most discourses on poverty tend to emphasize. Not only is it also a question of production, but it is very much a class question as well.

TI Rural land engineering and poverty alleviation: Lessons from typical
   regions in China
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB Poverty is a key issue restricting rural sustainable development; concurrently, regional land degradation impedes agricultural development and rural revitalization. China faces severe land degradation and deepening rural poverty under the context of rapid urbanization. To address these challenges, sustainable land use is an important tool in our society's economic development. Rural engineering, including rural land consolidation, reclamation, restoration, reallocation, improvement, and development, is the most direct and effective way to achieve rural sustainable poverty alleviation. This study clarifies the framework between land engineering and rural poverty alleviation, and introduces land engineering technologies, newly created land utilization practices, and the contributions to poverty alleviation in representative degraded land regions. Land engineering can increase land quantity, improve land quality, enhance land ecological function, and promote man-land system coupling. Further, it can erase rural poverty by increasing county revenue and households' income, lead to industrial development, and improve living environment. Specifically, degraded sandy land, gully land, hollowed construction land, and barren hilly land are transformed into productive land by improving the land structure. Innovated land engineering technologies and sustainable land utilization modes can provide the basic theories and reference approaches for rural poverty alleviation. Identifying obstacles to effective land and corresponding engineering practices are crucial to regional land exploitation and development, improving quality of life and alleviating rural poverty.

TI Poverty mitigation and anti-corruption campaigns: evidence from Chinese
   cities
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB In China, firms actively participate in poverty alleviation to comply with the national policy and to build political connections. Whether firms curry favor with the government by increasing spending on poverty alleviation is an interesting research question under the context of anti-corruption campaigns. Using hand-collected data from the period 2016-2018, we examine how anti-corruption campaigns have influenced corporate poverty alleviation spending at the city level. Our results show that anti-corruption campaigns are positively related to corporate poverty alleviation spending. We further identify two possible channels through which the anti-corruption campaign increases corporate poverty alleviation spending: (1) political connections and (2) stock price crash risk. Finally, we find that the effects of the anti-corruption campaign on corporate poverty alleviation spending are stronger in firms located in cities with lower degrees of marketization, a lower media index, and a higher poverty rate, as well as in firms receiving fewer government subsidies.

TI Pathways to breaking the poverty trap in Ethiopia: Investments in
   agricultural water, education, and markets
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Investments in agricultural water management should complement or strengthen the livelihood and coping systems of the rural poor, and should thus be instrumental for breaking the poverty trap in Ethiopia. Underdeveloped water resources constrain progress towards poverty reduction. We examine linkages and complementarities between agricultural water, education, markets and rural poverty through an empirical study using household level data from selected villages in southern Ethiopia. We show that investments in irrigation can contribute to poverty reduction, but the poverty reducing impacts of irrigation water are greater when human capital and rural markets are well developed. The size of landholding, access to irrigation water, on-farm land and water conservation practices, literacy of the household head, and years of education of adults are all significant determinants of household welfare, and thus potential pathways for reducing poverty. Expansion of cultivated land, particularly irrigated land, universal literacy, and an extra school year for adults all reduce poverty, but reductions in poverty are greater when irrigation is combined with universal literacy. These findings call for simultaneous investments in agricultural water, education, markets and related policy support measures for reducing poverty in smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia.

TI Embedding the poor into the industrial system: what we can learn from
   poverty alleviation through industrial development in China
SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB Poverty alleviation through industrial development in China contributes to the long-standing debate on how the poor could benefit from the development. It creates four industrial organizing approaches (i.e. households operating independently, intermediary organizations providing linkages, modern enterprise leading and asset income distribution) and three ways of participation for the rural poor (i.e. participating as petty commodity producers, wage workers and shareholders), in which productivity has been improved and production relations adjusted. While highlighting the specificity of China's situation, this paper argues for the more general implications of China's case for other developing countries due to its theoretical hybridity in addressing poverty alleviation and development.

AB Purpose Entrepreneurship has increasingly become a subject of interest for scholars and policymakers in an attempt to reduce poverty in agricultural communities across the world, especially in Africa. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the role of entrepreneurship in reducing poverty in agricultural communities of Lower Gweru, Zimbabwe. Design/methodology/approach Exploratory research design informed the data collection and analysis in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 owners of agribusinesses from various socio-economic backgrounds. The collected data from the field were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The results revealed that entrepreneurship plays a catalytic role in poverty reduction in agricultural communities through food security, skill transfer, employment creation, income generation and a decrease in food costs. Research limitations/implications This study focused on four agricultural communities in Lower Gweru which can limit the generalizability of the results to other contexts. Furthermore, this inquiry is a cross-sectional study that did not capture the longitudinal factors that can affect entrepreneurship and poverty reduction in agricultural communities. Practical implications The research outcomes have some practical implications for the Zimbabwean government and microfinance institutions in designing policies and programs to reduce poverty in marginalized agricultural communities. The findings are also useful for non-governmental organizations in designing, monitoring and evaluating poverty reduction programs in agricultural communities. Originality/value This study advances, contextualizes and enriches the body of knowledge concerning agricultural entrepreneurship and poverty reduction in the under-researched setting of agricultural communities. Notably, this study captures the African flavor in the agricultural entrepreneurship and poverty reduction discourse by focusing on the unique Zimbabwean context.

TI Poverty Alleviation in China: The Rise of State-sponsored Corporate
   Paternalism
SO CHINA PERSPECTIVES
AB Since taking office, president Xi Jinping's government has granted massive funding to what has become China's strongest poverty-reduction campaign ever. Based on the study of detailed budgets in eight rural counties, as well as ethnographic and interview data in a ninth county, this article explores how poverty alleviation programs shape the distribution of power and resources in rural China. It argues that poverty alleviation in rural China predominately focuses on infrastructure investment and support to the local economy, rather than on social insurance, education, and household subsidies. Support to local companies, the article argues, entails co-opting established enterprises, rather than supporting new entrepreneurship among poor households. Overall, the Chinese approach to rural poverty alleviation highlights the emergence of a state-sponsored corporate paternalism that strengthens local hierarchies of wealth and power.

TI Public Engagement and the Nunavut Roundtable for Poverty Reduction:
   Attempting to Understand Nunavut's Poverty Reduction Strategy
SO NORTHERN REVIEW
AB The 2009 Government of Nunavut Report Card, a review of the first ten years of Nunavut's existence, recommended the development of an anti-poverty strategy to help address severe social inequality in the territory. Between October 2010 and November 2011, the Government of Nunavut (GN), jointly with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), oversaw an extensive public engagement process that resulted in the creation of the Nunavut Roundtable for Poverty Reduction and the territory's poverty reduction strategy. The strategy suggests that the tension that exists between Inuit forms of governance and the model of public governance used today is the root cause of poverty. However, it does not offer an official definition of the term. Knowing the way in which poverty is perceived in Nunavut is key to understanding the direction of the territory's poverty reduction strategy. Drawing upon interviews conducted in Iqaluit and in Ottawa in 2015, as well as on records from the Nunavut Anti-Poverty Secretariat, this article examines how the territory's poverty reduction strategy was developed. It argues that the roundtable's participatory methods, closely aligned with principles of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, have fostered a politicized discussion about poverty that has resulted in Nunavut's poverty reduction strategy's focus on collaboration and healing.

TI Decomposing multidimensional child poverty and its drivers in the
   Mouhoun region of Burkina Faso, West Africa
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background The global poverty profile shows that Africa and Asia bear the highest burden of multidimensional child poverty. Child survival and development therefore depend on socioeconomic and environmental factors that surround a child.The aim of this paper is to measure multidimensional child poverty and underpin what drives it among children aged 5 to 18 years in a resource poor region of Burkina Faso. Methods Using primary data collected from a cross sectional study of 722 households in the Mouhoun region of Burkina Faso, the Alkire-Foster methodology was applied to estimate and decompose child poverty among children aged 5-18 years. Seven broad dimensions guided by the child poverty literature, data availability and the country's SDGs were used. A binary logistic regression model was applied to identify drivers of multidimensional child poverty in the region. Results The highest prevalence of deprivations were recorded in water and sanitation (91%), information and leisure (89%) followed by education (83%). Interestingly, at k = 3 (the sum of weighted indicators that a child must be deprived to be considered multidimensionally poor), about 97% of children are deprived in at least three of the seven dimensions. At k = 4 to k = 6, between 88.7 and 30.9% of children were equally classified as suffering from multidimensional poverty. The odds of multidimensional poverty were reduced in children who belonged to households with a formally educated mother (OR = 0.49) or stable sources of income (OR = 0.31, OR = 0.33). The results equally revealed that being an adolescent (OR = 0.67), residing in the urban area of Boromo (OR = 0.13) and rural area of Safane (OR = 0.61) reduced the odds of child poverty. On the other hand, child poverty was highest among children from the rural area of Ye (OR = 2.74), polygamous households (OR = 1.47, OR = 5.57 and OR = 1.96), households with an adult head suffering from a longstanding illness (OR = 1.61), households with debts (OR = 1.01) and households with above five number of children/woman (OR = 1.49). Conclusion Child poverty is best determined by using a multidimensional approach that involves an interplay of indicators and dimensions, bearing in mind its causation.

TI How renewable energy alleviate energy poverty? A global analysis
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The development of renewable energy industry is an important measure for countries to strengthen the construction of ecological civilization. Thus, to empirically investigate the underlying effect of renewable energy consumption on global energy poverty alleviation, we first assess the energy poverty composite index across the globe, and then explore whether the rapid development of renewable energy industry can help alleviate energy poverty. The regional heterogeneity and the mediating role of energy efficiency in the renewable energy-poverty alleviation nexus are also discussed. We conclude that: (1) Global energy poverty shows a significant trend of allevia.tion in the sample period, and rapid development of renewable energy industry can help alleviate energy poverty; (2) significant regional heterogeneity exists in the relationship between renewable energy and poverty alleviation. Only in European countries can increased renewable energy significantly reduce energy poverty; and (3) the mediating role of energy efficiency in the renewable energy-poverty alleviation nexus is significant; in other words, renewable energy not only directly alleviates global energy poverty, but also has a significant inhibiting effect on energy poverty by improving energy efficiency. Following the above three conclusions, we provide relevant policies about how to alleviate energy poverty and improve energy efficiency.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES
SO CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CHILD POVERTY
SE Childrens Issues Laws and Programs
AB This chapter examines poverty among children in the countries of South-Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States in the early 2000s.
   Three aspects of child poverty are examined - its demographic dimension, its regional dimension, and its relationship to migration. The most important findings from a policy point of view are the strong rural character of child poverty, and the relationship between child population density (at the level of the country, the sub-national region, and the household) and child poverty: where child population shares are higher, child poverty rates are also higher. Child population density needs to be seen more as a trigger to redistribution. In addition, the analysis finds that in some countries, poverty among children of single parents is reduced by their particular patterns of migration and remittance flows. However, parental migration to economically support children raises important questions about material well-being in relation to other aspects of child wellbeing. These warrant further analysis.

TI The Nexus between Poverty and the Environment: A Case Study of Lijiang,
   China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Highlighting the nexus between poverty and environment is essential to promote poverty alleviation and sustainable development. This study analyzed spatial differences and environmental factors influencing poverty incidence and reduction using spatial statistical methods and GeoDetector tools. It focused on Lijiang in the Hengduan Mountains of western China as the case area. The results indicate a notable decline in poverty incidence in most Lijiang villages during 2014-2018 under China's poverty alleviation strategy. However, there are distinct spatial differences for both poverty incidence and reduction. The main environmental factors affecting poverty incidence and reduction are available water storage and geological hazard risks. Socioeconomic factors such as administrative unit and distance to city center also play a key role. The anti-poverty policies in various administrative units have the most significant influence. However, existing policy formulation mainly considers elevation factor in mountainous areas. This study suggests that water resources and geological hazards should also be highly considered, and not only elevation. It is imperative to promote the construction of water conservancy facilities and improve the prevention and control of geological disasters. Moreover, targeted poverty alleviation should focus on, not only policy or socioeconomic factors, but also main environmental factors affecting poverty incidence and reduction.

TI Business, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Toward Poverty Reduction
SO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Poverty reduction has become a core subject for researchers across the social sciences from economics to finance, management and entrepreneurship. In general, the faster and more widespread economic growth in recent decades has enabled large numbers of people to move out of poverty such that extreme poverty has fallen to less than ten percent of world population. However, it is increasingly clear that while some countries and regions have seen dramatic improvement of poverty, there are other places with large numbers of people still in poverty that can greatly benefit from poverty alleviation efforts. Management scholars and economists increasingly recognize that entrepreneurship may offer a significant part of the solution to poverty around the world. A related focus regarding the ways in which poverty can be reduced in through entrepreneurship and new venture creation, however, how to link the key issues above with the current platform, network/digital and sharing economies, how to find new ways and new solutions to effectively reduce poverty in now political, economic and global contexts still needs to be better understood. This Special Issue has set the goals of publishing work that builds knowledge about thenature of poverty reduction and business, entrepreneurship and innovation activities in both developed and developing economies, as well as their models, antecedents and consequences related with the current platform.

TI Social Theory and Poverty Reduction with Special Attention to Nigeria:
   Social-Institutional Explanation of Small-Scale Financial Institutions
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB Do institutions and social capital provide a viable means for advancing the goals of poverty reduction programs in low capacity states? This question has particular importance for Nigeria and Africa as a whole because of the poor performance of poverty reduction programs despite domestic and global efforts to reduce poverty in the continent. In this paper, I assess the usefulness of the informational aspects of the new institutional economics and the social network method of social capital paradigm in reducing access, information and monitoring costs faced by the poor and service providers of micro-credit institutions in Nigeria. The general proposition of this paper is that poverty reduction can be promoted on the one hand, by designing programs to reflect some regularities (formal and informal rules and regulations) which best enhance benefits and mitigate costs faced by the poor for obtaining services, and on the other hand a mobilization of cohesive social relationships based on existing networks of semiautonomous units, that substitute for weak enforcement of contracts to reduce the service delivery costs to the poor.

The initiative sounds good, even noble, but becomes mired in divergent discourses and practices that ultimately fail to help the poor whom it targets. This research helps explicate the problems with BOP policy interventions that encourage profit seeking as a way to alleviate poverty

   China
SO CHINA ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB This paper examines some of the major driving forces of poverty reduction in China. Based on time series and cross-sectional provincial data, the determinants of rural poverty incidence are estimated. The results show that economic growth is an essential and necessary condition for nationwide poverty reduction. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. While economic growth played a dominant role in reducing poverty through the mid-1990s, its impact has diminished since that time. Beyond general economic growth, growth in specific sectors of the economy is also found to be effective in reducing poverty. The finding of our paper is consistent with the idea that poverty reduction in the future will need to be adjusted with more emphasis being given on direct targeting through helping the poor to increase their human capital and incomes.

TI Targeted poverty alleviation in China: Evidence from Jingdong e-commerce
   poverty alleviation
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB Inequalities within and between countries continue to grow as a result of globalization. Although traditional anti-poverty efforts from governments and NGOs have had their respective successes, poverty continues to exist in every country, particularly in rural areas where there are fewer resources to support socioeconomic development. Private enterprises may use their strengths, including market knowledge and accessibility to various resources, to develop innovative business models that can provide viable and effective solutions to social problems such as poverty. This article examines a case study of a poverty alleviation initiative by Jingdong (JD). The results indicate that JD utilizes industrial poverty alleviation to empower local enterprises. Through the use of education and training, finance, and employment support, JD builds an ecosystem that provides local enterprises high-quality employees and reliable logistics with which to conduct business. As a result, the JD model enables local enterprises to compensate farmers with sufficient wages that can reduce poverty and improve their well-being, creating a mutually beneficial solution for all stakeholders. The findings demonstrate the potential of a private enterprise to reduce poverty in a way that might not be otherwise independently achieved by government and NGOs.

AB Accurate poverty alleviation is of great strategic significance for the vast rural poor to get rid of poverty and achieve common prosperity. Through the questionnaire survey method, the poverty motivation and satisfaction with precision poverty alleviation of farmers in two poverty-stricken counties in south of Shaanxi were investigated. The study found that the main external causes of poverty among farmers in the two places are the single economic model and the channels for industrial income increase are not wide enough. The primary internal cause of poverty is the lack of skills. Poor farmers in the two counties have higher satisfaction with the government's accurate poverty alleviation work in identifying as well as assisting, but they are not satisfied with the current situation of accurate poverty alleviation's supervision, they also have low participation. In the implementation process of the precise poverty alleviation policies, there are some problems needed to be solved urgently, including insufficient poverty alleviation cooperation and low farmer's participation, etc. Based on the above findings, suggestions are proposed from four aspects about out of poverty accurately: optimizing rural environment, improving working mechanism, deepening industrial innovation and enhancing farmers' participation.

TI Is economic growth sufficient for poverty alleviation? Empirical
   evidence from Malaysia
SO CUADERNOS DE ECONOMIA-SPAIN
AB Malaysia's success story has been highlighted by the remarkable social transformation and poverty reduction accompanying rapid economic growth. Some three decades ago, more than half of the population was poor, the number of illiterates was high, and the average person could only hope to live until the age of 48. The proportion of poor people is currently down to 5.6 percent, 90 percent of adults are literate, and life expectancy is up to 68 years. Although Malaysia's population has increased from approximately 10 million in the 1960s to about 28 million in 2010, the number of poor people has dropped significantly during this period. This paper attempts to determine the empirical relationship and importance of growth for poverty reduction in Malaysia. The results show that growth explains much, but not all, about the evolution of poverty. Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient for poverty reduction, especially if the objective is rapid and sustained poverty reduction. This study proposes that if a policy's objective is focused on poverty alleviation, poverty reduction as well as economic growth should be simultaneously taken into account as the final target.

SO SOCIAL POLICY AND SOCIETY
AB The extent to which social protection programmes in general, and targeted programmes in particular, actually alleviate poverty has been a central issue in development debates for decades. The objective of this article is to contribute to the debate by empirically examining the poverty-alleviation effects of one of the largest targeted programmes in the world: the Minimum Living Standard Assistance (MLSA) or Dibao in China. Using newly available data on MLSA spending and a unique panel survey dataset covering the 1993 to 2009 period, this research investigates the impact of the MLSA on poverty alleviation. The analyses using fixed-effects and random-effects logit models and hierarchical liner models offer insights that go beyond the existing studies on the subject. Findings from the study confirm that targeted social protection programmes are an effective tool for reducing poverty.

TI Just End Poverty Now: The Case for a Global Minimum Income
SO BASIC INCOME STUDIES
AB Global GDP is more than 100 trillion dollars, yet 10 % of the world's population still live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 per day. No one should have to live like that: alleviating poverty is a minimal moral obligation implied by nearly every secular and religious moral system. Unfortunately, neither economic growth nor conventional international aid can be relied upon to fulfil this obligation. A global basic income programme that transferred $1 per day from the rich world to each poor person would eliminate extreme poverty directly and at negligible cost. It is the least we should do.

TI Financial development, institutional improvement, poverty reduction: The
   multiple challenges in West Africa
SO JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
AB Poverty continues to be one of the biggest difficulties confronting humanity today, and eradicating poverty has become one of the most difficult tasks facing developing countries in their drive for long-term development. Accordingly, this study assesses the moderating role of institutional quality (measured by rule of law, reg-ulation quality, control of corruption, government effectiveness, political stability, and voice and account-ability) in the finance-poverty nexus for a sample of 16 West African countries spanning 2002-2019. The findings show that finance (represented by domestic credit, and money supply) reduces poverty; however, the weak institutional quality reduces the positive effect of finance on poverty reduction. The study establishes that the institutional quality thresholds at which domestic credit could reduce poverty are: rule of law (0.6), reg-ulation quality (0.1), control of corruption (1.6), government effectiveness (0.1), and political stability (0.3) on the scale of -2.5-2.5. Finally, the institutional quality thresholds at which money supply could reduce poverty are: rule of law (2.5), regulation quality (0.3), control of corruption (2.0), government effectiveness (1.5), and political stability (1.4) on the scale of -2.5-2.5, whilst the interaction effect of domestic credit, money supply, and voice and accountability were insignificant. The study concludes that policymakers must enhance the institutional environment in West Africa to boost financial development to reduce poverty.(c) 2022 The Society for Policy Modeling.

AB The women's poverty alleviation is an important part of the whole poverty alleviation work in China. At present, the women's poverty alleviation pattern of multi-level, multi-sector linkage has been formed. Finance has played an important role in helping the poor women to alleviate their poverty. However, there are many problems such as the weak credit consciousness, the weak awareness of financial security and the backward insurance consciousness in the process of financial application because of the lack of financial education for the poor women. Although many efforts have been made in the poor women financial education, there are still many problems in poverty alleviation by women's financial education. For example, the ability to accept financial knowledge for the poor women is low, the implementation subject of the poor women's financial education is single, and so on. On the basis of analyzing the current situation and problems of the financial education for the poor women, the Countermeasures of enriching the financial education such as establishing the norms, expanding the implementation subjects, enlarging teachers, carrying out the content to meet the needs, enriching the way, establishing the evaluation mechanism of the poor women's financial education are put forward.

TI THE ROLE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS IN THE
   ALLEVIATION OF EXTREME POVERTY AND SPATIAL SEGREGATION OF ROMANI PEOPLE
   IN SZEGED
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL ANALYSIS
AB Even more emphasis is set on social capital in understanding, analyzing and planning poverty alleviation measures and policies. However, our understanding of the role of social capital in alleviating extreme poverty, enhancing social mobility and fighting spatial segregation, is still inadequate. Within the present study, we aim to examine and understand (1) the mechanisms that relate to social capital in the case of the segregated urban underclass and (2) the potential interventions for poverty alleviation concerning social capital. In order to examine the dynamics of poverty alleviation measures related to social capital, special attention is paid to the experiences of a cooperative network aimed at creating artificial bridging capital through the introduction of interpersonal relations locally between the middle class and underclass, the patronage network, which was initiated within a broader participatory action research (PAR) process. Our results show that bonding ties and related specific norms as tools for everyday survival easily overwrite system integration efforts for poverty alleviation and social mobility with long-term and uncertain benefits for the segregated urban underclass. In order to overcome this failure, social institutions should place more emphasis on developing meaningful interpersonal relations with the underclass since these might be able to provide personalized help, facilitation, and approximation of perspectives - all being vital for poverty alleviation and social mobility.

TI Oil Extraction and Poverty Reduction in the Niger Delta: A Critical
   Examination of Partnership Initiatives
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The combination of corporate-community conflicts and oil transnational corporations' (TNCs) rhetoric about being socially responsible has meant that the issue of community development and poverty reduction have recently moved from the periphery to the heart of strategic business thinking within the Nigerian oil industry. As a result, oil TNCs have increasingly responded to this challenge by adopting partnership strategies as a means to contribute to poverty reductions in their host communities as well as secure their social licence to operate. This paper critically examines the strengths and weaknesses of the different community development partnership (CDPs) initiatives employed by Shell, Exxon Mobil and Total to contribute to poverty reduction within their host communities in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Drawing on empirical data and critical analysis, the paper argues that while the CDP initiatives by SPDC, MPN and EPNL have the potential to contribute to community development, the failure to integrate negative injunction duties into existing partnerships means that the partnerships make no difference to how oil TNCs conduct their core business operation. Consequently, CDPs have had limited positive impact on poverty reduction in the Niger Delta. The paper concludes by examining the implications of the emerging issues for partnership and poverty reduction.

TI Off-farm employment and poverty alleviation in rural China
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Two phenomena in the history of China?s economic growth during the last four decades are the increase in the share of offfarm employment and the progress in poverty alleviation in rural China. Although both of them have been well documented in the literature, less is known about the linkage between the two. To better understand the role that off-farm employment has played in poverty alleviation in rural China is critically important not only for China but also for those countries that are trying to reduce poverty. Here, we examine the impact of off-farm employment on poverty alleviation in rural China. Using the data from two nationally representative household panel surveys (China National Rural Survey and China Rural Development Survey), this paper provides supporting evidence that off-farm employment contributes to poverty alleviation in rural China. Specifically, if household participation in off-farm employment increases by 10 percentage points, the likelihood for a nonpoor household to fall into poverty will decrease by 0.88 percentage point whereas the likelihood for a poor household to climb out of poverty will increase by 3.5 percentage points. In a word, off-employment can not only prevent rural residents to fall into poverty but also help those already in poverty climb out of it.

SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB As a substantial energy policy for poverty alleviation in China, photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects (PPAPs) have achieved a combination of poverty alleviation development, energy conservation and pollution emissions reduction. It is essential to explore how to improve the beneficiaries' satisfaction of the PPAPs, and thus to play a sustainable role in poverty alleviation. Based on the 1000 households' survey data collected in 41 poor villages in rural China. This paper explores the factors influencing beneficiaries' satisfaction using the entropy weight method (EWM), factor analysis, and ordinal regression model. The results indicate that:(1) there are some geographical differences in beneficiaries' satisfaction with PPAPs, and they are positively associated with the economic development performance of the poor areas; (2) beneficiaries' cognitive factors and environmental factors have disproportionate effects on the satisfaction, while the socio-demographic characteristics of beneficiaries have no significant influence on the comprehensive satisfaction.(c) 2022 International Energy Initiative.

AB This Voices from Practice note delineates institutional and non-institutional enablers of asset accumulation in Zimbabwe. It argues that in promoting asset accumulation and poverty reduction, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rely on the support of government ministries, partner NGOs, community volunteers, and community leaders. That perspective shifts and moves away from placing NGOs at the center of asset accumulation and poverty reduction efforts in communities. This article concludes that social work practice can be integral in contributing to poverty reduction when there are various stakeholders collaborating to enhance the welfare of communities at risk.

AB The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between economic growth expressed by GDP growth and poverty reduction. Studies on economic growth indicates that economic growth is essential for poverty reduction, especially when it leads to increase in employment and improvement in opportunities for productive activities among the people that are poor. Using a multiple regression analysis this paper therefore examines the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction in Slovakia by taking into consideration a time subscript. From the analysis, our findings indicate that there is a high correlation between the level of GDP, GNI and Household final consumption expenditure. It can be stated that only rarely (if ever) it is possible to reduce poverty without growth in GDP. On the other hand, economic growth does not necessarily lead to a decline in poverty. The link between economic growth and poverty reduction is just not automatic.

AB Precise poverty, alleviation of agricultural science and technology is the fundamental way to guide the sustainable development of poverty-stricken areas. FGT index was used to measure the incidence of agricultural science and technology poverty. We got three results based on the evaluation system in this paper. Firstly, the technical market turnover indicator shows highest incidence of poverty. Secondly, the service capacity is weak, especially, lack of agricultural science and technology leaders. Thirdly, R & D funding is insufficient, and the gap in the threshold gradually increased. It is suggested that the government should put science and technology poverty alleviation into the program of anti-poverty, which could improve the endogenous driving force of sustainable development after poverty alleviation.

AB The article provides the first estimates of prevalence and trends in child poverty amongst young carers aged 5-19 in the UK using specialized income data from the Family Resources Survey / the Households Below Average Income Survey. Looking across four key indicators, we find that child poverty rates were higher amongst young carers than other children based on 3 years pooled data for 2013/14-2015/16. The differences in the prevalence of child poverty amongst young carers and other children are statistically significant in relation to two indicators (anchored low income before housing costs, and a combined measure of low income and material deprivation). Young carers also appear to have fared worse than other children in terms of trends in child poverty outcomes over the period that coincided with the financial crisis, economic downturn and onset of austerity. Amongst young carers, there was a statistically significant increase in relative low income after housing costs of nine percentage points (from 24 to 33%) between 2005/07 and 2013/15. This compares with a two percentage point decline amongst other children. Multivariate findings confirm that trends in child poverty outcomes amongst young carers were highly differentiated from those of other children and that the association between child poverty and young caring status strengthened over the period under observation. Multivariate analysis further suggests that the increases in child poverty rates amongst young carers were not driven by purely "compositional" factors relating to demographic characteristics of the households in which young carers live and that labour market factors are particularly important in explaining the trends that are observed. Overall, the findings from the study raise concerns that young carers were disproportionately impacted by the patterns of stagnating real income and declining income from employment that characterized the period following the financial crisis, economic downturn and onset of austerity, whilst underlining the importance of housing costs as a factor in child poverty amongst young carers, and raising important questions regarding the ongoing effectiveness of social protection for this group.

TI The Effects of Payment for Environmental Services on Environmental
   Improvement and Poverty Reduction: A Meta-Regression Analysis
SO PROCESSES
AB Based on the empirical literature of the payments for environmental services (PES) projects for the environmental improvement and poverty reduction, this paper uses a meta-regression analysis method to study whether PES can achieve the effects of improving environmental quality and reducing poverty levels. For the meta-regression analysis, the literature was mainly searched by the Web of Science core journal database. The explanatory variables of meta-regression analysis are the hypothesis and related features of the models in the original literature by generally taking the binary dummy variables or categorical variables. The dependent variables used in this paper are environmental improvement and poverty reduction. The results show that PES projects based on private ownership rights are more conducive to poverty reduction and environmental improvement. If the country is a buyer of a PES project, it is more likely to achieve the effects of environmental enhancement and poverty alleviation. PES projects based on local conditions can also achieve a win-win situation for the two effects. The effects are more effective as policy implementation time is extended. The findings suggest that in developing countries, the government should set different PES projects according to different regions conditions, to promote project implementation through individual voluntary participation, and to achieve the dual purpose of environmental governance and poverty alleviation based on the expectation of long-term implementation of participant projects.

TI The Daily Life and Reality Behind Child Poverty in Sweden: Children's
   and Adolescents' Voices
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Today, approximately 12% of children growing up in Sweden are living in what could be defined as child poverty. Although the number of children living in poverty has slightly decreased during recent years, social exclusion and segregation between different groups in society have increased. The present study will shed a light on the reality of how children and adolescents living in poverty experience their daily lives. Analytically, the study explores how these experiences connect to different practices concerning child poverty. The study draws from an empirical and theoretical analysis of interviews with children and adolescents published in the Swedish Save the Children's report At the margin. The daily life behind the statistics of child poverty [Pa marginalen. Vardagen bakom barnfattigdomsstatistiken]. The results reveal that lack of material and financial resources creates social stigmatization for this group of children and adolescents; they have fewer possibilities to spend time with peers, and this quite often also results in self-exclusion. The children's and adolescents' narratives also indicate the importance of the social role of the school, here in relation to the school providing nutritious school lunches and free packed lunch for school excursions.

SO GOD-CONSCIOUS ORGANIZATION AND THE ISLAMIC SOCIAL ECONOMY
SE Islamic Business and Finance Series
AB In developing countries, there are many problems that can act as a barrier to economic growth. One of the major problems is the incidence of poverty. Poverty is a central problem of social and economic development. By using the Tawhidi String Relations (TSR) methodology that has been developed in this work by way of its Qur'anic conception and quantitative possibility through the methodical formalism in terms of circular causation relations, it is possible to show how such a comprehensive methodology and method can be applied to the study of poverty alleviation for socio-economic development. In this chapter, this comprehensive approach is applied to the case of circular causation interrelationships between the critical variables, namely, economic growth, investment, zakat expenditure and poverty alleviation. The incidence of poverty alleviation is measured in terms of the number of zakat recipients. Zakat is the mandatory payment by well-to-do Muslims for the alleviation of deprived social and economic conditions in society at large. It has specific rules of collection and distribution, as mentioned in the Qur'an. Among these targeted directions of zakat expenditure is poverty alleviation. Yet, in addition, the channel through which poverty alleviation is attained involves zakat expenditure to assimilate the abject poor in the growth and spending cycles of a prosperous society.

What is the key channel, if any, by which agriculture is benefiting the poor in Chile that would be worthwhile to promote in other countries ? By answering these questions we expand the literature on poverty and composition of growth by proposing a methodology that allows to disentangle the mechanisms by which agricultural growth can be poverty reducing. We find that in Chile agriculture plays a large role in reducing poverty, and most of this effect is channeled through the labor market.

SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB An energy poverty policy simulation model is developed to make integrated decision and optimize China's energy poverty alleviation. In the model, system dynamic modeling is used to investigate the time-varying behavior of energy poverty system over time, and scenario analysis is carried to test and determine the most efficient scenario. The results show that energy poverty will move toward a sustainable alleviation from 2021 to 2030. Compared with 2011, the energy poverty index in scenario I - VI will decrease by 47.98%, 62.08%, 43.19%, 53.31%, 62.22% and 88.42% in 2030. Both employment and financial expenditure have a significant positive effect on energy poverty alleviation, while energy structure adjustment plays a double-sided role in alleviating energy poverty. Combination strategy is the most efficient scenario, where China could achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 of providing clean and affordable energy access to all by 2031.

TI Measuring Improvement of Economic Condition in State-Owned Forest Farms'

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB An important policy cornerstone for China to reduce poverty includes China's goal of achieving complete poverty alleviation in its state-owned forest farms by 2020. This study describes and documents the poverty reduction effect in impoverished Chinese state-owned forest farms. Based on a sample of 4855 state-owned forest farms in 31 provinces in China from 2008 to 2017, this paper uses the difference-in-difference method to study the dynamic process of poverty reduction by policies for impoverished state-owned forest farms. The results show that the implementation of the policy significantly promoted the economic development of impoverished state-owned forest farms and caused the treatment group to increase by approximately 10.6% over the control group. Moreover, the establishment of a list of impoverished state-owned forest farms had an indirect impact on the economic performance of forest farms, through channels such as infrastructure poverty alleviation, human capital investment, and per capita income of forest farm employees. Additionally, the effects of the policy on non-impoverished counties were stronger than that on impoverished counties, and impoverished state-owned forest farms may not appear in impoverished counties. The degree of financial dependence of the local government had a significant positive impact on the economic development of impoverished state-owned forest farms. The effects of the policy on different forest farms were heterogeneous. Our study provides recommendations for the future development of impoverished Chinese state-owned forest farms and for the improvement of poverty alleviation efficiency.

AB The education-related allowances as part of the governmental social policy are aimed to protect the living standard of families with children in education and, consequently, to promote the access of poor children to education. Our paper is focused on the effectiveness of education-related allowances for child poverty reduction in Romania, which is the European Union country with the highest child poverty incidence. A considerable amount of Romanian families with children in education benefit of universal or means-tested allowances which are linked to the educational enrolment of their children, but a comprehensive evaluation of their effect on poverty reduction among them is still lacking. The education-related allowances have not been on the governmental agenda until recently, when during the economic crisis, after cutting the amounts of many other social benefits in order to cope with the increasing fiscal deficit, the education-related allowances became a very important instrument for helping families with children to keep them in school. Therefore, we attempt to assess the extent to which these social benefits could be beneficial for the enhancement of the living standard of poor families with children, by using a microsimulation framework. Based on EU-SILC microdata for Romania and using the EUROMOD tax-benefit model as a simulation tool, we evaluate the influence of education-related benefits on the disposable income at household level. We calculate the poverty indicators (at-risk-of poverty rate, poverty gap) in the presence and absence of education-related benefits and compare them in terms of relative change.

TI On-Site Energy Consumption Technologies and Prosumer Marketing for
   Distributed Poverty Alleviation Photovoltaic Linked to Agricultural
   Loads in China
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In China, photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects play important role in promoting social and economic development in poverty-stricken areas. They can help stabilizing and increasing incomes of the poor. However, poverty alleviation photovoltaics are mainly connected to the rural distribution network in large numbers, which have a greater impact on the safe and stable operation of the distribution network, making the rural distribution network difficult to solve the problem of collecting and consuming distributed photovoltaic energies on-site. Meanwhile, photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects mainly rely on subsidies from the government and power grids, and the prosumer marketing methods are inadequate. In this paper, an effective on-site consumption technology for photovoltaic power generation linked to agricultural load for poverty alleviation is discussed, together with new energy management and planning technologies for stable two-way energy flow between photovoltaic power generation and rural distribution networks, which can increase the photovoltaic power supply radius, and deal with load fluctuations, and perform precise reactive power control of agricultural load. Furthermore, a prosumer marketing that can simultaneously create maximum economic benefits for power grid and poverty alleviation targets is proposed. The detailed economic benefits are calculated for a demonstration project in Funan county, Anhui province, China.

AB Aiming at the actual problems encountered in the specific poverty alleviation work, this article designs a management system specifically designed for poverty alleviation workers to solve poverty alleviation data sharing and online editing and uploading of poverty alleviation logs. Based on the neural network and network characteristics, a system model is constructed, and the application of structural disturbance theory in dynamic networks is studied. Moreover, in this study, the dynamic change information between time-series networks is taken into account for structural disturbances. By combining structural disturbances and local topology, a new similarity measurement method suitable for dynamic networks is proposed. In addition, this study proposes an algorithm based on evolutionary clustering and density clustering to detect the structure of dynamic communities. Finally, this study compares the proposed method with the classic method in the artificial network and the real network and analyzes the performance of the research model through data analysis. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper has good performance.

TI Foreign aid and poverty reduction: A review of international literature
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This main objective of this paper is to present a synthesis of the empirical literature on the effectiveness of foreign aid on poverty reduction. This is done through a review of empirical studies on the impact and effectiveness of official development assistance (ODA) or foreign aid on poverty reduction. The study divided the reviewed empirical literature into two broad groups: the studies which used non-monetary measures of poverty and those that used monetary measures of poverty. The survey results show that foreign aid has a positive impact on poverty, as reported by the majority of studies in both the non-momentary and monetary measures of poverty groups. This means that in general, foreign aid reduces poverty, irrespective of the type of poverty measures used. Of the studies which showed that foreign aid was effective in reducing poverty, it was highlighted that: (i) democracy enhances the effectiveness of aid; (ii) aid targeted at pro-poor public expenditures such as agriculture, education, health and other social services was effective; and (iii) aid disbursed in production sectors, infrastructure and economic development was more effective in reducing poverty. These channels should, therefore, be considered when making policy decision on aid allocation.

SO VETERINARIA ITALIANA
AB Few studies have explicitly examined the linkages between human health, animal disease control and poverty alleviation. This paper reviews the contribution that veterinary medicine can make to poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis attempts to explore aspects of this contribution under five themes: food production; food safety; impact and control of zoonotic infections; promotion of ecotourism; and environmental protection. While these areas of human activity have, more or less, fallen under the influence of the veterinary profession to varying degrees, we attempt to unify this mandate using a 'One Health' narrative, for the purpose of providing clarity on the linkages between the veterinary and other professions, livestock production and poverty alleviation. Future opportunities for improving health and reducing poverty in the context of developing African countries are also discussed. We conclude that veterinary science is uniquely positioned to play a key role in both poverty reduction and the promotion of health, a role that can be enhanced through the reorientation of the profession's goals and the creation of synergies with allied and related professions.

Big data technology is a new technology that has slowly emerged in recent years. The use of big data technology to create a visual platform for rural poverty alleviation is a relatively new idea at this stage. And we use the Map-reduce-based big data missing value filling algorithm, which is designed to solve the data loss phenomenon in the query process.

The general body of existing research provides conflicting evidence, depending on context, poverty reduction and empowerment may or may not be partially achieved. Research on the effects of context on microcredit is limited in Ghana. Based on focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with stakeholders, the contextual factors that affect microcredit for poverty reduction among women are explored. The findings of this study suggest that the orthodox use of social collateral through group lending doesn't fully account for why some microlending programs are effective, and others are not. Contextual factors appear to make the difference.

AB Poverty reduction has become a top goal in the socio-economic development strategies of countries and a topic of interest for researchers. A number of prior empirical studies have identified the importance of financial inclusion to poverty reduction. However, most of these studies assess the effect of financial inclusion on income poverty reduction. There are relatively few studies evaluating the impact of financial inclusion, especially in terms of household use of financial products and services, on multidimensional poverty reduction. This study uses a multivariate probit model with a dataset from Vietnam to estimate the effect of financial inclusion in terms of household use of financial products and services and other factors on multidimensional poverty. The results show that financial inclusion reduces multidimensional poverty. Specifically, households owning bank accounts, having savings at banks, using debit cards, credit cards, or investing in stocks or bonds are less likely to fall into multidimensional poverty. Based on the findings, we provide several recommendations for policymakers to increase the level of households' use of financial products and services.

TI Chairman's Communist Party of China member status and targeted poverty
   alleviation: Evidence from China
SO PLOS ONE
AB Based on the data of Chinese listed private companies from 2016 to 2020, this paper investigates the influence of the Chairman's member status of Communist Party of China (CPC) on targeted poverty alleviation. The research results demonstrate that the Chairman's CPC member status of private companies significantly increases the companies' willingness and the amounts of investment in poverty alleviation. The construction of the CPC organization can strengthen the role of the chairman's Communist Party of China member status in promoting targeted poverty alleviation. The conclusions are still valid through robustness tests, such as substituting dependent variables, adjusting the sample range, and PSM-paired samples. In addition, the Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable is used to deal with endogenous problems.

TI Society to cell: How child poverty gets "Under the Skin" to influence
   child development and lifelong health
SO DEVELOPMENTAL REVIEW
AB Almost one in three children globally live in households lacking basic necessities, and 356 million of these children were living in extreme poverty as of 2017. Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic further increase rates of child poverty due to widespread job and income loss and economic insecurity among families. Poverty leads to unequal distribution of power and resources, which impacts the economic, material, environmental and psychosocial conditions in which children live. There is evidence that poverty is associated with adverse child health and developmental outcomes in the short term, as well as increased risk of chronic diseases and mental illnesses over the life course. Over the past decade, advances in genomic and epigenomic research have helped elucidate molecular mechanisms that could in part be responsible for these long-term effects. Here, we review evidence suggestive of biological embedding of early life poverty in three, interacting physiological systems that are potential contributors to the increased risk of disease: the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, the brain, and the immune system. We also review interventions that have been developed to both eliminate childhood poverty and alleviate its impact on pediatric development and health. Pertinently, studies estimate that the costs of child poverty, calculated by increased healthcare expenditures and loss of productivity, are immense. We argue that investing in child development by reducing child poverty has the potential to improve the health and well-being at the population level, which would go a long way towards benefiting the economy and promoting a more just society by helping all individuals reach their full potential.

TI Are Poverty Alleviation and Carbon Reduction Parallel Paths? Empirical
   Research on the Interaction Between Poverty Alleviation and Carbon
   Emissions
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB Consolidating the results of poverty alleviation and achieving carbon neutrality are serious challenges for global sustainable development, and it is essential to explore the relationship between these goals, and then offer scientific responses. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2010 to 2019, this paper conducted the 2SLS model by compromising the merits of the Regression Discontinuity principle with the STIRPAT model to study the interaction between poverty alleviation and carbon reduction. The study found that: (1) the implementation of poverty alleviation aggravates the problem of carbon emissions, and the main mechanism is that poverty alleviation promotes consumption and production by increasing the wealth of farmers, thereby increasing carbon emissions. (2) Carbon reduction weakens the achievement of poverty alleviation significantly, but the mitigation effect presents an "inverted U"-shaped curve, which first increases and then wanes. (3) Farmers' income and the development of rural transportation play a role in acting on the negative effects of carbon reduction. By integrating poverty theory and energy management, this article reveals the complex relationship between two important policies in China and offers relevant policy recommendations, which will not only promote the advancement of rural revitalization but also promote global sustainable development.

AB This article examines the role of education in alleviating poverty in a context of high rates of income inequalities. It will argue that despite public attention on the incomes of top earners, education policy has been largely silent on the education of elites. Rather it has focused on extending opportunities to those at the other end of the income distribution. By improving school performance and widening access to higher education, it is claimed that poverty can be alleviated by increasing rates of social mobility from disadvantaged families. This article will highlight several problems with this analysis that amount to a fundamental contradiction at the heart of education policy as a route to poverty reduction.

TI Estimating the impact of minimum wages on poverty across ethnic groups
   in Malaysia
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB This paper examines the potential impacts of minimum wages on poverty alleviation in Malaysia by paying specific attention to its impacts between major ethnic groups. Our model assesses both the impacts on total incomes (and its distribution) and expenditures caused by price increases in response to higher labour costs. For all ethnic groups, results show that minimum wages lead to a reduction in poverty. Poverty reduction is mainly explained by an increase in total income rather than a shift in income distribution. Among the ethnic groups, poverty for ethnic Indians is reduced the most by increases in minimum wages compared to that of the Malays and Chinese. The differences in poverty reduction can be explained by the limitation of minimum wages to promote wages of informal workers among the Malays and Chinese. Therefore, minimum wages could be more effective as a poverty reduction tool if informal workers are covered in the scope. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Impact of Qard-al-Hasan (interest-free loan) program in reducing
   multidimensional poverty: an evidence from the southwest Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND
   MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of Qard-al-Hasan (QH) or interest-free loan in reducing multidimensional poverty through examining Fael Khair Waqf (FKW) program as a case. Design/methodology/approach A Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) approach has been used in this study, which was conducted over 1,600 households including 1,200 program households in 40 villages and 400 control households in 20 villages of 8 districts in the south-western region of Bangladesh. Findings It is found that 38.5% of sample population was multidimensional poor with deprivation of above the cutoff score. However, FKW participants were relatively less multidimensional poor. It was 35.3%. Hence, it is argued that the FKW is an effective program in terms of poverty reduction as it has contributed to higher economic outcomes for their participating households. The econometric result also suggests that the likelihood of the participants of FKW to be MPI poor is around 1.5 times lower than the nonparticipants, and the result is significant at 1% level. This indicates that program has a positive impact in reducing multidimensional poverty. Practical implications The analysis in this paper would fill the literature gap by investigating the link between application of QH and poverty alleviation. It will also guide academicians, researchers and decision-makers to design evidence-based policy to alleviate poverty. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no empirical work in Bangladesh on the effectiveness of QH in poverty reduction considering an MPI approach. Hence, this study is a unique contribution to the literature of Islamic social finance.

TI Targeted poverty alleviation and land policy innovation: Some practice
   and policy implications from China
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Poverty is the common challenge faced by the international community. The human society has never ceased to struggle against poverty. China was once the developing country with the largest rural poor population in the world. Facing the decreasing effect of economic input to poverty reduction, land policy innovations could contribute to promoting poverty alleviation, particularly in China, where the defects in policy making is regarded as a major factor in rural poverty. This study explores the institutional innovation of China's poverty alleviation since 2013 and further reveals the mechanism behind land policy innovation promoting the targeted poverty alleviation based on a case study of Songjiagou village of Fuping county, Hebei province. We found that the Chinese central government has innovated the mechanism for the TPA to lift the remaining rural poor out of poverty by 2020 as scheduled. Implementing the TPA could confront the labor, capital and land dilemmas. Combined land policy innovations and land engineering with the ex situ poverty alleviation relocation (ESPAR) can help to break the institutional barriers. We argue that land policy innovations and the ESPAR not only contributes to poverty reduction and improve living conditions of the poor, but also needs to guard against its potential risk. These findings can provide policymakers with a sound scientific basis for poverty reduction planning and decisions in China and other poor countries.

TI Child Poverty Among Hong Kong Ethnic Minorities
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper analyzes the data from the Population Census of 2011 to identify the characteristics of poor ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong and the factors that are associated with child poverty among these ethnic minorities. The results show that the child poverty level varies between different ethnic groups and that ethnic minorities from developing nations are likely to have a higher poverty level. In particular, Pakistani children have the highest poverty rate among all ethnic groups. The results also show that Pakistani, Nepalese, and Mixed (Chinese and Asian) nationalities have a higher child poverty rate than that of Chinese individuals who constitute the majority of the Hong Kong population. The main reason for this is that, unlike their Chinese counterparts, some of these ethnic minority households have not benefited from their own human capital or their length of exposure in the local society in Hong Kong. And even if they have benefited, the positive impact of these factors on ethnic minority households was much weaker compared to that of Chinese households. These results suggest that ethnic minorities need to be categorized as a separate group in order to assess their specific needs, and assimilation policies, especially support on Chinese language learning, need to be an integral part of the government's poverty reduction strategy to reduce child poverty among ethnic minorities.

TI The Frontiers of Poverty Reduction in Emerging Asia
SO FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB It is difficult, if not impossible, to satisfactorily answer the question 'Why does poverty persist?' Nonetheless, there appear to be two approaches that can provide a useful start. One alternative is to examine why poverty (and extreme forms of it) continue to persist in the poorest countries of the world, mainly in SubSaharan Africa. The other, which is the focus on this article, is to examine a set of factors or reforms that have worked in reducing poverty in middle-income countries of the 'Emerging South' and the challenges these countries continue to face in distributing the benefits of economic growth and addressing persistent levels of poverty within their borders. We aim to better understand successful attempts to reduce poverty in a selected few emerging economies - India, China and Vietnam - by examining the role of specific types of reforms and initiatives in shaping and determining action by national governments to reduce poverty. Do some of these emerging economies advocate and adopt different poverty-reduction policies? If so, what, how and why? And to what extent can some of these poverty-reduction models be usefully applied in other developing country contexts? We then identify and discuss two broad sets of frontiers of research and policy-making on poverty in emerging Asia - environmental challenges and growing inequality - that require considerable attention if India, China and Vietnam are to experience continued economic growth and poverty reduction.

TI DO REMITTANCES MITIGATE POVERTY? AN EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM 15 SELECTED
   ASIAN ECONOMIES
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This paper examines the impact of remittances on poverty alleviation in 15 selected Asian economies. Remittances have been identified as a potential source of income for households in developing countries and a means of reducing poverty. Using panel data from 2000 to 2020, we estimate the effect of remittances on poverty levels in these economies, controlling for other relevant factors such as GDP per capita, inflation rate and population growth. Our results suggest that remittances have a significant and negative impact on poverty levels in these economies, indicating that remittances play a crucial role in poverty reduction. The findings also reveal that the effect of remittances on poverty reduction varies across economies, with some economies experiencing a stronger poverty-reducing effect than others. The findings highlight the potential benefits of policies aimed at facilitating the flow of remittances and ensuring their effective use in reducing poverty in developing countries.

TI Combating Child Poverty? A Multilevel Assessment of Family Policy

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
AB This study analyses the links between family policy institutions and poverty in households with pre-school children ill 21 old and new welfare democracies. New institutional information which enables a separation of different family policy dimensions is combined with micro data from the Luxembourg income Study. Through statistical multilevel modelling, individual- and country-level data are combined in a simultaneous analysis of their relationships to child poverty risks. The results show that family policy transfers arc related to lower child poverty risks at the micro level. However, the mechanisms by which Such transfers reduce poverty vary by type of family support. Support to dual-earner families operates by enabling both parents to work and raise market income, while support to more traditional family structures in some instances has a more direct effect oil poverty risks. The analysis also renders support to the hypothesis that dual-earner transfers also alleviate poverty most effectively among single-mother households.

TI Multidimensional Child Poverty in Vietnam from a Longitudinal
   Perspective-Improved Lives or Impoverished Conditions?
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Despite a rapid expansion of the bodies of research on the measurement of multidimensional poverty, chronic poverty and child poverty, little attention has been paid to the longitudinal aspects of multidimensional poverty. Even less evidence is available about longitudinal multidimensional child poverty. This paper combines these strands of research, using household survey data from 2004, 2006 and 2008 from Vietnam to analyze cross-sectional poverty trends and longitudinal poverty dynamics. The purpose of this study is three-fold as it (i) examines the lives of children in Vietnam and considers changes in their living conditions in the first decade of the 21st century; (ii) assesses various hypotheses drawn from the chronic multidimensional poverty literature; and (iii) presents an explorative study of the investigation of child poverty from a longitudinal perspective using a multidimensional approach. Main conclusions suggest that the large reduction of child poverty in Vietnam has been unequal and that a sizeable proportion of children remain locked into poverty. Theoretically, this paper finds that characteristics of chronic versus transient poor children are similar and that the association between poverty depth and duration is not strong enough to consider one measure a proxy for the other.

TI The Impact of State Minimum Wages on Child Poverty in Female-Headed
   Families
SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY
AB Several state governments set minimum wage levels above the federal level, and some automatically index them to inflation. This article uses the variation in real minimum wages both over time and across states to examine how minimum wages have affected poverty rates of children living in female-headed households. These children are among the most vulnerable members of society and are increasingly likely to feel the impact of such policy actions due to the growing presence of their mothers in low-wage labor markets. Evidence based on state-level panel data for the years 1991 to 2002 shows that minimum wages have significantly reduced child poverty rates, after controlling for a number of other potentially relevant factors. These findings are robust to alternative measures of poverty, sample definition, estimation technique, and variable selection.

SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB Using the last three waves of the rural household surveys conducted by the Chinese Household Income Project in 2007, 2013, and 2018, this paper focuses on changes in poverty in rural China. The paper decomposes poverty change into the growth effect and the inequality effect, and also decomposes the contributions of income components, concentrating particularly on income from public transfers. Economic growth had a very significant poverty reduction effect for both absolute and relative poverty, but the inequality effect mostly offset it; in total, absolute poverty reduced significantly, and relative poverty increased from 2007 to 2018. Local wage income became the main contributor to both absolute and relative poverty reduction, replacing household agricultural operational income, and the contribution of wage income from migration declined. Public transfers effectively reduced absolute poverty but not relative poverty.

TI Effectiveness of social welfare programmes on poverty reduction and
   income inequality in China
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN PUBLIC POLICY
AB Using the 1989 and 2009 China Health and Nutrition Surveys, this paper examines the effects of social welfare programmes on poverty and income inequality in China in 1989 and 2009. The findings indicate that social welfare programmes have played an important role in poverty reduction, reducing poverty rates by approximately 32%. The effects on income inequality, however, were reversed. For example, the ratio of top to bottom income quintiles grew after government transfers, suggesting that the programmes benefitted higher income families more than their counterparts. The inequalities among regions and income quintiles also increased over time.

TI Sustainability of photovoltaic poverty alleviation in China: An
   evolutionary game between stakeholders
SO ENERGY
AB China has entered the crucial period of poverty alleviation. Photovoltaic poverty alleviation, as an ideal mode of poverty alleviation, can not only provide stable income for poor households, but also promote the development of new energy industries. However, several issues happening in some regions may seriously hamper the sustainable development of photovoltaic poverty alleviation. For this reason, we establish a tripartite evolutionary game model to simulate and analyze the behavior strategies of PV enterprises, poor households, and the government, and the relevant influencing factors. Moreover, the game model is verified by empirical analysis. Results demonstrate that: (i) there are four evolutionary stable strategies for the photovoltaic project, among which the initiative support of PV enterprises, the participation of poor households and less supervision of the government is a more appropriate choice. (ii) a threshold effect exists in relevant parameters, which may change the evolutionary stable strategies of PV enterprises or poor households. (iii) the initial willingness of PV enterprises, poor households and the government affects the convergence speed of the evolutionary stable strategy. (iv) increasing performance-based subsidies appropriately and perfecting the income distribution mechanism can guarantee the sustainable development of photovoltaic projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A biblical approach to the reduction of child poverty in Anambra state,
   Nigeria
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB Child poverty reduction is one of the most important and urgent tasks that requires attention in most regions of the world, nations and Anambra state specifically. The population of impoverished children is progressively increasing in Nigeria because of economic recession and poor security situations that lead to displacement and death of their parents. Although children constitute half of the entire population, commensurate attention is not given to them to match the dimensions of poverty they face. This study argued that child poverty is multidimensional, evidenced in lack of safe drinking water, adequate nutrition, shelter, decent sanitation, medical advice or health services (immunisations) and education, to mention a few. The article highlighted the laudable efforts of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Anambra government and maintained that multiple strategies can help in solving this problem. To complement these efforts, the enforcement of biblical policies or principles about children's rights would in no small measure reduce child poverty. It was concluded that a proper repositioning of children would be matched with implementation of biblical strategies. Biblical intervention could help children socially, mentally and psychologically and in their general well-being. Biblical principles would erase wrong socio-cultural notions about children.

SO JOURNAL OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
AB This paper develops child-specific multidimensional poverty measures employing data from General Household Surveys (GHSs) of 2002 and 2014, and uses the measures to assess change in child poverty over time. The measures presented draw on the Alkire-Foster methodology. However, it was adapted to include dimensions and indicators, which reflect the unique experiences of children aged 0-17 years, in post-apartheid South Africa. The results indicate a reduction in child poverty over time, from 0.150 in 2002 to 0.090 in 2014. However, the proportion of children who are deprived in at least one-third of some of the weighted indicators, in both time periods, remains high.

TI Measuring human rights? Vernacularisation and paradoxes of measurement
   in child poverty estimation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AB During the last two decades, UNICEF has led efforts to measure Child Poverty globally as well as in various regions and countries. These efforts have been explicitly grounded on a human rights perspective and guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this paper, some of the issues raised by these endeavours are analysed. The paper explicitly uses, and expands, Sally Engle Merry's framework of vernacularisation to assess these efforts. Thus, it is organised in three sections. First, a review of criticisms to the broader project of 'human rights measurement' is offered. This includes aspects of vernacularisation, paradoxes of measurement, and the tension between universal standards and particular specificities. Secondly, a brief description of Child Poverty measurement is provided, with a focus on developments and debates of the last 20 years. This is the case study on which Merry's framework is applied. This is done in the third section. Based on this analysis, practical recommendations for future research on Child Poverty measurement based on human rights are discussed in the concluding section.

TI The impact of urbanization on poverty reduction: An evidence from
   Vietnam
SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB Poverty is a global socio-economic phenomenon. It is always a problem in all countries include developing countries and developed countries. In Vietnam, the poverty rate has been decreasing while the urbanization has happened rapidly over the past 20 years. Handling the dual problems of urbanization and poverty is important to be able to attain sustainable development. Therefore, this study is to analyze the impact of urbanization on poverty reduction in Vietnam. Using Driscoll and Kraay's method and D-GMM method to estimate the provinces' panel data in the period 2006-2016, we confirm that there exists a U-shape relationship between the level of urbanization and the poverty level in Vietnam. Moreover, the estimated thresholds of urbanization from the perspective of poverty reduction are 40.19% and 43.68% in the static and dynamic model, respectively. In addition, our results exhibit that the gross regional domestic product, human capital, and agricultural value have the effect of reducing poverty, but government spending and export value increases the poverty rate in Vietnam. The paper has relevant implications for policymakers.

TI Research on targeted land poverty alleviation patterns based on the
   precise identification of dominant factors of rural poverty: a case
   study of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, China
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Poverty is a common problem faced by various social and economic forms. Eliminating poverty is a major issue of common concern and research all over the world. Land policies for poverty alleviation are an effective means of affecting land agriculture development, increasing the productivity of cultivated land, and promoting growth in farmers' income and production. In recent years, it has played an important role in promoting poverty alleviation in poverty-stricken areas. However, the poverty alleviation needs of township units have not been precisely identified, and one-size-fits-all land policies are unable to effectively allocate poverty alleviation resources. Consequently, the actual efficiency of policies has been severely restricted, leading to regional differences in poverty alleviation. In response to this bottleneck, this study takes Siyang County in Jiangsu Province as a case study and adopts the geographical detector model to diagnose and identify the spatial differentiation characteristics and dominant factors of poverty and in various townships. The results can be summarised as 'four dominant factors of poverty-four regional types of poverty townships-four targeted land poverty alleviation patterns'. Detailed results are as follows: the dominant factors affecting differentiation of rural poverty in Siyang County are labour, technology, land resources, and financial support. The various townships of the county were thus classified into four types according to the main factor affecting poverty: labour-constrained, land-constrained, capital-constrained, and technique-constrained, and proposed four targeted land poverty alleviation patterns for the different constraint types and then to improve the effectiveness of land development policies to successfully achieve precise poverty alleviation and reinforce strategies revitalising rural communities.

SO CHILD WELFARE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB The general objectives of this study are to identify and analyze the factors that contribute to child poverty and then quantify inequalities in child welfare for Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, and Togo. Our methodology is based on the multidimensional poverty approach, with the results showing that the following factors explain child poverty in these countries: access to vitamin A; use of iodized salt; breast feeding; vaccinations against polio, diphtheria, measles, and yellow fever; and the prevalence of illnesses such as diarrhea, bronchitis, fevers, and other respiratory ailments. An absolute child poverty line is defined in order to determine the number of children living in poverty, with the results suggesting that 19.4% of children in Togo. 21.1% in Cote d'Ivoire, 29.0% in Guinea-Bissau and 49.7% of children in Niger live in poverty.

TI The role of foreign aids and income inequality in poverty reduction: A
   sustainable development approach for Africa?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB In the last decades, international interventions mostly through foreign aids have consistently been directed toward sustainable development objectives such as reduction of poverty in African countries. Thus, this study investigates the effect of foreign aids and income inequality in poverty reduction in Africa for 1990-2016. The novelty lies in the investigation of the effectiveness of aid remittances to Africa from the United Nations and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which has previously been overlooked in extant studies. By using the system Generalized Method of Moments, the study showed that the interaction of inequality with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funds and OECD Official Development Assistance is not statistically significant. Meanwhile, the interventions from the UNDP funds and OECD Official Development Assistance statistically yield significant and expected results of reducing poverty in the poor continent. However, the study surprisingly failed to establish that remittances from the UNDP have significantly mitigated poverty in Africa. Importantly, this study presents a significant policy guide for the governments and the stakeholders and recommends that the donor agencies adopt poverty-reduction, and income distribution-based criteria for the allocation of their resources to reduce poverty in the continent.

AB Poverty reduction strategies show promise for more transparent and rational delivery of public services to meet the needs of Africa's rural poor. An analysis was conducted to determine how closely Kenya's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) matches with the problems and priorities articulated by residents of 80 rural communities in 10 districts of Western Kenya. The results suggest that there was a good match between national PRSP priorities and priorities generated from the 80 rural communities, but poor matches between district level PRSP priorities and community priorities, and between national PRSP priorities and the national PRSP implementation plan. The results imply the need for a stronger multiscale approach to poverty reduction, with special emphasis on the mesoscales of locations and districts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of child poverty and related early life experiences on adult health outcomes and patterns of aging has become a central focus of child health research and advocacy. In this article a critical review of this proliferating literature and its relevance to child health programs and policy are presented. This literature review focused on evidence of the influence of child poverty on the major contributors to adult morbidity and mortality in the United States, the mechanisms by which these associations operate, and the implications for reforming child health programs and policies. Strong and varied evidence base documents the effect of child poverty and related early life experiences and exposures on the major threats to adult health and healthy aging. Studies using a variety of methodologies, including longitudinal and cross-sectional strategies, have reported significant findings regarding cardiovascular disorders, obesity and diabetes, certain cancers, mental health conditions, osteoporosis and fractures, and possibly dementia. These relationships can operate through alterations in fetal and infant development, stress reactivity and inflammation, the development of adverse health behaviors, the conveyance of child chronic illness into adulthood, and inadequate access to effective interventions in childhood. Although the reviewed studies document meaningful relationships between child poverty and adult outcomes, they also reveal that poverty, experiences, and behaviors in adulthood make important contributions to adult health and aging. There is strong evidence that poverty in childhood contributes significantly to adult health. Changes in the content, financing, and advocacy of current child health programs will be required to address the childhood influences on adult health and disease. Policy reforms that reduce child poverty and mitigate its developmental effects must be integrated into broader initiatives and advocacy that also attend to the health and well-being of adults.

   Samples in Luquan County
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Poverty alleviation is the basic requirement of human social development. However, there is still a lack of quantitative research on the poverty alleviation effect of regional, characteristic industries. Few studies have focused on the increase of micro individual income and used more advanced policy evaluation tools for comparative analysis based on a quasi-experimental perspective. In addition, the existing research ignores the critical question: can characteristic industries really achieve sustainable development goals while bringing poverty alleviation results? We studied regional, characteristic industries from a new perspective, taking into account the poverty alleviation effect and regional sustainable development. Based on the survey data of 901 households of representative village committees of Tanglang and Dache in Luquan Yi and Miao Autonomous County, this study quantitatively analyzed the poverty alleviation effect of the sorghum planting industry by using the Propensity Score Matching Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) model. The adoption of the industrial alleviation policy has significantly increased the per capita net income of rural households in Tanglang and Dache village committees, by 2171.64 CNY and 1945.06 CNY, respectively. The estimation results of the whole sample show that the effect of the policy to the per capita net income of households is 1726.87 CNY. The development of the sorghum planting poverty alleviation industry in Luquan County has promoted income increase of households significantly, creating economic, social and ecological sustainability, and can provide a reference for less-favoured areas.

TI China's poverty reduction miracle and relative poverty: Focusing on the
   roles of growth and inequality
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Miracle reductions in absolute poverty led China to announce, in late 2019, the strategic change from targeting absolute poverty to targeting relative poverty. After highlighting China's success in the fight against absolute poverty, this paper attempts to assess the roles of growth and income inequality in affecting both absolute and relative poverty rates. Poverty decomposition and panelVAR modelling results show that growth played an overwhelming role in achieving the miracle of poverty reduction but relative poverty has been consistently rising. And growth, contrary to the case of absolute poverty, actually has contributed to the rising trend of relative poverty. Conversely, income inequality has played a small role in aggravating absolute poverty but a moderate role in raising relative poverty. Therefore, it seems appropriate for China to continue targeting absolute poverty with a higher poverty line. In the case that China insists on shifting the poverty alleviation strategy, market-led growth can no longer be relied on to reduce relative poverty. Instead, government-led pro-poor policies must be instituted by providing employment, education, training and other opportunities to the disadvantaged groups, in addition to the usual social assistance.

As one of the most prominent poverty-stricken countries in the world, China has been innovating the way of land use to alleviate poverty. Under the background of land system innovation, land consolidation is an instrument to alleviate poverty. This study first analyzed the mechanism and path behind land consolidation boosting poverty alleviation, then systematically reviewed the evolution of China's land policies related to poverty alleviation since 1978, and finally explained the successful practice of land consolidation boosting poverty alleviation through a typical case study. Results show that land consolidation has multi-functional characteristics. Land consolidation has played an active role in increasing cultivated land area, promoting agricultural production scale, improving rural production conditions and living environment, alleviating ecological risk and supporting for rural development. It also helps to create employment opportunities, promote the capitalization of land resources, widen the way for farmers to increase their income, solve the predicament of lack of land, technology and funds faced by the development of poor areas and revitalize rural economy, thus contributing to rural development and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, third-party assessment of the whole process of socio-economic and ecological impacts of land consolidation is still needed. Decision making of land consolidation needs to take full account of different stakeholders' interests and bottom-up participation is also necessary. These findings will provide beneficial reference for making-decision for sustainable land use and effective poverty alleviation in other developing countries.

TI Child poverty in cross-national perspective: Lessons from the Luxembourg
   Income Study
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB This paper draws on the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) microdata to paint a portrait of child poverty across a diverse group of countries, as of 2004-2006. We will first synthesize past LIS-based research on child poverty, focusing on studies that aim to explain cross-national variation in child poverty rates. Our empirical sections will focus on child poverty in 20 high- and middle-income countries including three Latin American countries, newly added to LIS.
   We will assess poverty among all households and among those with children, and using multiple poverty measures (relative and absolute, pre- and post-taxes and transfers). We will assess the effects of crucial micro-level factors - family structure, educational attainment, and labor market attachment - considering how the effects of these factors vary across counties. Finally, we will analyze the extent to which cross-national variation in child poverty is explained by families' characteristics and/or by the effects of (or returns to) those characteristics. Those returns encompass both market and state-generated income. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the critical period of optimizing economic structure, transforming mode of economic development and growing economic development about endogenous dynamics, deep analysis of Xi Jinping's quality thought, which guides structural reform for supply side, deepens social perception of the concept of which quality makes the country strong and promotes the development of Chinese quality and realizes the road of the "two hundred years" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation, has highly practical significance. By establishing a two-dimensional framework of tool-value chain, this paper quantitatively analyzes Xi Jinping's narratives about quality problems by using content analysis method. It is concluded that Xi Jinping focuses on the application of environmental and demand-oriented policy tools during implementation of the strategy of "quality is strong". The quality of poverty alleviation and the quality of policy quality are outstanding. The scientific and systematic planning and summary of issues, such as poverty alleviation, economic development and construction of quality laws and regulations within the party, are emphasized. It emphasizes the promotion of high-quality economic development, steadfastly promoting poverty alleviation and tackling key problems and advocates taking spiritual poverty alleviation, endogenous poverty alleviation and scientific poverty alleviation as the main contents. That provides strongly theoretical basis and policy compliance for achieving the goal of strengthening the country with quality.

AB This paper aims to find the importance and contribution of spiritual poverty alleviation using people's subjective evaluation data of deeply impoverished areas. The research is conducted according to the method of five-level scale evaluation and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, combined with on-site questionnaires with the masses, and interviews with village cadres. The main findings reveal that the spiritual measures are more important than the material measures, and some of the second-level indicators have relatively low recognition of poverty alleviation contribution, which is an important basis for our targeted policies.

AB Mandated work requirements contained in recent welfare legislation suggest the need to evaluate the extent to which parental work-or the lack of it-contributes to the high poverty rates of American children. Data on 41,996 children under age 18 from the 1990 Current Population Survey support three general conclusions. First, parental employment and children's poverty are inextricably linked in married-couple and female-headed families. Second, simulations reveal that child poverty rates are nevertheless relatively insensitive to increases in parental employment. Only very large and unrealistic increases in maternal employment would significantly reduce child poverty rates. Third, the large black-white differences in child poverty are not simply a result of racial differences in paternal and maternal employment. The problem is not one of finding a job, but rather a job that pays well enough to lift the family (and its children) out of poverty.

Firstly, this study classified and commented on the current situation of research from the aspects of anti-poverty, performance appraisal index and method, index and method of poverty alleviation performance appraisal. And on this basis, the relevant concepts of this study are defined. The data of the first stage of survey is to describe the corresponding conclusions. SPSS 21.0 statistical software establishes the factor analysis model to extract the main factor of the original data and then calculate the weights by factor load and variance contribution rate and measures the precision poverty alleviation performance score of each typical impoverished village. In order to compensate for the single factor analysis model angle and explore whether there is a club effect between the typical impoverished villages, this study also introduces clustering algorithm for the precision poverty alleviation performance of 10 typical poor villages and obtains empirical results. Based on the field survey and empirical results, this study proposes the improvement of poverty alleviation performance, from the improvement of rural poverty management ability, the formulation of targeted pro-poor policies and the formation of diversified poverty network management system three aspects to improve the precision of poverty alleviation.

TI Microfinancial inclusion nexus poverty alleviation: the case of Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Purpose This research examines the long-run relationship between microfinancial inclusion and poverty alleviation in Nigeria from 1990 to 2018. Design/methodology/approach the Engle-Granger two-step co-integration and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) techniques. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita proxies poverty reduction. Number of microfinance banks, borrowers of microfinance institutions, commercial bank branches, commercial bank loan to small-scale businesses and broad money supply ratio measure microfinancial inclusion. Findings The results indicate a long-run relationship between microfinancial inclusion and poverty reduction. The error correction model reveals that microfinancial inclusion and poverty alleviation converge to long-run equilibrium. The number of microfinance banks, lagged value of borrowed funds and broad money supply negatively influences poverty while the lagged values of number of microfinance banks and broad money supply positively influence poverty. Research limitations/implications Effective ways to improve microcredit channels and liquidity flow to the poor through a microfinance bank's intermediation should be promoted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) using an aggressive policy, which provides access to credit to the poor. Practical implications Theoretically, microfinance institutions should increase credit to the poor, especially in rural areas at moderate cost. This study further suggests that many microfinance bank branches should be located in urban and rural areas targeting the poor. Social implications Microfinancial inclusion reduces population's poverty in Nigeria and globally. Originality/value Contrary to other studies, this paper utilizes number of microfinance institutions and borrowers of microfinance institutions to examine the relationship between microfinancial inclusion and poverty alleviation in Nigeria.

TI Poverty Reduction through Growth, Redistribution and Social Inclusion in
   Times of COVID-19: Kenyan Evidence on the Underlying Mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB The paper looks at the nexus between growth, poverty, inequality and redistribution in Africa, using Kenya as a case study. The existing literature shows a strong causal link from growth to poverty reduction. This link is the basis for the pro-poor poverty reduction strategy. There is evidence from the AERC studies that, poverty reduction in a given period is associated with higher growth rates in successive periods that are inequality-reducing and conceptually long lasting. This virtuous spiral of poverty reduction, higher growth and less inequality over time, is the basis for the pro-growth poverty reduction strategy that has recently been emphasized in the literature (Thorbecke and Ouyang, 2022). The two poverty reduction strategies, a pro-poor strategy and a pro-growth poverty reduction one, complement each other, sustaining household escapes from poverty over time. The paper provides evidence from Kenya showing that human capital formation is the key mechanism underlying the virtuous spiral of lower poverty, higher growth and less inequality as the economy progresses through time. A perspective on robustness of the virtuous spiral in the context of COVID-19 and other pandemics is offered in the concluding section of the paper.

TI Everyone's own poverty: Gendering poverty alleviation policies in Turkey
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB The last general election campaign in 2011 was the first in Turkish history to focus on transferring cash to women. This is a strong indication of the feminized face of poverty in Turkey, but also a sign that women are seen as instrumental agents in poverty alleviation. Although until now there has been no systematic policy directed solely to women fighting against poverty, there are patchy micro-credit approaches that target women and households. This article examines gendered aspect of poverty and poverty alleviation policies in Turkey. It argues that the changing nature of poverty has forced the re-alignment of policies to take women into consideration as the main agents of poverty alleviation. Based on the findings of a field survey conducted in the cities of Mugla and Mardin, the study also sheds light on the nature of women's self-expressed needs for poverty alleviation, and shows that addressing female poverty is a multi-faced and multi-dimensional task that should include both holistic and particularistic approaches to poverty alleviation. In the study, 204 women from Mugla (western part of Turkey) and 204 women from Mardin (eastern part of Turkey), where different ethnicities live, were asked what government action was needed to increase their household welfare. The results show that the government action needed to increase household welfare changes according to the geographical location of women and ethnic differences, and this is not necessarily in accordance with the past and current poverty alleviation policies.

SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB Literature abounds on the impact of entrepreneurship on economic growth, but with little attention to the role of entrepreneurship in poverty reduction. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the triangular relationship among poverty reduction, entrepreneurship, and growth in Africa. In this study, we examine the dynamic relationship among these three variables using data collected from 18 African countries. Data are sourced from World Bank development indicators and the World Bank's entrepreneurship database. The study uses batteries of panel data estimation techniques to analyze the data. The following findings emerged: (1) there is bidirectional causality between poverty reduction and growth. (2) There is bidirectional causality between growth and entrepreneurship in Africa. (3) There is unidirectional causality moving from entrepreneurship to poverty reduction. (4) Entrepreneurship significantly reduces poverty in Africa. (5) Impulse response shows that all the variables positively respond to shocks in each other. The study concludes that entrepreneurship enhances poverty reduction in Africa and has a significant impact on economic growth.

TI Impacts of Eco-Poverty Alleviation Policies on Farmer Livelihood Changes
   and Response Mechanisms in a Karst Area of China from a Sustainable
   Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Eco-poverty alleviation policies have significant impacts on the changes in farmer household livelihoods. This study developed a multi-dimensional index system, which applies the social cognitive theory and farmer household livelihood capital to analyze the effects of eco-poverty alleviation policies on farmer household livelihood change in a karst area in China. The multivariate logistic, entropy weight, and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution models were used to analyze the responses of 892 farmer households from eight villages in Guizhou Province, China. The results show that the Poverty Alleviation Resettlement Project (PARP) had the highest impact as it enables higher engagement of farmer households in non-agricultural activities, resulting in significant livelihood changes. Among the eco-poverty alleviation policies studied, changes in livelihoods of farmer households are highest from PARP, followed by the Ecological Forest Ranger Project (EFRP), Grain for Green Program (GGP), Forest Ecosystem Compensation Program (FECP), and Single Carbon Sink Program (SCSP). Specifically, GGP received the highest response from farmer households working out-of-province, whereas SCSP received the lowest. EFRP received the highest response from farmer households working in the village. Farmer households in different regions were found to respond differently to various eco-poverty alleviation policies, based on how specific policies can address their practical problems. It is also related to the delayed effects of these policies on their livelihoods. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing livelihood improvements for farmers at the regional level, which can aid in formulating strategies in the future to alleviate poverty and revitalize local rural communities.

TI Poverty reduction without economic growth? Explaining Brazil's poverty
   dynamics, 1985-2004
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Brazil's slow pace of poverty reduction between the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s reflects both low growth and a low growth elasticity of poverty reduction. Using GDP data disaggregated by state and sector for a twenty-year period, this paper finds considerable variation in the poverty-reducing effectiveness of growth across sectors, across space, and over time. Growth in the services sector was substantially more poverty-reducing than was growth in either agriculture or industry. Growth in industry had different effects on poverty across different states and its impact varied with initial conditions related to human development and worker empowerment. But because there was so little of it, economic growth actually played a relatively small role in accounting for Brazil's poverty reduction between 1985 and 2004. The taming of hyperinflation (in 1994) and a substantial expansion in social security and social assistance transfers, in large part mandated by the 1988 Constitution, accounted for the bulk of the overall reduction in poverty.

TI The Role of BISP's Unconditional Cash Transfers in Alleviating Extreme
   Poverty in Pakistan: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis for the Period
   2011-2019
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB The current study analyzes the impacts of BISP's unconditional cash transfers on beneficiary households' well-being through various indicators including consumption and poverty. The analysis is conducted by using the 2019 cross-sectional data and panel data of 5 rounds conducted during the 2011-2019 period. A Quasi-experimental approach is adopted by applying both the regression discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-discontinuity techniques for cross-sectional and longitudinal data, respectively. The findings reveal that despite 8-years of the intervention, three-fourths of the beneficiary households are still below the poverty line and little impact is found on the consumption expenditures in general. Overall the unconditional cash transfers remained unsuccessful in eradicating extreme poverty which was one of the major objectives of the program. The analysis suggests that BISP needs to revisit its existing design, shifting towards conditional interventions for sustainably alleviating poverty.

TI Childhood Poverty and Its Effect on Health and Well-being: Enhancing
   Training for Learners Across the Medical Education Continuum
SO ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE: Childhood poverty is unacceptably common in the US and threatens the health, development, and lifelong well-being of millions of children. Health care providers should be prepared through medical curricula to directly address the health harms of poverty. In this article, authors from The Child Poverty Education Subcommittee (CPES) of the Academic Pediatric Association Task Force on Child Poverty describe the development of the first such child poverty curriculum for teachers and learners across the medical education continuum.
   METHODS: Educators, physicians, trainees, and public health professionals from 25 institutions across the United States and Canada were convened over a 2-year period and addressed 3 goals: 1) define the core competencies of child poverty education, 2) delineate the scope and aims of a child poverty curriculum, and 3) create a child poverty curriculum ready to implement in undergraduate and graduate medical education settings.
   RESULTS: The CPES identified 4 core domains for the curriculum including the epidemiology of child poverty, poverty related social determinants of health, pathophysiology of the health effects of poverty, and leadership and action to reduce and prevent poverty's health effects. Workgroups, focused on each domain, developed learning goals and objectives, built interactive learning modules to meet them, and created evaluation and faculty development materials to supplement the core curriculum. An editorial team with representatives from each workgroup coordinated activities and are preparing the final curriculum for national implementation.
   CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive, standardized child poverty curriculum developed by an international group of educators in pediatrics and experts in the health effects of poverty should prepare medical trainees to address child poverty and improve the health of poor children.

TI A model for pro-poor wealth creation through small-plot irrigation and
   market linkages
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB This paper relates the field experience of an international NGO in strengthening linkages between irrigation development and poverty reduction. Poverty Reduction through Irrigation and Smallholder Markets (PRISM) is introduced as a methodology for combining small-plot irrigation technology with complementary inputs and services to enhance small farmers' ability to participate effectively in markets for high-value agricultural commodities. Data from field projects in Nepal and India indicate that the PRISM approach can lead to significant additional income for small farmers and other micro and small enterprises in agricultural value chains.

TI The politics of poverty reduction
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB The article analyses the political landscape in which poverty reduction takes place. Much of the discussion on poverty is located within a model of harmony, as if everybody were in favour of pro-poor policies. Such a model covers up the controversial realities which policy-makers and bureaucrats have to face when they design and implement poverty reducing policies. Since many non-poor actors have a stake in how resources in a society are distributed, a model of conflict seems mon realistic. The article takes as its starting point the statement from the UN Social Summit that "At the Summit there was a global commitment to eradicate poverty" and discusses some of its political implications.

TI KNOWLEDGE CHANGES FATE: CAN FINANCIAL LITERACY ADVANCE POVERTY REDUCTION
   IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS?
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Poverty reduction and inclusive growth in poor rural areas attracted the increasing attention of governments and scholars around the world. We investigate financial literacy by conceptualizing its impacts on rural households' poverty reduction, considering current and long-term economic income dynamics. Using a database from 2015 to 2017 China Household Finance Survey, we find that financial literacy has current and long-term effects on promoting rural households' status by eliminating and effectively improving poverty (dynamic effects). Second, this study reveals that financial literacy and education have a significant complementary effect on rural households' poverty reduction. The study distinguishes financial literacy from knowledge obtained through general education. Third, financial education is shown to significantly improve rural households' financial literacy on and enhance poverty reduction. The policy implications of our findings include that the governments and financial institutions are also required to rigorously measure, understand and improve financial literacy. Reform of financial regulatory systems must include a national strategy for education projects and improvement in the quality and supervision of financial products and services.

TI Contemporary Vision of Poverty and Islamic Strategy for Poverty
   Alleviation
SO SAGE OPEN
AB Currently, irrespective of one's religious, ideological, and political inclination, poverty is seen as a destructive force in all aspects. Subsequently, various strategies have been formulated to alleviate poverty. But what are actually the components of the destructive force of poverty in the vision of contemporary Muslim scholars? What kind of Islamic strategies have they formulated out of this vision? This article seeks to answer these two main questions by first investigating into the contemporary vision of poverty that has been adopted by Muslim scholars, followed second by an investigation into the strategies for poverty alleviation they proposed, and third, by critically analyzing their vision of poverty and strategies from an Islamic perspective. Based on a textual analysis of references, this article displays an inadequacy of the vision and strategies of the contemporary Muslim scholars for ignoring material-spiritual definition of poverty, as well as for formulating strategies for poverty alleviation using an exogenous, top-down approach. In a nutshell, this article attempts to provide a justification for rescrutinization of the vision of poverty from an Islamic perspective, and for a reconstruction of the poverty alleviation strategies based on the faith of the Muslim communities themselves.

TI Measuring Child Poverty in South Africa: Sensitivity to the Choice of
   Equivalence Scale and an Updated Profile
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper offers evidence on the sensitivity of child poverty in South Africa to changes in the adult equivalence scale (AES) and updates the child poverty profile based on the Income and Expenditure Survey 2005/06. Setting the poverty line at the 40th percentile of households calculated with different AESs the scope and composition of child poverty are found to be relatively insensitive to the scale used. The rankings of children of different ages, girls versus boys, racial groupings and children living in rural versus urban areas are unaffected by choice of AES, although some provincial rankings on the poverty headcount measure are. The proportions of children and households 'correctly' identified as poor for the full range of scales is extremely high. These findings support the argument that it may be appropriate for profiling poverty in South Africa to use a poverty line based on a per capita welfare measure. For the construction of the child poverty profile, per capita income is used as the welfare indicator with the poverty line set at the 40th percentile of household. The profile suggests that poverty amongst children is more extensive than amongst the population or adults even after the massive injection of transfers into households with poor children through the child support grant. The child poverty headcount, depth and severity are all highest amongst children age 0-4 and lowest amongst those aged 15-17, who are not yet beneficiaries of the grants. They are also highest amongst African and Coloured children. Large variations across provinces remain. The analysis underlines the importance of prioritising children in the fight against poverty, particularly in their earliest years.

TI Growth and Development Finance Required for Achieving Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB We estimate the additional investment required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on SDG 1 on ending extreme poverty by 2030 as well as alternative scenarios of reducing poverty. Ending poverty will be an insurmountable task. Africa requires a double-digit growth rate of 16.6 per cent per year between 2015 and 2030 to end extreme poverty by 2030, which corresponds to an investment-to-GDP ratio and a financing gap to GDP ratio of 87.5 and 65.6 per cent per annum, respectively. However, the estimates on the required growth rates vary widely across sub-regions and levels of development of individual countries. Countries and sub-regions with low initial poverty levels and higher responsiveness of poverty to income will be able to end poverty with lower growth rates and lower development finance. The paper outlines the potential policy implications of our findings.

TI Evaluating anti-poverty policy efficiencies in China: meta-frontier
   analysis using the two-stage data envelopment analysis model
SO CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Purpose This study examines the relative efficiencies of anti-poverty policies implemented in 28 Chinese provinces. Design/methodology/approach This study uses meta-frontier undesirable dynamic two-stage data envelopment analysis. The authors divide the poverty reduction process into two stages: agricultural production and poverty reduction. Public expenditure is the input for the second stage, and the population below the poverty line is the undesirable output. The authors compute the efficiencies (overall efficiency, efficiency of each stage and the efficiencies of individual inputs and outputs) using meta-frontier analysis for the 28 provinces. Findings The results show that: (1) a significant imbalance exists between the eastern and western regions in terms of input-output efficiencies; (2) the poverty reduction stage generally fared better than the agricultural production stage did. In particular, most provinces saw increases in poverty reduction efficiencies between 2013 and 2017; (3) the place-based poverty relief policies introduced in recent years are effective at reducing the poverty rate and reaching the government-set goals and (4) while disposable income has increased steadily over the past few years, income inequality has been exacerbated. Research limitations/implications The results show that: (1) a significant imbalance exists between the eastern and western regions in terms of input-output efficiencies; (2) the poverty reduction stage generally fared better than the agricultural production stage did. In particular, most provinces saw increases in poverty reduction efficiencies between 2013 and 2017; (3) the place-based poverty relief policies introduced in recent years are effective at reducing the poverty rate and reaching the government-set goals and (4) while disposable income has increased steadily over the past few years, income inequality has exacerbated. Originality/value A large amount of attention and public resources are devoted to fighting poverty and associated market failures in China. The extant literature focuses either on the agricultural production itself or the relationship between human capital and productivity levels. Making use of recent developments of the DEA method, the authors propose a new framework for evaluating the efficiencies of the poverty reduction process. Such a framework has the advantage of giving researchers and policymakers a more detailed diagnosis with regard to the components in the endeavor to eliminate poverty and providing useful information for policymakers to optimize public funds use. Methodologically, the framework is flexible enough to be employed for future research in similar appraisals, at different geographic and scale aggregation levels, for public projects including but not limited to poverty reduction.

TI Balance between poverty alleviation and air pollutant reduction in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Key targets of the sustainable development goals might be in contradiction to each other. For example, poverty alleviation may exacerbate air pollution by increasing production and associated emissions. This paper investigates the potential impacts of achieving different poverty eradication goals on typical air pollutants in China by capturing household consumption patterns for different income groups and locations, and linking it to China's multi-regional input-output table and various scenarios. We find that ending extreme poverty, i.e. lifting people above the poverty line of USD 1.90 a day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP), increases China's household emissions by only less than 0.6%. The contribution increases to 2.4%-4.4% when adopting the USD 3.20 PPP poverty line for lower-middle-income countries. Technical improvements in economic sectors can easily offset poverty-alleviation-induced emissions in both scenarios. Nevertheless, when moving all impoverished residents below the USD 5.50 PPP poverty line for upper-middle-income countries, household emissions in China would increase significantly by 18.5%-22.3%. Counteracting these additional emissions would require national emission intensity in production to decrease by 23.7% for SO2, 13.6% for NO (x) , 82.1% for PM2.5, and 58.0% for PM10. Required synergies between poverty alleviation and emission reduction call for changes in household lifestyles and production.

TI The Impact of Education Investment on Regional Poverty Alleviation,
   Dynamic Constraints, and Marginal Benefits: A Case Study of Yunnan's

SO ECONOMIES
AB This paper studied the impact of education investment on regional poverty alleviation of Yunnan's poor counties, especially the dynamic constraints and marginal benefits of education input. This paper takes 30 poor counties in Yunnan province from 2007 to 2020 as the research object. A double fixed effect model, a systematic GMM model, and a quantile regression model are used to study the effect of education investment on regional poverty alleviation from static and dynamic levels. The results show that education investment has a significant positive effect on regional poverty alleviation at both static and dynamic levels. At the same time, under different poverty levels, the effect of education investment on poverty alleviation shows a law of diminishing marginal effect. As for the current situation of poor counties in Yunnan Province, the effect of education investment on poverty alleviation is increasing at a decreasing rate. The research object of this paper has achieved the goal of getting rid of absolute poverty, so the conclusion of this paper has more reference value.

It breaks the balance of economic development, resources sustained and environmental protection for the cause of the population out of control, the natural mines over-depletion and land degeneration. In this paper, a new strategy is introduced into the rural poverty alleviation of the NPMCs, which sets up a model to coordinate the policies and approaches of poverty reduction into harmonization to drive the rural China's poverty eradication by stressing the sustainable county-regional economic development and social advance in multilateral ways of the investments of human capitals, physical capitals and environmental capitals, since the traditional policies on poverty reduction is in less efficiency in the new era. The paper is discussed in six sections, which, the instruction that the contributions reviewed in the previous research and current issues talked in the rural China's poverty reduction in section one, interactions between the poverty and the shortage of physical capitals, human capitals and environmental capitals talked in section two, the poverty reduction trap analyzed in section three, the model of the new strategy introduced in section four, the approaches discussed in section five, and in section six is the conclusion.

TI How does low-carbon energy transition alleviate energy poverty in China?
   A nonparametric panel causality analysis
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Low-carbon energy transition is conducive to saving energy and reducing emissions, and its impact on energy poverty warrants intensive attention. By employing a balanced panel dataset of China's 30 provinces for the period 2004-2017, we examine the causal relationship between low-carbon energy transition and energy poverty by using a novel nonparametric panel causality-in-quantiles (PCIQ) method. Also, the internal impact mechanism between low-carbon energy transition and energy poverty is analyzed. The primary findings of our study imply that low-carbon energy transition shows significant bidirectional causality with energy poverty alleviation. And the low-carbon energy transition can stimulate energy poverty alleviation by affecting poverty in the availability of energy services, the cleanness of energy consumption, the integrity of energy management, and energy affordability and efficiency. Our findings provide an important reference for the government to formulate relevant policies that promote the alleviation of energy poverty.

TI Spatial variation in poverty-generating processes: Child poverty in the
   United States
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB This study builds on research demonstrating that sub-regions within the United States have different processes that abet poverty and that child poverty is spatially differentiated. We focus on the social attributes of the local area to assess what the geographic place represents in terms of social characteristics, namely racial/ethnic composition and economic structure, and to resolve apparent inconsistencies in poverty research. Using spatial regime and spatial error regression techniques to analyze county census data, we examine spatial differentiation in the relationships that generate child poverty. Our approach addresses the conceptual and technical aspects of spatial inequality. Results show that local-area processes are at play with implications for more nuanced theoretical models and anti-poverty policies that consider systematic differences in factors contributing to child poverty according to the racial/ethnic and economic contexts.

SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper describes and reviews the process of constructing a Multidimensional Child Poverty Measure in three sub-Saharan Africa countries: Mali, Malawi, and Tanzania. These countries recently (in 2015 and 2014) constructed a measure of multidimensional child poverty using UNICEF's Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA) methodology and conducted a comprehensive child poverty study including both deprivation and monetary poverty. This work describes how the methodology was adapted in the different contexts, discussing critical issues that arose during the study process, and compares the results of the three studies. The goal is to offer an overview of the different national processes and determine how similar or different factors influence the results.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the contribution of financial development to poverty reduction in 11 South Asian developing countries using panel data set over the time period 1990-2012.
   Design/methodology/approach - The stationarity properties are checked by using Levin-Lin-Chu and Im-Pesaran-Shin panel unit root tests. The paper applied the Pedroni's panel co-integration test to examine the existence of long-run relationship. The coefficients of co-integration are examined by fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and the causal link is checked by panel causality test.
   Findings - The empirical results of Pedroni co-integration test confirm a long-run relationship between financial development and poverty reduction in South Asian developing economies. The findings of FMOLS method confirm a strong and positive relationship between financial development, trade openness, inflation and poverty reduction. Results of panel causality test indicate that there is a unidirectional causality running from financial development to poverty reduction variable.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study recommends appropriate economic and financial reforms focussing on financial inclusion to reduce poverty in selected South Asian economies.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind to empirically examine the causal relationship between financial sector development and poverty reduction in South Asian economies using modern econometric techniques.

TI Does targeted poverty alleviation disclosure improve stock performance?
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB The involvement of enterprises in targeted poverty alleviation is a unique aspect of corporate social responsibility in China. Using an event-study methodology, this paper investigates the effect of the disclosure of targeted poverty alleviation information on the stock performance of Chinese listed companies. Our findings indicate that the disclosure boosts stock returns in a short time, and that the stock prices of private enterprises react more strongly to the disclosure than those of state-owned enterprises.

The programme's rationale can be characterised as incentive-based participation, using both local employment and shared risks concepts. The programme so far has been a relative success. However, in the light of poverty alleviation questions have to be raised about the isolated nature of the programme as well as the role of the incentives used.

TI Using cultural heritage sites in Mexico to understand the poverty
   alleviation impacts of protected areas
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB Win-win outcomes between biodiversity conservation and local economic development are now a goal of many governments and conservation organizations but can be difficult to achieve. Where they occur, reductions in poverty from protected areas are often thought to be driven by economic gains from tourism that are sufficient to outweigh losses due to restrictions on land-use or resource extraction. However, evidence about this channel is scarce. In this paper, we explore the potential compensatory effect of tourism by comparing poverty alleviation outcomes for cultural heritage sites in Mexico across two decades from 1990 to 2010. These sites are similar to protected areas in terms of attracting tourists, but they do not impose substantial restrictions on local land or resource use, allowing us to isolate tourism as a possible channel for economic development. Overall, we find mixed evidence that proximity to cultural heritage sites is associated with poverty reduction. During the first study period (1990-2000), localities close to cultural heritage sites saw reduced poverty of 0.034 standard deviations for each additional site. However, during the second period (2000-2010), localities close to heritage sites saw less poverty reduction than the comparison group (-0.014 standard deviations for each additional site). In both periods, poverty alleviation effects were not consistently correlated with the total number of visitors, but were larger further from cities, where baseline poverty was higher, and in the Yucatan Peninsula. This heterogeneity indicates that variability in the ability of local communities to capture benefits from tourism depends on a particular combination of institutional and geographic factors-as was the case in the Yucatan peninsula, where cultural heritage sites had consistent poverty alleviation effects over two decades.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) Poverty Alleviation makes full use of the solar energy in poverty-stricken areas so as to achieve sTable incomes increase for the poor households for 25 years. It is an advanced mode integrating new energy development, emission reduction and accurate poverty alleviation. Post evaluation of PV poverty alleviation project is of great guiding significance for new energy development planning, poverty alleviation promoting and construction and operation of PV power stations. Under the guidance of the practical experience of PV poverty alleviation in Jiangxi province, China, this paper firstly builds a comprehensive evaluation index system with 7 second-level targets based on the post evaluation theory. Then, considering that projects with different sizes, construction and operation mode have different features in the evaluation, this paper uses pattern recognition method based on fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and support vector machine to classify the projects. Then comparative analysis is carried out within each class to achieve comprehensive benefits evaluation. The method can reduce the information loss of multi-index weighted aggregation of traditional post evaluation methods. The features of PV poverty alleviation projects are highlighted to help to find the weak points of the projects. So the evaluation results are more scientific and reasonable.

SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB Child poverty is widespread and anticipated to endure in the future, particularly in developing countries. By 2030, it is predicted that a considerable number of children would be living in poverty. As a result, addressing child poverty is a top priority for researchers and politicians today. The objective of this study is to examine and measure the factors that contribute to child poverty in the Negele Arsi woreda, West Arsi Zone, Oromia Regional State. Based on probability proportionate to size, multistage sampling procedures were employed to pick 401 respondents from four kebeles. The data for this study was gathered using enumerator-administered interview schedules. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics techniques, and the causes of child poverty were analyzed using a probit regression model. The multidimensional poverty assessment method was utilized to assess child poverty based on several indicators. As a result, the total multidimensional child poverty analysis found that around 80 percent of children in the study area were multidimensionally poor. Multidimensional poverty was found to be highly affected by factors such as household socioeconomic status, the age of the household head, and household wealth status. Similarly, nutrition, education, information, shelter, income, and fuel are all intimately tied to children's requirements.

TI Interrogating sub-Saharan Africa's high economic growth rate and low
   poverty reduction rate: A poverty paradox?
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
AB Sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) high economic growth coincides with an increase in the level of poverty. In a panel of 40 SSA countries over a 30-year period, while accounting for the potential spillover effect of poverty in the region. The study found that economic growth recorded over the years has not translated to poverty reduction, particularly, in resource-rich economies of SSA. The result also shows that income inequality worsens the effect of economic growth on poverty and that the poverty-reducing effectiveness of growth varies considerably across sectors, across space, and over time. The research findings suggest that governments across the region, particularly, in oil-exporting countries in SSA must diversify the economy away from oil (toward the service sector) to reduce poverty in the region.

TI The effect of financial inclusion on poverty reduction in Sub-Sahara

SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This paper investigated the threshold effect of financial inclusion on poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using an annual dataset spanning 2010 to 2017, the Hansen's estimation and Differenced generalized method of moments (GMM) methods were used to estimate the threshold level of financial inclusion that will reduce poverty and factors that influence financial inclusion respectively. The results showed that beyond a threshold level of 0.365, financial inclusion would lead to poverty reduction with money supply being positively significant towards poverty reduction in SSA. The results further indicated that domestic credit to the private sector positively affects financial inclusion. Development partners and governments in the sub-region should therefore implement policies that are aimed at providing an enabling environment for financial institutions to provide financial services that are readily available and affordable to the public in order to benefit from the desired poverty reduction effect of financial inclusion.

TI A Study on the Efficiency of Tourism Poverty Alleviation in Ethnic
   Regions Based on the Staged DEA Model
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Poverty alleviation through tourism is an important way for China to achieve targeted poverty alleviation and win the battle of poverty alleviation. As a region with deep poverty and great difficulty in poverty alleviation, whether tourism development has injected key impetus into ethnic minority areas needs to be tested by both qualitative analysis and quantitative measurement. This paper takes eight ethnic provinces (regions) in China as an example to conduct an empirical study. Based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-BCC model and Malmquist index, it evaluates the tourism investment and tourism poverty alleviation efficiency of the ethnic regions in the two stages of tourism poverty alleviation, and analyzes them by classification. The results of the study show: (1) The pure technical efficiency in the first stage is relatively high, but the total factor productivity of each region is declining; (2) The pure technical efficiency in the second stage is also relatively high, but the scale efficiency is low, and the change rate of total factor productivity of the provinces in China has increased significantly; (3) The "double high" type includes Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, and the "double low" type includes Qinghai, Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Ningxia. The results of the study generally show that tourism poverty alleviation has brought about the improvement of the living standards of residents and the development of local economy, but the efficiency of tourism poverty alleviation needs to be improved. On this basis, the article puts forward corresponding improvement measures, in order to further help the ethnic minority areas get rid of poverty in a comprehensive way by promoting the efficient and sustainable development of tourism.

AB This article discusses the ways in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) mobilizes local governments to implement policies set by higher-level governments. Using the concept of 'institutionalized mobilization', we discuss poverty alleviation in H county. We identify three key mechanisms: the cross-system leading group, cross-level personnel/financial management, and pairing-up. These mechanisms involve both the adjustment of tiao tiao ((sic)(sic)) and kuai kuai () relationships within the bureaucracy and the strengthening of state-society relations. We also point out the many problems resulting from this mode of institutionalized mobilization. Finally, we compare the political and geographical conditions in H county with those in two other counties - E and K - to ascertain whether the results of poverty alleviation are sustainable.

AB Understanding the hotspots and patterns of tourism poverty alleviation is of great significance to stakeholders. This study aims to comprehensively and scientifically understand the research hotspots, characteristics, trends, and future research directions in the field of tourism poverty alleviation, provide decision support for tourism stakeholders, improve the level of management and service quality of tourism, balance the distribution of tourism resources and interests, and promote high-quality and sustainable development of tourism. First, we propose a dynamic nonnegative matrix factorization (DNMF) method to analyze the tourism poverty alleviation literature from 2012 to 2021, extract hot topics and topic words. Then, we propose a topic evaluation criteria to evaluate the effect of the extracted topics. Third, we propose a topic intensity model to calculate the intensity of hot topics that can track the evolution trend of hot topics in the past 10 years, and explore the future development trends of the tourism poverty alleviation. Finally, we put forward the countermeasures and suggestions for sustainable tourism poverty alleviation under the guidance of sustainable development theory. The experimental results show that DNMF has a good effect in topic extraction. The evolution process based on topic intensity reflects the evolution trend of China's tourism poverty alleviation. This study provides a theoretical foundations and technical support for the sustainable development of China's tourism poverty alleviation.

TI Urbanization patterns and poverty reduction: A new perspective to
   explore the countries along the Belt and Road
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Urbanization and poverty reduction are two vital aspects for global sustainable and healthy development. In the future, the countries along the Belt and Road will play a more important role in global urbanization and poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper aims at elaborating the characteristics and patterns of urbanization and poverty reduction in these countries using data from 1996 to 2016. The results indicate that the average urbanization level is 48% in 2016 and the average annual growth rate of these countries is 0.61 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. In addition, West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have a higher level of urbanization, while ultra-high-speed and high-speed development countries are primarily Southeast Asian countries and China. Furthermore, these countries differentiate significantly in terms of spatial distribution of population density. Regions with a population density of 0-1 person per square kilometer account for 33% of the total area and 0.09% of the total population, while regions with a population density of over 1000 people per square kilometer account for 1.45% of the total area and 39.56% of the total population. Moreover, using mathematical morphology methods, we identify the 10 regions with the largest urban land areas among these countries, and seven regions are located in China and Southeast Asia. Finally, the population living in extreme poverty in these countries dropped from 1.17 billion to 355.6 million during the 20-year period, and several countries, such as China, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, have made tremendous progress both in urbanization and poverty reduction. These findings are beneficial for comprehending urban development and poverty reduction in the countries along the Belt and Road as well as for providing references for regional cooperation.

TI Do We Understand the Linkages between Economic Growth, Poverty Targets
   and Poverty Reduction?
SO REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB This article contributes to the debate on poverty trends in Africa, looking at the argument for a correspondence between economic growth and poverty reduction. It questions whether a link between economic growth and poverty reduction can be established. First there is a look at the general picture in Africa and no convincing evidence of this link is found, before the article turns to two countries, Burkina Faso and Madagascar, which on the surface seem to exemplify the link. However, in Burkina Faso the link exists only in a limited way and for only a short period (1998-2003), while in Madagascar, where the link appears more obvious, social and political unrest in 2009 casts doubt on the reliability of the data. Indeed, it is probable that an increase in poverty contributed to the crisis in Madagascar. Furthermore, there are signs that in both countries poverty strategies are increasingly giving way to Poverty Reduction Growth Facility programmes, closely related to former structural adjustment loans. It is concluded, first, that analysing poverty strategies through Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers does not help in resolving the uncertainty, since these strategies assume a priori the existence of a link between economic growth and poverty reduction; second, that collection and interpretation of poverty data could be biased, with the World Bank, for example, having an interest in showing improvements in poverty reduction in Africa; and, finally, that the paucity of data needs, at the very least, to be recognised as a major problem.

The empirical analysis is based on the 2015-2018 longitudinal sample of the Survey of Income and Living Conditions for Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia. Results show strong poverty persistence regardless of poverty measure, with much stronger effects observed for Croatia and Serbia than for Slovenia.

AB This chapter uses a global trade model, supplemented with household survey data, to explore the potential impact of ASEAN trade liberalization on poverty in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our tentative results suggest that ASEAN liberalization is likely to bring substantial gains to the region and lead to significant reductions in poverty. In a simulation of full removal of intra-ASEAN tariffs, we find 320,000 people are moved out of extreme poverty, with a further 1.4 million lifted above the $2 per day poverty line. Poverty reductions are particularly significant in the case of agricultural and rural diversified households and for Cambodia. Under broader ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6 liberalizations, we find a similar pattern of poverty reduction and the overall reduction in poverty is much higher.

TI Child poverty and the reform of family cash benefits
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS
AB Child poverty is a fully recognized problem in the industrialized world. In the EU, nearly one in every five children experienced poverty in 2008 while for the population as a whole, the risk of poverty was around 17%. The scale of this problem and its consequences underpin the importance of identifying and learning about the underlying processes.
   This article aims to study how family cash benefits have impacted on child poverty, over recent years. Based on microdata gathered by the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU_SILC) for the period 2004-2008, we generate a portrait of child income poverty in four countries: Italy, Portugal, Spain and Poland. Moreover, we consider the major legislative changes in family social security payments able to impact on child poverty.
   The international comparison enables an identification of the children's poverty profile and pattern of incidence across the countries analysed while also analysing just how family and child cash benefits have impacted on child poverty. This exercise finally enables an initial test of the efficiency and the effectiveness of these benefits.
   The methodological framework deployed ranges from descriptive methods to econometric models in order to sustain our discussion of the subject under study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The arithmetics and politics of domestic resource mobilization for
   poverty eradication
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB The Addis Ababa Action Agenda stresses the importance of effective resource mobilization and use of domestic resources to pursue sustainable development. The first Sustainable Development Goal is to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This paper explores how feasible it would be for developing countries to achieve the goal of eradicating poverty using only domestic resources, given their current tax base and political equilibrium. To answer this question, we propose two new met-rics: a Poverty Eradication Capacity Index and a Political Influence Concentration Index. The first metric looks at the "arithmetics" of the issue, and uses an accounting approach to assess whether the existing tax base is rich enough to end poverty through monetary redistribution. The second metric looks at the "politics" of the issue, and approximates the degree to which political power is concentrated among the rich-fol-lowing the notion that a high concentration of power would likely hinder the effective implementation of fiscal policies (in terms of both revenue collection and social spending). We calculate these two metrics using data for over 120 developing countries, and find that: (i) a large proportion of countries simply do not have an affluent enough tax base to finance their own poverty eradication through redistribution; (ii) countries with the same arithmetic capacity to mobilize resources for poverty eradication differ widely in terms of the political feasibility of such policies; and (iii) a higher capacity for poverty eradication and a lower concentration of political influence is associated with a higher collection of tax revenue as a share of GDP. These results suggest that countries facing binding arithmetic and/or political constraints may need to complement domestic resources with foreign aid in the short-term. Such financial flows, how-ever, should be designed to support the reduction of these constraints in the long-term. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper conducts an empirical investigation of the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and poverty in selected African economies. Using system generalised method of moments, our findings showed that FDI inflows have significantly contributed to poverty reduction in African countries. Our results also showed that better institutional quality and human capital development are associated with reducing poverty. Furthermore, interacting FDI with financial development was found to significantly reduce poverty, thus providing support to the hypothesis that better functioning financial systems enhance the efficiency of FDI in reducing poverty.

TI Ecosystem services and poverty alleviation: A review of the empirical

SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB We present the results of a review of the empirical evidence and of the state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms linking ecosystem services and poverty alleviation. The review was undertaken to determine the state of current knowledge about the scale and nature of these linkages, and focus the future research agenda. Research has, to date, focussed largely on provisioning services, and on just two poverty dimensions concerning income and assets, and food security and nutrition. While many papers describe links between ecosystem services and dimensions of poverty, few provide sufficient context to enable a thorough understanding of the poverty alleviation impacts (positive or negative), if any. These papers contribute to the accumulating evidence that ecosystem services support well-being, and perhaps prevent people becoming poorer, but provide little evidence of their contribution to poverty alleviation, let alone poverty elimination. A considerable gap remains in understanding the links between ecosystem services and poverty, how change occurs, and how pathways out of poverty may be achieved based on the sustainable utilisation of ecosystem services.

TI Does Tourism Reduce Poverty in Sub-Saharan African Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), precisely the one of eradicating extreme poverty at the end of 2030, it is important to understand factors that can reduce poverty. This article examines the effects of tourism development on poverty in Sub-Saharan African countries. Because of the possibility of an endogeneity problem arising from a reverse causation that might exist between poverty and the explanatory variables, the system Generalized Method of Moments (system GMM) estimation technique was deployed. The findings showed that tourism development contributes to poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. In other words, the results obtained provided ample support for the workability of a pro-poor tourism policy agenda. As a result, policies that are targeted at increasing the attractiveness and awareness of the existing SSA tourism sites in order to increase international tourism receipts and arrivals should be promoted since such interventions have considerable poverty reduction potential.

SO BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC HORIZONS
AB This study investigates impacts of migration through remittances on poverty reduction in Vietnam by using the two most recent Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys in 2014 and 2016. Results of a fixed-effect logit and a fractional logit model show that although both internal remittances and international remittances increase per capita income only internal remittances have positive impacts on poverty incidence and poverty intensity. In addition, by testing impacts of remittances on pushing a household jump above the poverty line and its effects on the depth of poverty, this study has revealed poverty reduction effect of remittances more fully. Based on the findings the study suggests that it is important to acknowledge the benefits of internal migration. For the purpose of poverty alleviation, policies that attract remittances should be given greater attention.

AB Like most other countries in the SADC region, Malawi has swiftly endorsed the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In the water sector, these principles are reflected in the National Water Policy (2004) and in the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (2002) which emphasize three key aspects. First, the articulation of a vision and policy objectives that address development and management of water for productive purposes, conservation and poverty reduction. Second, the recognition of international and regional conventions and agreements on water resources to which Malawi is a signatory, thereby promoting global partnership for development. Third, the provision of mechanisms for monitoring, assessment and development related to watershed management, conservation and the mitigation of floods and droughts. Both the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the National Water Policy seek to reduce poverty by increasing access to water for domestic and productive purposes. In particular, the MPRSP will focus on constructing and rehabilitating water facilities, extend water supply capacity, promote community-based management and improve water resources conservation and management. In this paper, we examine the challenges of implementing these goals against the background of various institutional reforms in the water sector. We argue that although Malawi has come up with very clear strategies and guidelines for promoting MDGs, a combination of human and financial resources, bedevil the successful implementation of these ideas. In addition, the strategies do not articulate water as a medium for poverty alleviation in a holistic manner. The paper further demonstrates ways in which the promotion of IWRM can facilitate in reducing poverty. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ECONOMICS AND FINANCE LETTERS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the global economy, which has rendered many of the world's population impoverished. Moreover, the pandemic has generated some uncertainties regarding economic and social policies. This phenomenon is lately the brunt of every government across the globe. This present study seeks to evaluate the pandemic's impact on poverty alleviation and the global GDP by considering individual countries' heterogeneous effects in a panel study. The motivation is to unravel the social and economic effects on the global economy. However, 170 countries are utilized in this study, and econometric panel techniques such as OLS and robust least square regression methods are utilized. The data was collected from OurWorldindata.com, comprising total COVID-19 cases, total deaths, stringency index, human development index, and gross domestic product per capita. The study's findings stipulate that many people's stringency and the contraction of the disease have inversely affected poverty alleviation and economic growth. Nevertheless, for the deaths recorded so far positively affects both poverty alleviation and economic growth. This development signals the essence of controlling population growth as it impedes economic growth and poverty alleviation. The study recommends that governments invest in health and education improvement and stimulate their economies to create employment that could propagate growth to improve poverty alleviation and economic growth.

TI Rural financial development, spatial spillover, and poverty reduction:
   evidence from China
SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB Rural financial development is deemed essential for eliminating poverty. In China, successive governments have initiated a series of financial development plans to reduce poverty since the launch of economic reform in the late 1970s. However, there is a rising concern about whether financial development can reduce poverty in China. This study uses a panel dataset of 30 provinces (out of 31) in mainland China from 1997 to 2015 to examine the effect of rural financial development on poverty reduction. We employ a spatial panel model to investigate whether rural financial development has a positive spatial spillover effect. Moreover, we use the instrumental variable method to address the possible bidirectional causal effect between rural financial development and poverty reduction. Our study confirms that rural financial development does reduce poverty and simultaneously widen the urban-rural income gap. We further find that rural financial development has a positive spatial spillover effect on poverty alleviation and that the conventional panel model (e.g., fixed effects method) may underestimate the effect of rural financial development, as it ignores the spatial spillover effect.

This study uses the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method to assess the performance of rural e-commerce in poverty alleviation in Sichuan Province. Firstly, an evaluation system of the performance of rural e-commerce in poverty alleviation was constructed, including policy support (A(1)), development model innovation (A(2)), domestic sales of agricultural products (A(3)), and rural e-commerce management (A(4)), with a total of 14 indicators at four levels. Secondly, the evaluation system was tested for consistency in conjunction with expert opinions. Finally, taking Sichuan province as an example, the indicators of the four guiding levels were found to have an impact on the development of rural e-commerce in the order of importance A(3) > A(2) > A(4) > A(1). It is hoped that this study can provide some theoretical guidance for improving the performance level of rural e-commerce poverty alleviation and maintaining the ability of rural e-commerce poverty alleviation to "gain more benefits".

Specifically, the study employed the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration technique and Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to estimate the existing relationship between the variables, using time series data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The findings revealed that poverty alleviation programmes have a significant positive impact on economic development in Nigeria, while unemployment has a significant negative impact on economic development in Nigeria within the period under review. It was also revealed that poverty alleviation programmes granger causes economic development, but economic development does not granger cause poverty alleviation programmes as expected. However, unemployment and economic development granger cause each other as expected. The study, therefore, concludes that any policy aimed at addressing poverty and unemployment, if properly formulated and executed, will promote sustainable economic development in Nigeria.

TI Poverty alleviation and local environmental degradation: An empirical
   analysis in Colombia
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Poverty eradication and global warming are the two biggest challenges of our time. Yet they are also inter-linked. While it has been widely demonstrated that climate change hinders poverty eradication efforts, there is no consensus on the reverse causality, mainly due to methodological limitations of existing research. This study addresses this gap in our understanding of the causal relationship between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation through the analysis of a cash transfer program aimed at poverty reduction. By linking micro and macro data, the study explores the causal link between poverty reduction at the household level and environmental impact at the aggregate local level. The context of the empirical research is the Familias en Accion program in Colombia, a conditional cash transfer program launched by the Colombian government in 2000. Multiple data sets are used for the analysis. The findings show that the receipt of cash transfers at the household level is associated with increases in the purchase of land- and energy-intensive goods. But this, in turn, does not have a negative effect on local environmental conditions in treated municipalities. Deforestation rates are, in fact, lower compared to similar municipalities. This counter intuitive finding is partly explained by the mediating effect of market proximity. The research thus contributes to the literature by providing new and novel evidence on the relationship between poverty reduction and the local environment and by proposing empirical solutions to address existing methodological challenges for research in this area. From a policy perspective, the study demonstrates the significance of local context, advocates for the use of global carbon footprints, and confirms that the environmental footprint of poverty reduction is small.

TI Multidimensional Child Poverty from the Child Rights-Based Approach: A
   Latent Class Analysis to Estimating Child Poverty Groups in Mexico
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB The study aims at estimating multidimensional poverty groups among children under five years of age in Mexico. Our analysis is based upon the framework on the Rights of the Child. For this purpose, we focus on identifying different types of child deprivation and the various risk factors that determine child poverty in Mexico, such as the type of locality, ethnicity and the region of Mexico where children live, among others. The study is based on the theoretical notion that children must realize their specific rights, established in the Mexican legal framework, in order to achieve an adequate standard of living and guarantee the well-being and development of children. For this reason, child development has been included as one of the analytical dimensions of poverty, because this has been often discarded in child poverty studies. We support the idea that any violation of social rights means deprivation. The method applied in this research is a conditional latent class analysis and we use covariates which have helped for better predicting the average probabilities of experiencing deprivations in each latent class. Thus, the main objective of the study is to identify groups of children experiencing extreme, moderate and no poverty. The results show that children under five years in Mexico, belonging to the poorest stratum have represented about twenty percent; however, fifty percent of them have experienced moderate poverty and only thirty percent are non-poor. We conclude that universal and targeted policies should be implemented to eradicate multidimensional child poverty.

TI Pluralism about Global Poverty
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB Theorists have identified a wide range of reasons why individual and collective actors have a moral responsibility to help alleviate global poverty. There is now widespread agreement that several of these reasons are valid. From the perspective of the poverty opponent, it might seem that the more reasons there are to alleviate poverty, the better. The difficulty is that different reasons for alleviating poverty point to different poverty-alleviating activities. This situation generates questions about both how actors should set priorities among different poverty-alleviating activities ('actor-centred' questions) and who should have primary responsibility for alleviating particular cases of poverty ('case-centred' questions). This article explains why actor-centred and case-centred questions are worth asking and sketches a promising way of responding to them.

TI A Sustainable Development Approach to Assessing the Engagement of
   Tourism Enterprises in Poverty Alleviation
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Tourism is a significant or growing economic sector in most countries with high levels of poverty on a global scale. Consequently, previous studies have suggested that tourism enterprises could and should play an active role in reducing poverty. This paper analyses the engagement of tourism enterprises in poverty alleviation. First, different sustainable development approaches are considered as regards increasing the contribution of this stakeholder to poverty alleviation, including corporate social responsibility. Second, empirical studies on the impacts of tourism organizations on poverty published since the year 1999 are critically analysed in order to generate an empirical research framework embracing the following issues: geographical scope, tourism scope and study methods. Third, there is an integrative discussion of empirical evidence from the literature regarding the contribution of private tourism enterprises and other tourism organizations to poverty reduction. Findings suggest that their contribution to poverty alleviation is linked to voluntary social responsibility initiatives and the organization size. Additional findings are shown regarding economic, socio-culturaland environmental impacts. Recommendations for future research and public policy implications are also provided, which could be of interest to other industries. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

TI Ethics, Poverty and Children's Vulnerability
SO ETHICS AND SOCIAL WELFARE
AB This paper is concerned with child poverty from an ethical perspective and applies the normative concept of vulnerability for this purpose. The first part of the paper will briefly outline children's particular vulnerability and distinguish important aspects of this. Then the concept will be applied to child poverty and it will be shown that child poverty is a corrosive situational vulnerability, with many severe consequences. In this part of the paper normative reasoning and empirical literature will be brought together. Then, the next section will establish why this increased vulnerability of poor children and the harm to their well-being and well-becoming, which they suffer for this reason, are of ethical concern. It will be discussed that child poverty is a structural problem based on social, political and economic factors. The concluding section will then briefly outline why it is imperative to protect children from the vulnerabilities associated with poverty.

TI Impacts of solar photovoltaic projects on sustainable livelihoods:
   Evidence from rural China
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects (PPAPs) have flourished with great achievements in China since 2013. However, the degree to which these PPAPs contribute to the sustainable livelihoods and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. By using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling and multi-group comparative analysis, this study has explored the poverty reduction mechanism of China's PPAPs from the perspective of sustainable livelihood of rural low-income families, taking 1112 rural households in China's 9 counties as the research subject. Results demonstrate that PPAPs perform best in promoting rural livelihood diversification. The PV projects actually provide the service of searching out a personal potential and assist in achieving their economic goal. The parallel mediating effects of livelihood assets, endogenous impetus and livelihood strategies between PPAPs and livelihood outcomes are significant. The poor's livelihood resources are catalysts for the performance of interventions. Further, for those families of the non-agricultural type, and for those with high energy saving habits, good education and young age, PPAPs can be more effective in reducing poverty and improving quality of life and overall income; while the influence of PPAPs on livelihood capital and thought impetus is relatively more significant for those families with greater PV knowledge and project cogni-tion, reflecting the poverty reduction pathways of PPAPs show heterogeneity.

TI Performance evaluation of China?s photovoltaic poverty alleviation
   project using machine learning and satellite images
SO UTILITIES POLICY
AB Photovoltaic poverty alleviation project (PPAP) is one of China's essential targeted poverty alleviation projects. This study proposes a machine learning model and uses satellite images to evaluate the performance of PPAP in China. The trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with transfer learning was first used to identify the scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations. Then the PV power capacity for poverty alleviation and carbon emission mitigation were estimated. The results identified 38 large-scale centralized and approximately 5,063,293 m2PV power stations built in Jinzhai County, Anhui province, China, by November 2020. The main findings are as follows. (1) The power generation and carbon mitigation of PPAP in Jinzhai County is about 1.8 x 103 MWh and 1.389 Mt per year. (2) The PPAP in Jinzhai County can recover the total costs and get benefits within three years, at least after completion. (3) Dynamic subsidy policy is needed to prevent over-scale or excessive government investment in PPAP. (4) The utilization of PPAP needs to be strengthened to transform the current "blood transfusion type" of poverty alleviation that relies more on government subsidies into more sustainable "hematopoietic style" poverty alleviation. This study is of significance to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the performance of PPAP and give better utilize the role of renewable energy in promoting energy conservation, carbon emission reduction, and economic development.

This article uses fixed effects regression to estimate the effect of social security transfers including contributory pensions and social allowances on the consumption expenditure of the receiving households in Vietnam. The article also investigates the effect of social security transfers on poverty in Vietnam. It is found that both pensions and social allowances increase expenditure of households, especially expenditure on non-food consumption. Pensions and social allowances reduce poverty of both the recipients and the whole population.

TI Impact of the Belt and Road Initiative on Poverty Reduction in Countries
   along the Route
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Poverty reduction is an important driving force for the global realization of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the building of a global community with a shared future for mankind. This paper takes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a quasi-natural experiment. Based on the panel data of 134 countries in the world from 2000 to 2018, this paper uses the difference-in-difference (DID) model to examine the impact of the BRI on poverty reduction in countries along the route and to study its internal mechanism from the dual perspectives of trade openness and investment openness. The results show that (1) the BRI can significantly reduce the incidence of poverty with the impact coefficient stable at -0.26, and the empirical conclusion has passed the parallel test, placebo test, and instrumental variable test; (2) the mediating effect test model shows that the BRI can achieve poverty reduction through the dual openness of trade and investment, and the intermediary effect of trade openness is greater than investment openness; and (3) from the perspective of heterogeneity analysis, geographically, the BRI has a slightly higher role in promoting poverty reduction in landlocked countries than in coastal countries. In terms of economic location, the effect of poverty reduction has a certain "pro-poverty" characteristic, that is, the BRI promotes poverty reduction in low- and middle-income countries far more than other types of income countries. Therefore, we believe that the continuous deepening of the BRI high-quality construction and the strengthening of cooperation among countries along the route will play a key role in promoting the international cycle of trade, investment, and other factors, as well as the cause of poverty reduction in the region and the world.

TI Child Poverty in China-A Multidimensional Deprivation Approach
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This paper applies a human-rights based deprivation approach to measure child poverty in China based on secondary data analysis. It discusses the following questions: How to select available deprivation indicators to measure child poverty in China? Are the available deprivation indicators valid, reliable and additive? How did child poverty change between1989 and 2009 and how did it vary by region? The main objective is to use existing longitudinal and cross sectional survey data to build scientific deprivation indicators to measure the living standards of children and produce estimates of child poverty in China across time and space. All waves from 1989 to 2009 of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data will be utilized. In order to choose a set of deprivation indicators, several statistical tests for the validity, reliability and additivity of the deprivation items are developed. Validity tests aim to check whether income has a significant association with deprivation indicators; A Classical Test Theory (CTT) model is used to determine if the list of deprivation items form a reliable scale/index.; The final test shows whether the deprivation indicators are additive or not. This methodology builds on the work of Gordon (2000, 2006) and final list of valid, reliable and additive deprivation indicators is applied to explore child poverty across time and space. The findings indicate that children's living standards in China have improved over time but that significant regional disparities remain.

TI Foreign Aid and the Quest for Poverty Reduction: Is Aid to Agriculture
   Effective?
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Development statistics estimate that three quarters of the poor live in rural areas and most of them depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihood. Consequently, research focusing on economic growth and poverty reduction has found that sustainable rapid transition out of poverty requires a special emphasis on the agricultural sector. This study contributes to the debate on aid effectiveness by disaggregating total aid into subcategories and specifically investigating the relationship between aid given to the agricultural sector and poverty reduction. If agricultural development is more effective in reducing poverty than some other types of development, then foreign aid directed towards agriculture may be more efficient in increasing the well-being of the poor than aid directed to some other sectors or uses. Our analysis uses panel data for developing aid recipient countries to empirically test this relationship. We find a significant relationship between agricultural aid and poverty reduction in our estimates.

TI The Effects of the Transmigration Programme on Poverty Reduction in
   Indonesia's Gorontalo Province: A Multidimensional Approach
SO ECONOMIES
AB The transmigration program in Gorontalo Province plays an important role in poverty reduction. The districts of Gorontalo and Boalemo, as a part of Gorontalo Province, were purposefully selected as research locations. A total of 240 respondents of transmigrant and local households were interviewed using a questionnaire containing a list of questions with a 5-Likert scale. The objectives of this research are: (1) to measure the multidimensional poverty level of transmigrant and local households, (2) to determine the impact of the transmigration program on poverty reduction and (3) to identify the factors that influence poverty status of transmigrant and local households. The results show that the poverty level of transmigrant households tends to be lower than local households. The longer the placement of transmigration, the more likely it is to reduce regional poverty levels. The health dimension has a high contribution to the cause of poverty of transmigrants, while the education dimension contributes to the highest cause of poverty of local households. The results of the analysis also show that farmers who are more educated, participate in skills training and have a side business have more opportunity to reduce poverty. The study confirms that the transmigration program has a significant impact on poverty reduction in the region.

CL Bari, ITALY
AB This paper deals with poverty decompositions into subgroups defined with respect to intervals of income and the robustness of comparisons of the absolute contribution of such groups to poverty. For instance, world poverty estimates by the World Bank often distinguish between the extreme poor whose incomes are lower than $1.25 a day (in PPP terms) and the other poor with incomes between $1.25 and $2.5 a day. Existing dominance conditions can tell whether overall poverty and extreme poverty have declined in a robust manner when comparing countries at two points of time, but they cannot say anything for the contribution of the non-extreme poor to overall poverty. In the present paper we propose stochastic generalized dominance criteria to perform robust poverty ordering when the focus is placed on some interval of the poverty domain. Using generated data based on grouped data from World Bank's PovcalNet tool, the paper finally investigates whether the robust decline of extreme poverty around the world during the last decades was also accompanied by a decline of the contribution of non-extreme poverty.

TI Zakat and Poverty Alleviation in a Secular State: The Case of Muslim
   Minorities in the Philippines
SO STUDIA ISLAMIKA
AB Twelve million Filipinos live in extreme poverty. Despite a well-crafted government model for poverty alleviation, the state's role in managing charities to alleviate economic deprivation has been minimal. By reason of the state's strict adherence to secularism, the operation of Islamic institutions at the social level is deemed unconstitutional. It is unfortunate that the dynamics of Islamic social financial institutions, i.e. zakat, waqf and sadaqah, are not reflected in the economic road map for the reconstruction of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, particularly the rehabilitation of the city of Marawi after the war. This study examines the initiatives taken by government agencies and Muslim organizations towards the gradual revival of zakat as an Islamic social financial institution. In addition, the study highlights issues on the management of zakat and its role in poverty alleviation within the context of a secular state. This study finds that due to mismanagement, zakat fails to eliminate or reduce the poverty of the Muslim minorities in the Philippines.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB Poverty alleviation has continuously become one of the main concerns of the socio-economic policy worldwide. This crucial phenomenon is bounded on necessity toward monetary and comprehends by social, economic, political, and physiological aspects. In Malaysia, although the New Economic Policy in 1971 has succeeded in reducing the country's poverty incident, poverty's pocket continues to exist with high incidences of poverty among specific ethnic groups and localities. For instance, rural poverty among the Iban community in Sarawak has occurred since Malaysian independence. Therefore, this paper examines the rural residents' perceptions of the State's role in poverty alleviation in Sarawak using a qualitative approach. Findings revealed that although the government has various programs to alleviate poverty, the social assistance related to poverty was not efficiently distributed in Sarawak's rural areas. This study also revealed that a lack of social infrastructures, such as road accessibility, has significantly influenced social assistance's efficiency distribution in rural areas.

TI Urban-rural Integration and Poverty: Different Roles of Urban-rural
   Integration in Reducing Rural and Urban Poverty in China
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Poverty is a common problem faced by all countries. Breaking the restrictions on urban-rural development imposed by the dual urban-rural system, China has greatly succeeded in eradicating absolute poverty, which has important reference significance for other developing countries to reduce poverty. However, few studies have systematically and empirically tested the heterogeneous impact of urban-rural integration (URI) on urban and rural poverty reduction. Using China's provincial panel data and the spatial econometric model, this study explores the relationship between URI and poverty reduction and tests its spatial spillover effects. The results show that URI and rural poverty present an inverted U-shaped relationship, which first aggravates and subsequently alleviates rural poverty. That has spatial overflow. For urban poverty, URI first reduces and then increases urban poverty in the province. In contrast, URI and urban poverty have an inverted U-shaped relationship in the surrounding province. By calculating the inflection point value, this study finds that when the URI level is between 0.300 and 0.480, URI can contribute to urban and rural poverty reduction in the local and surrounding areas. In the future, the government should dynamically monitor changes in urban and rural poverty while improving the development of URI.

The method is a classical optimization method using a greed optimization strategy. This means an iterative process, where only one poverty diminishing parameter is changed by 10% from its earlier value at each iteration. Expenses are also optimized to reduce inequality as measured by the Gini-coefficient. Revenues and expenses are balanced at every iteration. Certain parameters of social assistance were found to be the most effective in reducing poverty. However by raising substantially the basic unemployment benefit, basic pensions, housing benefits and study grants - leaving social assistance untouched - poverty was reduced by under 50 percent. This means that social assistance is still required to reduce poverty further. Costs are most effectively financed by raising capital income tax.

TI Poverty Reduction in Rural India During 2004-2005 to 2011-2012: Role of
   Growth, Redistribution, and Population-Shifts
SO REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
AB We assess the relative importance of factors contributing to poverty reduction in rural India, between 2004-2005 and 2011-2012, a period when India was one of the fastest growing economies of the world, at the national as well as sub-national level. We quantify the relative importance of population shifts across land size classes in determining the pace of poverty reduction vis-a-vis the intra-land size class growth in average consumption and redistribution components. While we do not find population shifts to be a statistically significant factor in explaining poverty reduction, we find that growth in intra land consumption is the dominant factor accounting for poverty reduction in each Indian state as well as at the national level. While the impact of redistribution component varied at the sub-national level, overall, it marginally impeded the pace of poverty reduction at the national level.

TI Tourism and poverty reduction: Empirical evidence from China
SO TOURISM ECONOMICS
AB This study empirically examines whether tourism affects poverty reduction based on the panel data of Chinese provinces for the period from 1999 to 2014. Using more comprehensive Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index to decompose poverty into three indices, namely, headcount ratio, poverty gap, and poverty severity, we investigate the relationship between tourism and poverty indices within a single framework. The empirical analysis indicates that tourism has a positive effect on poverty reduction and the concomitant inequality in the distribution of income among the poor could weaken the poverty reduction effect of tourism. China's western provinces confirm a stronger relationship between tourism and poverty reduction, although the effect of tourism on poverty in the eastern provinces is nearly negligible. We also identify possible mechanisms by which tourism may have an impact on poverty. The results provide empirical evidence to provide an improved assessment of the pro-poor effect of tourism in China.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB This exploration aims to effectively improve the data security of the financial poverty alleviation system, and provide a new idea for realizing highly credible targeted poverty alleviation. The centralized structure of the existing targeted poverty alleviation system leads to excessive power and a lack of trust. Hence, a decentralized targeted poverty alleviation system based on Ethereum blockchain technology of Internet of things technology is proposed. The system records personnel information, poverty alleviation data and funds in the blockchain to ensure the data credibility and security. A method of combining blockchain and InterPlanetary File System is proposed to jointly maintain the query and storage of large text data. It reveals that the application products using Ethereum blockchain technology have the characteristics of distribution, autonomy, contract execution and traceability. They will become mainstream applications in future development and can help society enter a highly trusted big data era. Ethereum blockchain has grown in the financial field and other fields. Moreover, the new model of Ethereum blockchain combined with government work can make government work more standardized, rigorous and credible. The research contribution is to propose an architecture based on Ethereum blockchain technology to realize automatic transaction generation and processing by combining smart contracts.

TI Do the photovoltaic poverty alleviation programs alleviate local energy
   poverty? -Empirical evidence of 9 counties in rural China
SO ENERGY
AB As an innovation of the Chinese government energy policy, solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects (PPAPs) play a positive role in solving energy shortages and poverty reduction. However, there is limited research on energy poverty in China's PPAP areas. This study has proposed a three-dimensional theoretical model for energy poverty, evaluated the energy poverty in the PPAP areas and analyzed its influencing path. The results show that: (1) The implementation of PPAPs has improved energy poverty to various degrees in all three types of solar resource areas; (2) The availability of energy services is the most prominent problem in energy poverty, and the PPAPs improve the availability of energy services the most; (3) Farmers' economic status and education have the greatest impact on alleviating energy poverty, and (4) The PPAPs directly improve the availability of energy services by increasing power generation and stability of the grid, and indirectly affect the cleanliness of energy consumption and energy affordability through farmers per se, thus affecting local energy poverty. Thus, public policies for promoting clean energy and energy utilization technologies (such as solar PV, etc) would help alleviate energy poverty in the rural areas.

TI Inequality and the impact of growth on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa: A
   GMM estimator in a dynamic panel threshold model
SO REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB The need for a good understanding of the relationship among poverty, inequality, and economic growth has become a significant concern in poor countries. This paper, therefore, empirically analyzes the triangular relationship among extreme poverty, income inequality, and economic growth for the 45 middle and low-income sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2010-2021. This study examines the effect of economic growth in extreme poverty reduction, with emphasis on the role of income inequality. We found that the nexus between these three variables is nonlinear. Our empirical results show that the economic growth begins to reduce extreme poverty when income inequality is at or below a threshold of 35.28 for the low-income countries and 45.15 for the middle-income countries. Meanwhile, the results indicate that there is no relationship between economic growth and extreme poverty above the inequality threshold levels of 35.28 and 45.15 for the low-income and the middle-income countries, respectively. On the basis of the findings, this study proposes several policy recommendations.

TI Beyond Economics! The (Evolving) Role of Law in the Eradication of
   Extreme Poverty
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL WORK
AB Extreme poverty is a complex and multifaceted challenge that cannot be solely addressed through economic interventions. Traditional economic indicators, such as GDP, do not fully capture the realities of vulnerable populations who often experience discrimination and social exclusion. This has legal and human rights implications, particularly in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa where extreme poverty is concentrated. In light of these concerns, this article critically examines the existing literature on poverty economics and law and presents an analysis of key data. Ultimately, the article argues for a comprehensive approach that prioritises law and justice as crucial components of efforts to achieve target 1 of the United Nations' Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. This approach should entail the establishment of legal frameworks that promote accountability for political actors and protect the rights of the poor.

AB Community projects aimed at alleviating poverty under the supervision of social workers employed by the Department of Social Development (DSD) in the Waterberg district of the Limpopo Province seem to be collapsing. This prompted the researchers to undertake a qualitative study using a contextual, descriptive and explorative research design aimed at obtaining an in-depth understanding of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms applied in supporting community projects for alleviating poverty. This article reports on findings based on interviews conducted with 21 participants. The study identified a lack of knowledge and training, as well as poor management and supervisor support as contributors towards weak M&E.

AB The study analyzes how the male and female headship of households affects poverty vulnerability in Tanzania. The study uses a sample for the 2017-18 HBS covered the population residing in private households in Tanzania Mainland. A representative probability sample of 9,552 households was selected. Probit regression with instrument variables for the endogenous variable (education) is used for estimation. The results imply that, in general, female-headed households are less likely to face extreme poverty than their male counterparts. The study also reveals that extreme poverty is less likely with the female head when divorced or widowed. Finally, the results imply that extreme poverty varies across different regional zones in the country. Therefore, female in Tanzania can shield their households from extreme poverty.

AB Forests and trees provide a range of goods and services vital for human well-being, particularly for people who live below the poverty line. Yet a number of important knowledge gaps remain regarding the relationship between forests, trees, and poverty dynamics. Here, we highlight five research priorities that require urgent attention if policy makers and practitioners are to realize the potential for forests and tree-based systems to contribute to poverty alleviation. These are: examining forest-poverty dynamics, especially over the medium- to long-term; assessing the relative effectiveness of different forest-related policy and management interventions for poverty alleviation; identifying the key barriers to more equitable, just, and sustainable use of forests and trees, and ways to overcome them; expanding the evidence base to cover under-represented geographies and contexts; and bringing to light the 'hidden dimensions' of forest contributions to poverty alleviation.

TI Poverty reduction effects of integrating high-quality development and
   cultural tourism in China
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The integration of the cultural tourism industry with high-quality development is believed to be an important method of alleviating poverty. Most research in this area has focused on single towns, cities, or regions with-out considering the spillover effects of neighboring areas. To fill this gap, this study applies a spatial panel econometric model to empirically test the spatial spillover effects of integrating the cultural tourism industry with high-quality developments and their mechanisms of poverty alleviation based on provincial panel data of the Chinese Mainland from 2010 to 2020. Four key results are presented. First, there is an obvious spatial de-pendence on the high-quality development scale, specialization level, and poverty level of cultural tourism in-tegration. The common panel model is found to overestimate the impact of this integration on poverty allevia-tion because it ignores the spatial spillover-related explanatory variables. Second, the scale of development quality is found to have no significant impact on poverty alleviation when integrating cultural tourism; how-ever, the level of development specialization has both a direct impact on poverty alleviation and the spatial spillover effect. Third, the integration of the cultural tourism industry in the Central and Western regions is shown to have a strong direct effect on poverty reduction through high-quality development. However, the spillover effect on poverty reduction in the Eastern region is greater than that in the Central and Western re-gions. Fourth, the integration of high-quality development and cultural tourism is found to have a direct im-pact on poverty alleviation overall by promoting tourism consumption, material capital accumulation, and structural transformation.

SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB The Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) concept is mainly based on Coasean economics theory that emphasizes the creation of a voluntary or market-based transaction for ecosystem services. Alternatively, many PES practiced in developing countries are based on Pigouvian economic theory allowing government intervention such as through regulation, tax or subsidy. A hybrid PES approach that compound Coasean and Pigouvian theory was developed in West Lombok Indonesia leading to a new policy paradigm that combines elements of both a voluntary market-based and mandatory policy-based system. This study aims to assess how the hybrid PES program contributes to poverty alleviation. By employing a participatory econometrics approach, this study found that the hybrid PES system does not contribute to poverty alleviation in shortterm. It is possible that this PES program contributes to poverty alleviation in long-term.

TI Resources or Capital?-The Quality Improvement Mechanism of Precision
   Poverty Alleviation by Land Elements
SO LAND
AB With China facing the challenges of fragmentation, multidimensionality, and the dynamics of relative poverty under the present situation, more attention is being paid to the role of land in poverty alleviation. In order to improve the quality of precision in poverty alleviation, it is urgent to clarify the micromechanisms of precision poverty alleviation methods that utilize land elements. On the basis of panel data from 29 provinces from 2010 to 2016, this research uses a panel vector autoregressive model to empirically analyze the mechanisms of interaction among land resource endowment, land capital endowment, and rural poverty. The research results show that the improvement of land resource endowment has had a relatively prominent effect on short-term poverty reduction, while the improvement of land capital endowment has had a relatively longer-term effect on the improvement of rural poverty. Land capital endowment and rural poverty can constitute a positive, cumulative circular effect, which can play a sustainable role in improving poverty. The increase in land resource endowment has a positive effect on land capital endowment, but excessive increases in land capital endowment were found to have a negative effect on land resource endowment. Therefore, the implementation of land element resource-based and capital-based poverty alleviation policies can distinguish between shorter-term and relatively longer-term goals, enabling a more accurate improvement of the quality of poverty alleviation. At the same time, this approach is more sustainable, since it makes full use of the circular effect constituted by land capital endowment and rural poverty. However, attention should be paid to preventing damages to land resource endowment, which can be caused by the excessive capitalization of land.

TI The effects of rural education on poverty in China: a spatial
   econometric perspective
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB Poverty alleviation has attracted extensive attention worldwide. This paper investigated the spatial agglomeration effect and dynamics driving rural education levels (namely, primary education, junior secondary education, and senior secondary education) and rural poverty in 27 provinces of China in 2010-2017. The results of a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model revealed that different education levels have distinct effects on rural poverty, and the impact of compulsory education on rural poverty is greater than that of senior secondary education. We further found that rural poverty in a region is clearly not only internally driven but also impacted by the poverty rate in the surrounding provinces, suggesting that regional poverty alleviation policies should combine regional education differences and learn from poverty alleviation through education experience in surrounding areas. Thus, the findings established in this paper have significant implications for targeted poverty alleviation measures in China by improving education.

AB IThis paper studies the situation and status of pro-poor tourism in a county in China. In recent years, the Chinese government has paid more attention to the development of poverty alleviation. As an important part of the national poverty alleviation strategy, pro-poor tourism has become an industrial poverty alleviation model generally favored by all sectors of the society. The poverty-stricken population, as the target of pro-poor tourism, has been the focus in the related studies. The paper analyses the current poverty situation and tourism development status in a specific region - the Nanzhao county, Henan province. The empirical results show that the development degree of the scenic area, different demographic characteristics and the relationship between residents and tourism will affect the local residents' perception of the pro-poor tourism effect. Some suggestions are put forward on the development of poverty alleviation as well as the related tourism product development in the county.

TI Abolishing inequity, a necessity for poverty reduction and the
   realisation of child mortality targets
SO ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB The first Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1) due in 2015 concerns poverty reduction. It has been claimed to be fulfilled on a global level, but still more than 1 billion people are living in abject poverty. There is a strong link between the economy and child survival, and only a minority of countries will have reached the MDG target for child mortality reduction by 2015. This paper discusses the relationship between poverty and child survival. It argues that a focus on equity is necessary to further reduce child mortality, through poverty reduction in absolute terms and also through targeting interventions for increased child survival to disadvantaged populations. The political will to actually achieve real change for those in greatest need is crucial but not to be taken for granted, and the distribution rather than the generation of wealth needs to be made a priority in the post-MDG era.

TI Progress towards millennium development goal 1 in northern rural
   Nicaragua: Findings from a health and demographic surveillance site
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB Background: Millennium Development Goal 1 encourages local initiatives for the eradication of extreme poverty. However, monitoring is indispensable to insure that actions performed at higher policy levels attain success. Poverty in rural areas in low-and middle-income countries remains chronic. Nevertheless, a rural area (Cuatro Santos) in northern Nicaragua has made substantial progress toward poverty eradication by 2015. We examined the level of poverty there and described interventions aimed at reducing it.
   Methods: Household data collected from a Health and Demographic Surveillance System was used to analyze poverty and the transition out of it, as well as background information on family members. In the follow-up, information about specific interventions (i.e., installation of piped drinking water, latrines, access to microcredit, home gardening, and technical education) linked them to the demographic data. A propensity score was used to measure the association between the interventions and the resulting transition from poverty.
   Results: Between 2004 and 2009, poverty was reduced as a number of interventions increased. Although microcredit was inequitably distributed across the population, combined with home gardening and technical training, it resulted in significant poverty reduction in this rural area.
   Conclusions: Sustainable interventions reduced poverty in the rural areas studied by about one-third.

TI What really happened to child poverty in the UK under Labour's first

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB Child poverty in Britain fell in Labour's first term, though by much less than micro-simulation exercises suggested. Nonetheless, the decline is statistically significant, and is greater if measured just in the last 6 months of 2000/1, rather than the whole year. The decline also proves robust to the choice of poverty line, although that which the Government has emphasised (60% of contemporary income) shows a somewhat bigger drop than an other than any other poverty line that is a fraction of median income. Among those who remain poor, the average shortfall in measured income below the poverty line has increased since 1996/7. Looking ahead, the methodology currently used in official poverty statistics may limit the potential to reduce child poverty significantly further.

AB This paper attempts to explain why China performed better than India in reducing poverty. As two of the most populous countries in the world, China and India have both experienced fast economic growth and high inequality in the past four decades. Conversely, China adopted a more export-oriented development strategy, resulting in faster industrialization or urbanization and deeper globalization, than India. Consequently, to conduct the comparative study, we first decompose poverty changes into a growth and an inequality components, assessing the relative importance of growth versus distributional changes on poverty in China and India. Then, Chinese data are used to estimate the impacts of industrialization, urbanization and globalization on poverty reduction in rural China. The major conclusion of this comparative study is that developing countries must prioritize employment generation in secondary and tertiary industries through industrialization and globalization in order to absorb surplus agricultural labor, helping reduce poverty in the rural areas.

TI From Equality of Deprivation to Disparity of Prosperity: The
   Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle in Post-reform China
SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB In the post-reform era, China achieved poverty reduction that was unprecedented in human history This poverty reduction was accompanied by fast growth and worsening income distribution. The present paper examines the poverty-growth-inequality triangle in China by: (i) providing growth, inequality and poverty profiles at the national and provincial levels; (ii) uncovering the contributions of growth and inequality changes to poverty reduction; and, finally, (iii) drawing lessons for other developing countries. Based on the World Bank's definition of the poverty line, China has already eliminated abject poverty, even though the poverty rate was as high as 88.3 percent in 1981. The remarkable record in poverty reduction is predominantly attributable to growth. The effect of inequality varied in different periods. In addition, the impact of growth on poverty reduction is found to be diminishing over time, a phenomenon worth further research and policy attention.

TI Poverty dynamics in Botswana: Policies, trends and challenges
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This paper provides an overview of poverty dynamics in Botswana from 1980 to 2014. It highlights, poverty-alleviation policies that have been implemented, the trends in poverty as well as the challenges that have been faced in reducing poverty. The main objective of this article is to discuss the successes that have been achieved and the challenges that have been faced in Botswana on poverty alleviation, with the view that other countries facing poverty challenges can learn from the dynamics. Poverty-reduction policies implemented in Botswana are three-pronged. Firstly, there are policies that increase income and livelihood for the poor. Secondly, there are policies that support infrastructure development especially in basic service provision like health and education. Thirdly, there are policies that focus on short term relief-targeting the poor and the vulnerable through social welfare programmes. Despite all the policies that have been implemented, it can be concluded that Botswana (like many other developing countries) still faces a number of challenges related to poverty reduction.

SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB Understanding and addressing the factors that affect progress in antipoverty interventions is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In Bangladesh this topic has been largely explored through quantitative approaches, and we believe in-depth qualitative analyses of household dynamics in the context of antipoverty interventions is lacking. This article addresses this lacuna. Based on 49 focus group discussions and 15 case studies, we analyse livelihood dynamics of beneficiary households within a national extreme poverty alleviation program. We identify five determining factors to the effectiveness of antipoverty interventions: 1) health shocks, natural hazards, and vulnerabilities; 2) household demography; 3) inappropriate IGA planning, implementation, and monitoring; 4) dependence/inaction; and 5) political and social instability. We argue that livelihood-based antipoverty initiatives often fail because they do not address these five factors, and call for a comprehensive approach that prioritises them in program design.

TI Poverty and Subjective Poverty in Rural China
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB China is undergoing a campaign which is called "The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy" to eradicate extreme poverty from rural China until 2020. Though poverty in rural China has been studied intensively in different objective dimensions, little attention has been paid to poverty line settings and subjective poverty, which are hinged to the policy effects. In order to fill in the research gap, this study employs a nationally representative survey of rural households in 2016, to measure subjective poverty in rural China, and analyze the determinants as well. Our results indicate that the mean subjective poverty line of the rural households is 8297 yuan per capita, which is far higher than the national poverty line (2800 yuan). Statistically, 29% of the surveyed rural households who are not objectively poor feel subjectively poor. The objective poverty line cannot fully reflect the subjective poverty perception. Thus, how to reduce the subjective poverty perception could be a major policy agenda in rural China after 2020, when extreme poverty is no longer a problem.

TI Small ruminants as a pathway to reduce urban poverty: An empirical
   analysis of Sudan
SO VETERINARY WORLD
AB Aim: This study aimed to measure the energetic incidence of poverty and determines the main factors that cause urban poverty. Moreover, the study examines the key role of the livestock sector in poverty reduction in urban regions and develops an analytical tool to aid in urban area poverty mitigation through goats and sheep ownership.
   Materials and Methods: The study mainly depends on primary data assembled through structured and unstructured questionnaires, which were distributed among the targeted groups in the urban area in Sudan. Poverty line and poverty indices were calculated and measured using various well-known methods. The causes of poverty were estimated using logistic regression, and the effect of small ruminants in poverty alleviation was estimated using multivariate regression analysis.
   Results: The study findings indicate that both food and income poverty lines are less than the standard poverty line. In addition, the results imply that rural migration and crime predictors are among the most important factors in increasing urban poverty in the study area. Furthermore, livestock ownership has a significant impact on poverty reduction.
   Conclusion: The study concludes that small ruminants are playing a key role in reducing urban poverty. Thus, the study urges planners and policy-makers to support policies that promote livestock sector development as a strategy to alleviate poverty in Sudan.

TI The varying roles of ecosystem services in poverty alleviation among
   rural households in urbanizing watersheds
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Context Understanding the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in rural areas of rapidly urbanizing watersheds is one of the core research questions of landscape sustainability science. It is important for poverty alleviation and forming related policies. However, there is insufficient investigation on the impacts of ecosystem services on poverty alleviation on multiple scales in such region. Objectives This paper investigates whether ecosystem services at the landscape level and household characteristics play important roles in connecting ecosystem services and poverty alleviation in a rapidly urbanizing landscape from the perspective of landscape sustainability science. Methods We use an urbanizing watershed with a large number of poor people, analyzing the impacts of ecosystem services on poverty alleviation among different types of rural households based on surveys, nonparametric tests, and multinomial logit models. Results The results suggested that differences in household-level endowments had significant impacts on poverty alleviation. In terms of ecosystem services, regional (village-level) food supply were significantly associated with poverty alleviation (p < 0.1); while household-level benefits from cultural services had a significant positive effect (p < 0.01) on households moving to the better-off group. Conclusions Differentiating the roles of ecosystem services on poverty alleviation between landscape level and household level is important for policy making. In urbanizing watersheds, offering ecological compensations, and providing trainings and financial supports for rural poor people should be adopted to help them get out of poverty.

TI Poverty reduction and adult education: beyond basic education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFELONG EDUCATION
AB One of the Millennium Development Goals declared by the United Nations in 2000 was to reduce by half the population of people living in extreme poverty, by 2015. Adult education can and should contribute significantly to this development goal. Nevertheless it has hardly been explored so far in the national Poverty Reduction Strategies Papers. In as far as attention has been given to the contribution of adult education to the reduction of poverty, the trend has been to focus on literacy or basic education. Nevertheless, adult education is potentially much more than literacy or basic education. Successful contribution of adult education to poverty reduction programmes includes also agricultural extension, vocational education, community development and training for active citizenship. In this introduction of the special issue of the International Journal of Lifelong Education, we will sketch the state of the art for each of these branches of adult education. Moreover, our central argument will be that developing countries do not only need a more extended system for adult education, but also a more flexible and more targeted system than the rather traditional practices in most developing countries.

TI Community-campus partnerships, collective impact, and poverty reduction
SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB This article describes a unique Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)-funded project in which a community-campus partnership is making progress in moving the needle on complex issues such as poverty. The project identified various models of community campus partnerships that help leverage collective impact efforts in poverty reduction. One model involves a center for community-university research, while others revolve around champions in the community or university who spearhead the initiatives and leverage successful partnerships into research activities. Concurrently, the campus and community partners have engaged in research with a goal of having an impact on poverty reduction. The models are examined in terms of components of collective impact: a common agenda, shared measurement, mutually reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and a backbone organization. Factors were identified that support and impede collective impact, such as the importance of a strong backbone organization, and vulnerability to personnel changes.

TI The relationship of child poverty to school education
SO IMPROVING SCHOOLS
AB Child poverty is a global issue that affects around half the children in the world; it is inextricably bound to the poverty experienced by their parents and families and has been identified by the United Nations as a human rights issue. Child poverty can be a barrier to children and young people accessing school education or achieving any form of success through participating in school education. This article examines some of the main issues surrounding child poverty and school education and a number of government interventions designed to enhance the education of disadvantaged children (exemplified in the United Kingdom). The article will argue that some of these interventions have had some success, although they need to be contextualized in the wider educational and political context. The article offers an alternative vision of intervention in schools drawn from research from the United Kingdom, America and Australia.

Two sets of policies have been underlined: poverty alleviation (jinzhun fupin) plan to improve the targeting accuracy of these programmes and policies to focus on adjacent regions with disadvantaged natural and economic conditions. However, the efficacy of these programmes has been saddled with issues including low government capacity and the difficulties to mobilise the private sector.

TI Entrepreneurship at the Base of the Pyramid: The Moderating Role of
   Person-Facilitator Fit and Poverty Alleviation
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Facilitating entrepreneurship through micro-credit, micro-franchise, and micro-consignment potentially helps to alleviate desperate poverty. However, the effectiveness of these facilitators have varied from positive outcomes of poverty alleviation to negative outcomes of increased debt. Therefore, we seek to understand: how and why are different facilitators of entrepreneurial activity at the Base of the Pyramid (BOP) relatively more effective at alleviating poverty? Building on the foundation of person-entrepreneurship fit, we introduce the construct ofperson-facilitator fitand develop propositions about how and why the fit between entrepreneurs and the different facilitators of entrepreneurship may influence poverty alleviation. Specifically, using a remediation perspective, we explicate how thedemands-abilitiesandneeds-supplies fitbetween an entrepreneur and the different facilitators of micro-credit, micro-franchise and micro-consignment moderates the likelihood of poverty alleviation and how person-facilitator fit moderates the magnitude of poverty alleviation over time. We offer theoretical and practical implications of our framework for different perspectives (remediation, reform, and revolution) on entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation.

TI Solar photovoltaic interventions have reduced rural poverty in China
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Since 2013, China has implemented a large-scale initiative to systematically deploy solar photovoltaic (PV) projects to alleviate poverty in rural areas. To provide new understanding of China's targeted poverty alleviation strategy, we use a panel dataset of 211 pilot counties that received targeted PV investments from 2013 to 2016, and find that the PV poverty alleviation pilot policy increases per-capita disposable income in a county by approximately 7%-8%. The effect of PV investment is positive and significant in the year of policy implementation and the effect is more than twice as high in the subsequent two to three years. The PV poverty alleviation effect is stronger in poorer regions, particularly in Eastern China. Our results are robust to alternative specifications and variable definitions. We propose several policy recommendations to sustain progress in China's efforts to deploy PV for poverty alleviation. There lacks a comprehensive analysis on the large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaic projects and its impact on poverty alleviation. Here the authors show that solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation pilot policy increases per-capita disposable income in a county by approximately 7%-8%.

TI Poverty alleviation as business strategy? Evaluating commitments of
   frontrunner multinational corporations
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB In the debate on how to combat poverty, the positive role of MNCs is frequently mentioned nowadays, although doubts and criticism remain. Facing this societal debate, MNCs feel the pressure to formulate a position. This paper analyzes MNCs' policies on their poverty-alleviating potential. "Frontrunner" MNCs turn out not to be very outspoken, especially not on those issues that have the largest potential to help alleviate poverty. Placed in the context of other MNCs' behavior, a sector-coordinated morality seems important, which means that a meso approach to poverty alleviation needs to complement the current global (macro) and individual company (micro) focus.

TI Financing Social Innovation for Poverty Reduction: A Case Study of
   Microfinancing and Microenterprise Development in Bangladesh
SO SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Microfinancing is widely perceived to contribute towards social innovation for poverty reduction. We examined the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) programme implemented by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) between 2002 and 2007, as it used an innovative approach to microfinancing by transferring assets rather than cash to ultra poor participants. We examined two aspects: (i) the impact of microfinancing through asset transfer instead of cash on social innovation leading to poverty reduction; (ii) the factors that contributed to positive or negative impact on the economic conditions and poverty levels of the participant households and the trajectories of changes experienced by the success and failure cases. For this, we employed survey data from twenty-one beneficiaries and eight in-depth interviews among these households. The study found that participants who demonstrated proper planning, hard work and personal interest in the enterprise through microfinancing have witnessed improved quality of life and poverty reduction, while lack of motivation, absence of proper planning and certain social barriers resulted in failure. Our study makes two major contributions: (i) it fills a gap in the literature on microfinancing of social innovation to help ultra poor households to graduate out of poverty; (ii) it provides policy alternatives for designing appropriate microfinancing programmes for ultra poor which can produce high success rates in reducing poverty through social innovation not only in Bangladesh, but also in other developing countries.

AB This paper explores the symbiotic relationship between indigence and the informal sector in Chile. Based on two complimentary studies of the PUENTE Program, which aims at the eradication of extreme poverty, and building on a model that explained the logic of the rural domestic units, the paper proposes a new model for understanding the economic logic underlying the urban domestic units (UDUs). These units represent the urban and semi-rural families living in extreme poverty or indigence. The paper argues that unless anti-poverty policies and efforts are grounded in theories emerging from the realities of the target population, their results will be grim at best.

TI Estimating China's poverty reduction efficiency by integrating
   multi-source geospatial data and deep learning techniques
SO GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB Poverty threatens human development especially for developing countries, so ending poverty has become one of the most important United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study aims to explore China's progress in poverty reduction from 2016 to 2019 through time-series multi-source geospatial data and a deep learning model. The poverty reduction efficiency (PRE) is measured by the difference in the out-of-poverty rates (which measures the probability of being not poor) of 2016 and 2019. The study shows that the probability of poverty in all regions of China has shown an overall decreasing trend (PRE = 0.264), which indicates that the progress in poverty reduction during this period is significant. The Hu Huanyong Line (Hu Line) shows an uneven geographical pattern of out-of-poverty rate between Southeast and Northwest China. From 2016 to 2019, the centroid of China's out-of-poverty rate moved 105.786 km to the northeast while the standard deviation ellipse of the out-of-poverty rate moved 3 degrees away from the Hu Line, indicating that the regions with high out-of-poverty rates are more concentrated on the east side of the Hu Line from 2016 to 2019. The results imply that the government's future poverty reduction policies should pay attention to the infrastructure construction in poor areas and appropriately increase the population density in poor areas. This study fills the gap in the research on poverty reduction under multiple scales and provides useful implications for the government's poverty reduction policy.

Major findings include: (1) NGO-led projects are superior to government-led projects in the aspects of scientific and democratic decision-making, poverty targeting and the degree of participation of beneficiaries in the project; (2) different poverty reduction models are significantly different in: (I) the degree of democracy of project decision-making, scientificalness and rationality of project targeting, participation of beneficiaries, project budget, project schedule and post-project management mechanism; (ii) the forms of participation in project decision-making by beneficiaries particularly by women; (iii) the level of democracy and farmers' awareness of self-management regarding post-project management mechanism. Policy implications are proposed accordingly based on these findings.

TI Evolution in the Impact of Pro-Poor Policies on Farmers' Confidence:
   Based on Age-Period-Cohort Analysis Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Age-Period-Cohort Model is used in this paper to examine how farmers' confidence has changed in response to various measures for reducing poverty, based on data from 13,559 household tracking surveys, with a view to inform rural poverty reduction policies within Targeted Poverty Reduction Strategy (TPRS). The findings indicate that: (1) Farmers who get monetary grants have significantly lower levels of confidence than farmers who do not. The difference between the ages of 18 and 70, where this issue is more noticeable, grew between 2013 and 2018. (2) Between 2010 and 2018, transfer employment was more likely than monetary handouts to increase farmers' confidence, and this difference was particularly obvious among young people (18-45 years old) and elderly individuals (65+). (3) The confidence gap between farmers with and without medical insurance has widened over time. Farmers with medical insurance have significantly higher confidence than farmers without it. Lessons for TPRS suggest that to reduce poverty among poor groups in a way that is both stable and sustainable, poverty alleviation strategies should take psychological factors into account when evaluating their efficacy. They should also concentrate on how employment boosts self-confidence.

AB Small Island Developing States like the Caribbean islands face a challenge in securing watersheds and freshwater to service competing water demands from various economic sectors. Processes of prioritisation for access to water often lack equity, represent the interests of industrial demands, and marginalize interests and water needs of the poor. Regional Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers are based on traditional economic indicators and give scant attention to the poverty and forest resource nexus and therefore inadequately reflect the actual and potential role of forest resources in alleviating rural poverty. Poverty related issues were once perceived as solely the domain of government ministries responsible for social affairs. However, there has been a shift and many sectors, including the forests and watershed management sector, now strive to incorporate poverty reduction elements in policy formulation. The challenge remains one of coordinating strategies under various portfolios for poverty reduction while ensuring access to water and forest resources by the poor.

TI The effects of poverty alleviation investment on carbon emissions in
   China based on the multiregional input-output model
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The effective coupling of poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction goals is an important requirement for sustainable economic development in the present day. In this paper, we utilized socioeconomic data to construct a multiregional input-output (MRIO) table for 27 industries in 30 provinces of China. Multiregional input-output analysis and carbon emission intensity analysis were applied to analyze the effects of poverty alleviation investment on carbon emissions. We found that an investment in poverty alleviation has produced an increase in China's economic aggregate growth from 2010 to 2017. During this time period, the fastest economic growth occurred in 2012 and the regions with the greatest economic drivers were Yunnan and Guizhou. Regarding the industry sector, the construction industry and non-metal products industries had the highest contribution to economy. The economic contribution of the agricultural and food processing industries was insufficient. Poverty alleviation in 26 provinces effectively reduced carbon emission intensity, and the effects were continuously optimized from 2010 to 2017. However, this effect in Inner Mongolia and other 3 provinces was weak. In addition, the effect of carbon emission reduction in the energy production and mining industries was not ideal. This study focuses on the effect of poverty alleviation investment on carbon emissions, which can provide policy guidance for poverty alleviation and green economic growth in China.

TI Sexual Violence and Child Poverty: Lived Experiences of Child Sexual
   Violence Survivors in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH
AB Existing literature has documented strong associations between families' socio-economic conditions and children's experiences of child abuse and neglect (CAN), including physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Even though the broader approach to family poverty and child poverty may overlap, they do not always have the same indices, implying that the established relationships between family poverty and CAN cannot be unequivocally applied to child poverty. Specifically, inadequate attention has been given to developing an evidence base for understanding the relationship between CAN and child poverty, especially in Nigeria. Even in developed countries, reports on the extent of child poverty have rarely included information about child abuse. Using the hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this study explored lived experiences of 19 female adolescent survivors of child sexual violence (CSV) (Mage approximate to 16, SD = 0.36) in Nigeria. Data was gathered through interviews and victims' experiences were aggregated using content analysis. The major findings were summarized under the following themes: (1) linkage of CSV with child poverty outcomes (2) implications of poor services for CSV survivors, (3) alternate resources for provision of CSV services, (4), survivors' suggestions on CSV reduction and proper intervention. The study recommended a multi-sectorial and multi-stakeholder approach to implementing strategies to curb CSV in Nigeria.

TI "Are We Doing Fine?" The Views on Poverty Reduction Strategies Among
   Front-Line Workers in the Field of Social Assistance in Turkey
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH
AB This research highlights the views of front-line workers in the social assistance system in Turkey about the strategies of poverty reduction and the effectiveness of the assistance given by Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundations (SASFs) to the poor. The data were gathered from 33 employees from the 8 SASF offices in Ankara, Turkey. The results show that the majority of the participants agree with governmental efforts to create employment opportunities as the most important method. Although the participants felt the services they provided were effective at the individual and family level, they thought such services were extremely insufficient in terms of poverty reduction on a macro scale. The findings were discussed within the framework of the changing nature of poverty and the recent agenda on poverty reduction in Turkey. Future research based upon larger samples from different parties in the field of social assistance is needed to fully determine the positions taken by the agents.

AB This study analyses the market response of listed companies' Targeted poverty alleviation information disclosure on the basis of equity financing cost. Results show investors' positive feedback to such disclosure and reduced equity financing cost. Moreover, mediation effect tests show that the decrease of information asymmetry between investors and companies plays a part of the mediating role. These findings indicate that Targeted poverty alleviation has a policy spillover effect, and listed companies' participation can balance social welfare and self-interest. This study enriches research on corporate Targeted poverty alleviation's economic consequences and provides new evidence for corporate social responsibility information disclosure-equity financing cost relationship.

TI Sustainability of rural tourism in poverty reduction: Evidence from
   panel data of 15 underdeveloped counties in Anhui Province, China
SO PLOS ONE
AB Based on the characteristics of underdeveloped areas, this paper selects the panel data of 15 underdeveloped counties in Anhui Province from 2013 to 2019 and uses the panel threshold model to empirically analyze the sustainability of rural tourism development. The results show that: (1) Rural tourism development has a non-linear positive impact on poverty alleviation in underdeveloped areas and has a double threshold effect. (2) When the poverty rate is used to express the poverty level, it can be found that the development of rural tourism at a high level can significantly promote poverty alleviation. (3) When the number of poor people is used to express the poverty level, it can be found that the poverty reduction effect shows a marginal decreasing trend with the phased improvement of the development level of rural tourism. (4) The degree of government intervention, industrial structure, economic development, and fixed asset investment play a more significant role in poverty alleviation. Therefore, we believe that we need to actively promote rural tourism in underdeveloped areas, establish a mechanism for the distribution and sharing of rural tourism benefits, and form a long-term mechanism for rural tourism poverty reduction.

AB Often it is assumed that fairtrade certification leads to poverty alleviation in the Global South. This review applies fairtrade to the determinants of pro-poor economic growth. The main determinants of pro-poor economic growth are trade, investments in human capital, health, financial development, just to name a view. Some of those determinants are highly affected by fairtrade (food) certification. Consequently, fairtrade certification is able to foster pro-poor economic growth and thus, alleviates poverty in the Global South.

AB Poverty is a worldwide phenomenon that affects continents, countries and people differently; it affects people in both urban and rural areas. This study investigated the mediation role of foreign aid on the relationship between human capital factors (i.e. education, health and vocational training) and poverty reduction strategy implementation in republic of Chad located in the sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, a total of 550 questionnaires were distributed to the target respondents which were community leader, member of independent association, foreign aid representative and non-governmental organization (NGO). After data cleaning, a total of 537 questionnaires were used for the analysis. Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) software was used as the tools for data analysis. The findings show that there is direct effect from both education and vocational training on poverty reduction strategy implementation. But health does not have positive effect. In addition, the result revealed that foreign aid mediates the relationship between education and poverty reduction strategy implantation and also it mediates the relationship between vocational training and poverty reduction strategy implantation.

TI An empirical investigation of the link between infrastructure
   development and poverty reduction The case of India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - India is a developing nation where the marginal benefit of infrastructure development is tremendous. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between infrastructure development and poverty reduction for India using the yearly data from 1991 to 2015.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the principal component analysis to construct indices for four major sub-sectors, namely, transport, water and sanitation, telecommunications and energy, falling under the broad infrastructure sector and then using these sectorwise indices, the authors construct an overall index which represents infrastructure development. The authors provide evidence on the link between infrastructure development and poverty reduction by using the auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach.
   Findings - The ARDL test results suggest that infrastructure development and economic growth reduce poverty in both long run and short run. The causality test confirms that there is a positive and unidirectional causality running from infrastructure development to poverty reduction.
   Research limitations/implications - The study confirms that India's Infrastructure development plays a vital role in reducing poverty and calls for the Indian Government to adopt economic policies which are aimed at developing and strengthening the infrastructure levels and bringing in more investment in the infrastructure sector in order to help the poor population by making them exposed to better opportunities of employment and income growth, thereby achieving the goal of poverty reduction.
   Originality/value - This paper is a fresh and unique attempt of its kind to empirically investigate the causal relationship between infrastructure development and poverty reduction in India using modern econometric techniques.

TI Stakeholders strategies in poverty alleviation and clean energy access:
   A case study of China's PV poverty alleviation program
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Poverty reduction and access to clean energy are two challenges highlighted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. China's Photovoltaic (PV) Poverty Reduction Program provides an archetype model to address those two questions simultaneously. Using a tripartite game of government, enterprise and household, this paper examines the challenges that have impeded the development of China's PV poverty alleviation program. Based on an evolutionary game model and the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) model involving the three major parties, this study shows that: (1) Governmental monitoring and the active participation of both enterprises and households are essential to achieve a win-win-win outcome; (2) the government plays a leading role in monitoring and encouraging the active participation of enterprises and households and resolving the conflicts between enterprises and households; and (3) households should have a minimum share in the project. The analyses imply the following policy suggestions such as ensuring optimal path selection for all parties, avoiding the abandonment of projects, increasing households' sense of ownership and creating accessible finance.

TI Urban Green Infrastructure for Poverty Alleviation: Evidence Synthesis
   and Conceptual Considerations
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB The multiple benefits of urban green infrastructure (UGI) that support sustainable cities are increasingly acknowledged, and yet the bulk of research over the past decade or so has focused on only a small subset of the numerous benefits, notably recreation, physical and mental health, and regulating services. In contrast, there is very little information on the contribution of UGI to several of the other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in particular SDG 1 of reducing poverty, despite the pervasiveness of poverty globally. This paper considers the diverse direct and indirect ways in which UGI can contribute to poverty alleviation, drawing on the limited evidence from various regions of the world. The direct links between UGI and poverty alleviation is via three means, namely provision of (1) consumptive or provisioning goods such as wild foods and firewood, (2) employment in UGI development, maintenance, and restoration, and (3) land for urban agriculture, income generation and dwelling. There are also a number of indirect links such as cash savings, improved physical and mental health, improved social networks, improved educational outcomes, and regulation of potential natural disasters. However, the commonly unequal distribution of UGI within and between cities means that the poverty alleviation potential and benefits are inequitably distributed, often against those who are most in need of them, i.e., the urban poor. This demands greater attention to promoting the equitable distribution and quality of UGI and mainstreaming of UGI into poverty reduction strategies and programmes and vice versa, as well as greater examination of the links between UGI and poverty alleviation in a greater range of contexts.

TI Current Situation and Trends of Poverty in Bangladesh
SO IPRI JOURNAL
AB Poverty governance in developing countries constitutes an important part of global poverty governance as it is a major obstacle to the sustainable development of human society. Bangladesh has carried out numerous economic as well as trade liberalization reforms since the early 1990s with sustained and accelerated economic growth and formulated a series of measures to reduce poverty, with remarkable results. However, Bangladesh is still stuck in the paradox of a poverty trap regardless of achieving poverty reduction. The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2019, gravely impacted the poverty reduction efforts made in Bangladesh, large number of poverty-stricken people returned to poverty, exceeding the number of extremely poor people. Although series of poverty reduction measures have taken place in Bangladesh, yet it has not solved the poverty problem in the country. Based on the "Household income and Expenditure Survey, released by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, this paper analyzes the current situation and the development trend of poverty in Bangladesh by combining some international poverty indexes. Finally, the paper explains the actual poverty situation of Bangladesh, its causes,, and recommends some relevant measures.

TI Older adults with disability in extreme poverty in Peru: How is their
   access to health care?
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Disability rates increase with age. In 2012, Peruvian older adults (. 65 years) represented 9% of the population. Additionally, older population reported disabilities at about 5 times the rate of Peruvians between 36 and 64 years old, and 30% of older population lived in poverty. Peruvian seniors living in extreme poverty experience disabilities and the extent of their access to healthcare is unknown.
   Objective
   This study assesses associations between disability and access to healthcare among Peruvians older individuals living in extreme poverty.
   Methods
   Secondary analysis of a national representative population based survey that utilizes information from Peru's 2012 survey Health and Wellbeing in Older Adults (ESBAM), which includes older adults living in extreme poverty. We define disability in terms of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL disability) framework. Healthcare access was assessed as having any of Peru's available health insurance schemes combined with preventive health services (vision assessment, influenza vaccination, blood pressure assessment, diabetes screening, and cholesterol assessment). Poisson robust regression models were used to evaluate the associations among relevant variables. Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported.
   Results
   Data from 3869 individuals (65 to 80 years old), of whom 1760 (45.5%) were females, were analyzed. The prevalence of ADL disability was 17.3% (95%CI: 16.0%-18.4%). In addition, more than 60% had never received any of the preventive measures evaluated, except for the blood pressure assessment. In the adjusted model, people with ADL disability had 63% less probability of having extensive insurance, compared to those without disability (p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   This study shows that this Peruvian older population living in extreme poverty has limited access to healthcare services. Although there was no consistent association between ADL disability and the healthcare access, there is an urgent need to reduce the inequitable access to healthcare of this poor Peruvian older population.

TI Household Enterprises and Poverty Reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB Employment in Household Enterprises (HEs) has been an integral part of the recent economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet employment and development strategies tend to exclude the sector, despite the fact that households with HEs tend to be richer. A good example is Mozambique, where 34% of households rely on income from this source. Analysis of household livelihoods using panel data shows that starting HEs is associated with upward wealth mobility and poverty reduction, particularly for rural and poorly-educated households. Targeted programmes directed towards the constraints to HE creation, survival and income growth would be likely to enhance the effectiveness of employment and poverty reduction strategies in Mozambique as well as in other low income countries in SSA.

AB The main purpose of this study was to holistically understand the role of empowerment in urban poverty eradication of the Indian community in the urban areas of the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The poverty eradication effectiveness was tested by analysing community empowerment domains and MyKasih programme run by a non-governmental organisation. There are numerous studies conducted to understand the issues of poverty in Malaysia. However, few studies have so far focused on the minority community in Malaysia. Moreover, there is no recent study to test the effectiveness of any governmental or NGO's poverty eradication efforts on this minority community. This study utilised a qualitative approach and an in-depth interview was used to gather the data. The respondents were single mothers living in a poverty-stricken area in the capital city of Malaysia.

TI Assessing the role of civil society in poverty alleviation: A case study
   of Amathole district in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa
SO TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB The purpose of this study was to conduct an assessment of the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) in poverty alleviation, with a particular focus on three CSOs operating in the Amathole district of the Eastern Cape province. The CSOs were located in the local municipalities of Amahlathi (Ikhwezi Women Support Centre), Mbhashe (Nyhwarha Home-Based Care) and Mnquma (We Care HIV/AIDS Ministries). A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods was used. Data were collected from 14 people either working for or associated with the CSOs using semi-structured interviews, structured interviews in which a questionnaire was administered and focus groups. Document analysis supplemented these data collection methods. The findings showed that different interventions by the CSOs played an important role in improving the well-being of community members but that the interventions did not necessarily focus directly on poverty alleviation. Where the CSOs made a direct contribution to poverty eradication, it was done by employing community members in their projects. The challenges that they experienced largely concerned funding and insufficiently skilled human resources. The CSOs were able to plan and monitor their performance, but the logical framework they used failed to prepare them for unexpected changes in their projects. Focused management support from the Department of Social Development will assist the CSOs to become sustainable.

TI SPATIAL CONFLICT AND INFLUENCING FACTORS OF ECOLOGICAL PROTECTION AND
   SUSTAINABLE POVERTY ALLEVIATION CAPACITIES OF THREE-RIVER- SOURCE
   NATIONAL PARK
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB Using the coupling model and geographically weighted regression model, we investigate spatial conflicts and influencing factors of the ecological protection and sustainable poverty alleviation capacity of Three-River-Source National Park. Results show that the coupling coordination degree is 0.5270, which indicates reluctant coordination and the spatial conflict is obvious; the main influencing factors of the spatial conflict between the ecological protection and sustainable poverty alleviation capacities are the ecological governance ability of the government, the degree of resource dependence and per capita disposable income.

TI Artificial intelligence and poverty alleviation: Emerging innovations
   and their implications for management education and sustainable
   development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) could help humanity achieve the ambitious goal of eradicating extreme poverty. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly, in its declaration Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, boldly proclaimed the aspirations of the nations of the world to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere." No Poverty is the first of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, humanity is not on track to accomplish this ambitious goal; the COVID-19 pandemic has increased joblessness and economic disruption pushing additional millions into extreme poverty and rolling back the gains in poverty alleviation over the past three decades. This paper briefly explores the theoretics of poverty, recent trends in management education, and emerging innovations in AI. It provides some examples of AI implementation in the agriculture sector and draws inferences from these diverse but coalescing transformations in AI, management education, and sustainable development.

TI Policy strategy and instruments for alleviating rural poverty
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
AB The emphasis in government policy on target-group specific and social sector related government expenditure for poverty alleviation programmes and neglet of government expenditure for agricultural growth together with an ad hoc policy approach to farm input subsidies and interest rates for rural credit in addition to the misdirected policy of relying oil relative farm prices as an engine of agricultural growth are disconcerting developments as agricultural growth and poverty alleviation are perfectly compatible objectives. Against this background this paper analyses the prerequisites of-alleviation of absolute rural poverty with a view to identifying a strategy and policy priorities for poverty alleviation.

TI Potential effect of aquaculture promotion on poverty reduction in
   Sub-Saharan Africa
SO AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a policy of increased support of aquaculture development in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the region, aquaculture expansion has the potential to create new jobs and improve food security among poor households. Three computable general equilibrium models were used to estimate the effects of aquaculture expansion and increased input productivity on poverty reduction in Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania. The results suggest that there will be positive effects on per capita income for all households in Ghana and Kenya. In Tanzania some rich households will experience income loss, because of resource shift from other sectors to aquaculture. Because of reduction in poverty associated with price reductions, and increases in minimum income associated with income expansion, the poverty gap decreased in all household groups. Because of high sectoral linkages, aquaculture development is a potential candidate for sector-specific policy support to address poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Digital financial inclusion and poverty alleviation: Evidence from the
   sustainable development of China
SO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB Digital financial inclusion (DIFI) exerts vital influence on poverty alleviation in China, thus developing digital financial inclusion may provide new approaches to inclusive growth and create more possibilities for the sustainable development with extending the coverage and usage concerning financial services. This research explores how poverty alleviation is impacted by digital financial inclusion derived from the provincial data of China from 2011 to 2019. The results show that digital financial inclusion can make considerable contributions to poverty alleviation significantly. We conduct heterogeneity analysis with quantile regression conjointly, which reveals that digital financial inclusion has divergent effects on users with diverse poverty levels. The results of mediation regression demonstrate that the income level and income distribution play a vital role in poverty alleviation. Moreover, based on spatial Dubin model, digital financial inclusion enhances poverty alleviation with a spillover effect, which correlates with a "U"non-linear relation, laying a hidden danger of increasing poverty. Finally, we carry out IV regression to enhance the robust results, proving the reliability of this research's basic conclusion.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

TI The State, the Market, Economic Growth, and Poverty in China
SO POLITICS & POLICY
AB The reform of agriculture in China is cited by scholars advocating economic growth through market reform. Such scholars argue that this aspect of reform has been characterized by the liberalization of markets for agricultural commodities, which spurred production, increased rural incomes, and reduced poverty. This view exaggerates the roles played by open markets and economic growth in that reform. This article argues that the role of the state in redistributing public assets, establishing institutions that supported markets, and designing and implementing poverty reduction policies also reduced poverty in China. I conclude that scholars, not just in China's case but also more generally, should examine the economic and political effects of various possible relationships between state and market. I offer this as one way forward in deepening our understanding of the role of politics and policy in promoting development and reducing poverty.

TI How inclusive financial development eradicates energy poverty in China?
   The role of technological innovation
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Although numerous policies and measures in China are aimed at accelerating energy poverty eradication, few scholars have investigated the nexus between China's inclusive financial development (IFD) and energy poverty. To this end, we first evaluate the composite index of China's IFD, and then empirically investigate the energy poverty eradication effect of IFD by applying the differential generalized method of moments (Diff-GMM) technique based on the sample data of China's 30 provinces between 2004 and 2017. We also conduct an asymmetric analysis and detect the moderating and mediating roles of technical innovation in the linkage be-tween IFD and energy poverty. The primary findings imply that: (1) improving the development of China's in-clusive finance can help eradicate energy poverty, and the interaction of inclusive finance and technical innovation can strengthen this effect; (2) the energy poverty eradication effect of IFD is mainly caused by strengthening the supply of energy services and improving energy management institutions; (3) IFD and tech-nical innovation show an asymmetric correlation with energy poverty at different quantiles; and (4) China's IFD not only directly eradicates energy poverty, but also has an indirect promotion effect on energy poverty eradi-cation by accelerating technical innovation. We propose some policy implications related to supporting inclusive finance, strengthening technical innovation, and considering regional heterogeneity.

TI To make growth reduce poverty, industrialize: Using manufacturing to
   mediate the effect of growth on poverty
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB MotivationWhile economic growth is usually necessary to reduce poverty, it is often not sufficient. Industrialization, especially manufacturing, tends to create jobs that are more productive than in other sectors, and which pay more, thereby reducing poverty. Structure of production therefore matters as well as growth of production. PurposeHow much does industrialization mediate the relation of economic growth to poverty reduction? Methods and approachWe deploy Causal Mediation Analysis, with industrialization as the mediator. The mechanism decomposes the impact of economic growth into direct effects on poverty, and those that apply indirectly through the mediator of industry.Data comes from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre and UNU-WIDER Economic Transformation Database (ETD) which covers 51 countries in the global South from 1990 to 2018. FindingsEconomic growth directly reduces poverty, but the full impact arises from the mediating role of industrialization. Almost 50% of the impact on poverty occurs through employment in manufacturing. Policy implicationsSocial policies to reduce poverty will be incomplete if the production structure of economy is disregarded. Economic policy must consider the importance of industrial economic activities to amplify the impact of economic progress. On the contrary, policies promoting economic growth without creating industrial jobs will fail to offer accurate solutions to the poverty problem.

TI Leveraging E-Learning and Community Assets to "TEACH" Residents to
   Address Child Poverty
SO ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal child poverty curriculum for pediatric residents.
   METHODS: The Trainee Education in Advocacy and Community Health (TEACH) curriculum trains residents to recognize and address the effects of child poverty, utilizing learning objectives modified from the US Child Poverty Curriculum, new interactive web-based modules, experiential learning, and reflection. This mixed-methods evaluation of the first component, "Epidemiology of Child Poverty," includes nearly 2 years of resident participation. Pre/post knowledge and attitudes regarding child poverty were assessed. Behavior change was evaluated in a subset of participants using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), comparing intervention and control groups of residents. Residents' experience with the curriculum was assessed using qualitative analysis of debrief sessions with faculty.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two residents completed the curriculum between June 2018 and March 2020. Residents increased in knowledge (P < .001) and confidence (P < .0001) in recognizing and addressing poverty. They also self-reported greater preparedness (P < .001) and effectiveness (P < .001) in addressing social determinants of health. Early data from the OSCE have not shown a statistically significant change in skills compared with a control group. Qualitative themes included an increase in empathy for, understanding of, and responsibility to address the effects of poverty in caring for patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal "Epidemiology of Child Poverty" portion of the TEACH curriculum increased resident knowledge, confidence, and empathy. Given the ubiquitous nature of poverty and the generalizability of the online modules, the TEACH curriculum can be a resource for other residency programs.

TI The Future of Global Poverty
SO REALISTIC HOPE: FACING GLOBAL CHALLENGES
AB To achieve the first of the Sustainable Development Goals - to end poverty in all of its forms everywhere by 2030 - will require more than business as usual. Despite uncertain global economic growth we have the financial resources to end extreme poverty. We know more, can predict more, and ultimately can better target the extreme poor. Social entrepreneurship models, machine learning, and robotics are pushing the envelope of what we can do. Using three scenarios, the chapter illustrates what poverty could look like in 2030. Our success will ultimately depend on the levels of global cooperation around conflicts and climate change, economic growth that benefits all segments of society, and the inclusion of minorities and previously excluded groups.

We focus on cash benefits directly related to the presence of children and we attempt to isolate the effects of policy changes from other broader socio-economic developments on poverty reduction. We build a counterfactual scenario based on income indexation to answer the question of what would have happened if the policies had not been changed. We find that recent changes have improved the poverty reduction power of family benefits, overall, but especially among children and families with numerous children.

TI Assessing the Stability of Poverty Alleviation from a Household Economic
   Perspectives
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB From the perspective of household economy, the application of a multiscale spatial econometric model to realize the objective evaluation of county-level poverty alleviation stability is a core issue in rural economics research. The improvement of economic income and livelihood conditions for small farm holders are significant manifestations of poverty alleviation stability. Quantitative evaluation of the county-level poverty alleviation stability can provide a scientific basis for the adjustment of rural economic policy and high-quality development of regional economy by the multiscale spatial econometric model. This study realizes the quantitative evaluation of county-level poverty alleviation stability by constructing the evaluation index system, taking five counties in China's Yunnan Province as an example, using the exact 2242 survey datasets, and adopting the multiscale spatial econometric model. The main idea of the model is to obtain the score of poverty alleviation stability by weighted summing of dimensions on the basis of weight calculation of each evaluation index. Results revealed the following: (1) County-level poverty alleviation stability includes the stability of regional poverty alleviation and the stability of farmers' poverty alleviation, which is mainly affected by the combined effect of five factors, including economic and ability status, cognitive level, supporting facilities, and social governance. (2) Based on the multiscale spatial econometric model, the overall poverty alleviation stability in the five counties is relatively low, with Zhaoyang District showing the highest stability, followed by Yiliang, Yuanyang, Honghe, and Gongshan. (3) Farmers' poverty alleviation stability in all counties, except Zhaoyang, is higher than that in the region. County-level gross domestic product and fiscal revenue are the dominant factors affecting the stability of poverty alleviation in the region, while the dominant factors affecting the farmers' poverty alleviation stability are the level of per capita net income and labor force proportion in the household population. (4) To enhance poverty alleviation stability, this study suggested enhancing the level of economic development in counties and strengthening the collective economy of the village, innovating the form of economic development of the village, taking the enhancement of the development capacity of counties, relying on resource advantages to actively develop special industries, and improving the stability and sustainability of income generation for farmers. Meanwhile, we propose to further improve the conditions of regional infrastructure and enhance the capacity of public services. The findings can help enrich the theoretical research system of rural economics, expand the scope of research on small-holder farming systems, and provide a reference for diversification of small farm holders economy, the improvement of agricultural farming technology, and the high-quality development of regional economy in China.

Child poverty exit rates were significantly loiter, and poverty entry rates significantly higher, in Britain. We decompose these cross-national differences into differences it: the prevalence of "trigger events" (changes in household composition, household labor market attachment, and labor earnings), and differences in the chances of making a poverty transition conditional on experiencing a trigger event. The latter are the most important in accounting for the cross-national differences in poverty exit and entry rates.

TI Financial development and poverty reduction in India: an empirical
   investigation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial sector development and poverty reduction in India using annual data from 1970 to 2012. The paper attempts to answer the critical question: does financial sector development lead to poverty reduction?
   Design/methodology/approach - Stationarity properties of the series are checked by using Ng-Perron unit root test. The paper uses the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound testing approach to co-integration to examine the existence of long-run relationship; error-correction mechanism for the short-run dynamics and Granger non-causality test to test the direction of causality.
   Findings - The co-integration test confirms a long-run relationship between financial development and poverty reduction for India. The ARDL test results suggest that financial development and economic growth reduces poverty in both long run and short run. The causality test confirms that there is a positive and unidirectional causality running from financial development to poverty reduction.
   Research limitations/implications - This study implies that poverty in India can be reduced by financial inclusion and financial accessibility to the poor. For a fast growing economy with respect to financial sector development this may have far-reaching implication toward inclusive growth.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind to empirically examine the causal relationship between financial sector development and poverty reduction in India using modern econometric techniques.

AB Poverty alleviation loan plays an important role in the poverty alleviation strategy of China. To improve the loan service efficiency and reduce service cost, it is necessary to build a management system for this business. However, current management systems for the loan are usually deployed in single service mode, also the transactions are not transparent and traceable to most of the roles participating in the process. Its data privacy protection mechanism is not robust enough facing various cyber attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose loan on blockchain (LoC), a novel poverty alleviation loan management system based on smart contracts. A digital account model is designed for the transfer of assets between centralized and decentralized ledgers, and locking and unlocking algorithms are introduced for smart contracts. Digital signature and oracle are introduced to protect the data privacy.

TI Eradicating poverty among the waste workers through waste collection? A
   case study of Dhaka City
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The objective of this paper is to examine the factors affecting the waste collection to poverty reduction among the waste workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Particular interest is on the question whether the contribution of some determinants actively plays a role in reducing the possibility of being poor. This issue is particularly significant since it has been argued in various relevant literatures. There is potential for the waste picking sector to play an important role in alleviating poverty of the waste workers. This research provides the empirical evidence for answering this question by estimating a logistic regression model using primary data gathered within Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Research results showed that the education of the respondent, number of the dependent in family, training, and collection of recyclable items were significant negative predictors at 5% level of significance. Framing policy to develop skilled waste workers could be an effective strategy towards implementing a sustainable waste management system in Bangladesh. The findings of this study imply that promoting organised and systematic waste management activities, such as intensifying urban industrialisation with formal sector, will have a positive impact on efforts to reduce poverty.

TI The effects of location and sectoral components of economic growth on
   poverty: Evidence from Indonesia
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction by differentiating growth and poverty into their sectoral composition and urban-rural location using data from Indonesia. We find that rural services growth reduces poverty in all sectors and locations. However, urban services growth has the largest effect on poverty in most sectors. Finally, we also find that rural agriculture growth strongly reduces poverty in rural areas, the largest contributor to poverty in Indonesia. This implies that while agriculture growth in rural areas still plays a major role in reducing poverty, policies that enable strong growth in the services sector in both urban and rural areas would expedite poverty reduction.

TI The impact of trade liberalization on poverty reduction in rural China
SO CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how trade liberalization influences rural poverty reduction in China.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors make use of China Family Panel Studies survey data, take annual income of farmers of RMB2,300 and RMB3,450 as the poverty lines (poverty line 1 and poverty line 2, respectively). Residents below poverty line 1 and poverty line 2 are 2,580 and 2,661, respectively. Probit model is used to estimate the impact of trade liberalization on the poverty probability. Income-deciding equation is used to estimate the impact of trade liberalization on the income level of poor residents in rural areas. Income-deciding equation is also used to examine the transmission mechanism of trade liberalization affecting rural poverty.
   Findings This study finds that trade liberalization can reduce the poverty probability of rural residents and promote the income growth of poor residents in rural areas. Trade liberalization increases the income of poor residents and reduces poverty through transmission mechanisms such as promoting economic growth and financial expenditure.
   Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study to quantitatively model the impact of trade liberalization on rural poverty reduction in China using residents' survey data.

TI Investigating the empirical relationship between government intervention
   programs and poverty alleviation: a case of Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Purpose Although the literature has shown that government intervention programs on poverty alleviation have now become a common practice and accepted policy framework in tackling the menace of poverty which has remained the major challenge to all leaders around the globe. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of (conditional cash transfer, youth empowerment and microcredit scheme) on poverty alleviation in Niger state-Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses of the study were tested using personally administered questionnaires survey method; 442 valid and useable questionnaires were obtained for the study, while PLS-SEM path modeling was adopted to evaluate the statistical relationship between those three programs and poverty alleviation. According to the statistical result of the study, the research constructs have a satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity. Therefore the study has established a strong positive relationship between government intervention programs and poverty alleviation. The socioeconomic assessment of the respondents further justified the above assumption. Findings Also, the research findings of this study may found to be beneficial to the government, international organization, researchers particularly those who are conducting research on poverty reduction programs. Research limitations/implications The study used the perceptions of the beneficiaries of those programs in nine selected local government areas within the three senatorial districts in Niger state-Nigeria. Originality/value Similarly, the findings of the study would offer some meaningful contribution to the body of knowledge on studies related to poverty alleviation programs like conditional cash transfer, youth empowerment and microcredit scheme, where expert in that field would explore the advantage of these findings by utilizing the impacts of those programs on the beneficiaries for policy framework.

TI Place attachment in the Ex-situ poverty alleviation relocation: Evidence
   from different poverty alleviation migrant communities in Guizhou
   Province, China
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB The Ex-situ poverty alleviation relocation (ESPAR) program is an important policy initiative taken by the Chinese government to eliminate poverty. In a short time, a large number of migrants have moved to new communities for a better standard of living and opportunities for improving their condition. Place attachment is an important topic in migration, closely related to the people-place relationship and social stability. However, there are few relevant studies on the place attachment of poverty alleviation migrants (PAMs). To fill in this gap, we studied five new migrant communities in Anshun, Guizhou Province. We find significant differences between the three different resettlement modes (resettlement in original villages, resettlement in nearby townships, resettlement in cities and towns) in the place attachment level. The results of multiple linear regression models indicate that community support, such as basic infrastructures, social interaction, economy, and living environment signifi-cantly affect the construction of place attachment. Moreover, some sociodemographic characteristics and relo-cation factors also have significant impacts. Further policy recommendations including appropriate choice of resettlement modes, material and emotional guarantees, and comprehensive community support are put forward to improve the effectiveness of ESPAR.

TI Community extension MSME's entrepreneurial activities in relation to
   poverty reduction
SO FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
AB IntroductionHigher Education Institutions play a role in poverty reduction by implementing community extension programs focusing on capacity building and entrepreneurship training. Cebu Technological University programs offer these programs through various skills training to its targeted beneficiaries. This study aims to assess the community extension Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) entrepreneurial activities concerning poverty reduction. The research participants are beneficiaries of community extension programs that primarily focus on capacity building and entrepreneurship training, and they eventually become entrepreneurs. MethodUsing a cross-sectional survey, 172 valid responses were analyzed, with entrepreneurship education (EE), budgeting financial literacy (BFL), access to credit facilities (ACF), and entrepreneurial performance (EP) as predictors of poverty reduction (PR). Results from Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) generate insights from the seven hypothesized paths of the proposed model. Results and discussionFindings revealed that entrepreneurship education (beta = 0.258, p < 0.05), budgeting financial literacy (beta = 0.147, p < 0.05), and access to credit facilities (beta = 0.541, p < 0.001) help reduce poverty. However, no significant relationship was found between entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction (beta = 0.132, ns) whose cause may be directly pointed to the pandemic's significant impact on MSME's entrepreneurial activities. ConclusionThis study confirms the importance of entrepreneurship education, budgeting, financial literacy, and credit access in promoting entrepreneurial success and reducing poverty.

TI Safari tourism and its role in sustainable poverty eradication in East
   Africa: the case of Kenya
SO WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES
AB Purpose
   Globally, poverty has been a persistent problem despite decades of unprecedented growth. The purpose of this paper is to deliberate on a sustainable livelihoods and poverty eradication approach in an African context.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper aims to bridge the gaps in poverty eradication strategies in East Africa by examining recent literature on livelihoods approaches and poverty eradication approaches.
   Findings
   Safari tourism is one way of connecting poor communities in Kenya to the tourism industry. The development of community conservancies in Kenya presents yet more opportunities for communities to be integrated with the sector. The Africanization of the tourism sector in Kenya is a priority, as communities embrace tourism and poverty eradication measures.
   Practical implications
   There is a need for the Safari tourism sector to integrate the local community's indigenous knowledge systems, community social capital and the community's natural capital with tourism product development and diversification.
   Originality/value
   The paper draws on applied research and technical analysis of the unique opportunities for enhancing sustainable poverty eradication through the tourism sector in East Africa and, more particularly, a Kenyan context.

SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB This study explores the socio-cultural and economic context in which Igbo women's basket weaving enterprise develops and operates in Nigeria and their beliefs about how entrepreneurial action can alleviate poverty. We conducted a qualitative study of 48 Igbo women entrepreneurs who run local basket weaving enterprise in 16 rural communities of 4 out of the 5 Igbo States (southeast region) of Nigeria, to explore the impact of informal entrepreneurial learning, socio-cultural and economic issues, individual values in business start-ups and development in the cities after post-primary education in an attempt to alleviate poverty in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1). Focusing on three dominant themes (including socio-cultural and economic issues of the Igbo women basket weaving entrepreneurs, etcetera) from the thematic analysis, we analyze the factors that contribute to understanding the socio-cultural context of the Igbo women's basket weaving enterprise in Nigeria. Findings provide a framework of the Igbo women entrepreneurs' poverty alleviation and show evidence of a perspective of entrepreneurship for poverty alleviation that is different from the mainstream entrepreneurship literature on poverty alleviation.

TI Child poverty and regional disparities in Turkey
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) defines child poverty as the inability of the child to realize their existing potential due to their inability to access resources across different dimensions of life (income, health, nutrition, education, environment, etc.). On the basis of this definition, an attempt has been made in this study to put forth the disadvantaged positions children have in different dimensions of their lives, specifically by taking regional disparities into account. As the data source, the Turkey Demographic and Health Survey 2008 is used, a survey that consists of detailed information about the different dimensions of child poverty. In this study, in order to measure poverty in four different dimensions (education and work, health and nutrition, family environment, and domestic environment), a total of 25 variables were used and descriptive and multivariate analyses were made in order to highlight the regional disparities in child poverty. Principle components analysis conducted through the use of a deficit approach reveals that the variables closely related with education and health and nutrition were the critical dimensions behind child poverty in Turkey. The results of this study indicate that 22.4% of children in Turkey are poor when various dimensions of life are taken into account; the region with the highest child poverty is Central East Anatolia, at 34.9%, while the region with the lowest rate is East Marmara, at 15.6%.

TI Child Poverty in Ontario: The Value Added of Material Deprivation
   Indicators for Comparative Policy Analysis in North America
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLICY ANALYSIS
AB North America lags behind in the use of outcome-based indicators such as material deprivation to study child poverty. Instead, income indicators dominate research and policy making. A large body of international research concludes that income poverty and material deprivation are complementary indicators because each measures specific but related aspects of material well-being. For children this distinction is even more pertinent because children have specific needs and their material circumstances affect both their current and future well-being. This research uses data from Ontario to investigate whether material deprivation also contributes to a better understanding of child poverty in North America. It shows that the choice of poverty indicator affects estimates of the level of child poverty, its correlates, and the success of policy interventions in reaching poor children.

The basic means based on a trust mechanism include the provision of loans only to women, five-person teams, a system of conference centers, personal financial management and weekly repayment with golden membership awards. Although the Grameen mode presents different practice effects around the world due to cultural differences, the fundamental cause for success is the respect showed to human beings by the model, and a tailored program that includes rather than excludes. The Grameen model has unique advantages in promoting poverty alleviation and reduction in Asian countries, which is of great significance for promoting Asian integration.

   DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB This paper examines Uganda's experience with external debt and debt relief measures, in particular, the country's experience with the HIPC Initiatives (the original and the Enhanced one), and their relevance to poverty reduction. The Ugandan government's attempt to improve its record on social development has led to the country's first Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) in 1997, the second installment of which in 2000 has become Uganda's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Though Uganda's PEAP is not without its weaknesses, continued adherence to its main principles should ensure sustained progress in poverty reduction. The HIPC assistance is expected to free significant budgetary resources for Uganda's poverty reduction strategy, thus allowing the country to implement the development goals set out in its PRSP. In fact, average budgetary savings over the period 2000-2015 due to HIPC assistance is estimated to amount to as much as US$55.5 million per annum.

TI Evolution of stakeholders' behavioral strategies in the ecological
   compensation mechanism for poverty alleviation
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Because poverty and natural resource conservation are multi-dimensional, complex interactive processes, ecological compensation (EC) mechanism, which is global environmental resource management policy instruments, have become important tools for poverty alleviation. This study developed a unified analysis framework that incorporated a tripartite evolutionary game that included EC-investors, who promote eco-compensated poverty alleviation, EC-providers, and superior government regulators. Based on proposed dynamic replicator equations, the evolution and steady state strategies for each of these stakeholders were then separately discussed. A numerical study based on the observable conditions in an eco-compensated poverty alleviation project was conducted to examine the asymptotic stability of the various evolutionary stabilization strategies. The results show that the government regulator's strategic choices act as a "weathervane" for the other two players, and the choice of the superior government regulator depends on the expected benefits and costs of the strategy. The strategic choices made by the EC-providers are significantly influenced by the EC-investor strategy choices, with a sufficient ecological transfer payment being the main motivation for the providers to participate in the eco-compensated poverty alleviation projects.

TI DOES FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT MATTER IN POVERTY REDUCTION? EMPIRICAL
   EVIDENCE FROM SOUTHEAST ASIAN ECONOMIES
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This study looked at the possibility that South Asian countries' financial prosperity may lessen poverty. The data presented in this research show that between 1990 and 2019, economic development directly led to a decline in poverty in South Asian nations. Remittances reduce poverty, but financial growth has a huge influence. The model result suggests that financial development strongly affects poverty reduction, regardless of the econometric methodology. The results demonstrated that whereas remittances increase poverty levels for men and women, economic development significantly reduces them. Poverty was decreased considerably by variables such as economic development, foreign direct investment and commercial openness. As a result of these expenditures, the South Asian population was shown to be more vulnerable to poverty. The South Asian population was more susceptible to poverty due to these outlays. The results also refute earlier research suggesting that rising poverty may result from financial instability.

TI Transport Accessibility and Poverty Alleviation in Guizhou Province of
   China: Spatiotemporal Pattern and Impact Analysis
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Both transport development and poverty alleviation are vital for sustainable development. However, due to the lack of long-term, comparable, county-level transport accessibility and poverty incidence data, the spatiotemporal patterns of these factors have rarely been accurately revealed in the poverty-stricken regions of China, causing the impacts of transport accessibility on poverty alleviation to be difficult to quantify. Taking Guizhou Province in China as the study area, this study revealed the spatiotemporal patterns of transport accessibility and poverty alleviation in 88 counties from 2000 to 2018 based on multisource data, including nighttime light data, LandScan population data, and transport network data. It was found that the transport accessibility decreased from 4.9 h to 3.3 h, and the poverty index decreased from 0.75 to 0.29 on average. All these factors exhibited a "core-periphery" spatial pattern. Furthermore, the panel data regression analysis suggested that transport accessibility has played a dominant role in poverty alleviation, with an elasticity coefficient of 0.839. In the future, policies concerned to integrate transport development with rural industries such as agriculture, e-commence, and tourism are recommended for poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, which are especially significant for promoting sustainable development, securing a win-win of economic growth and social equity.

TI CO2 emissions and poverty alleviation in China: An empirical study based
   on municipal panel data
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Industrial transition and climate change regulation to reduce CO2 emissions will affect employment and further influence social poverty. In this study, we measured CO2 emissions and the poverty-alleviation index based on socio-economic and energy consumption statistic data from 286 municipal cities in China for 2007-2014; analyzed relationships between CO2 emissions, employment rate, and poverty alleviation index using simultaneous equations; and interpreted the mechanism by which CO2 emissions influence social poverty at the municipal level. The results indicate that average CO2 emissions from China increased by 32.9%, with a rapid initial rise and then steady growth from 2007 to 2014, while the average poverty-alleviation index increased by 25.19% during the same period. CO2 emissions had a significant positive relationship with employment rate in all industries. In addition, employment rate was negatively correlated with poverty-alleviation in primary industry and positively correlated with poverty-alleviation in non-agricultural industry. Studying the mechanisms for CO2 emission impacts on poverty-alleviation can provide important references for adapting to global climate change, promoting sustainable development, and safeguarding the legitimate development rights of all countries, especially developing countries.

TI Poverty alleviation through labor transfer in rural China: Evidence from
   Hualong County
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Poverty-stricken areas in rural China are generally rich in working-age population, but lack of employment opportunities. Therefore, poverty alleviation through labor transfer (PALT) has become an important way to reduce poverty in rural China. This study employs the sustainable livelihoods framework to explore how labor transfer can help the poor fight against poverty based on document analysis and field investigation, and takes Hualong County of Qinghai Province as an example to analyze the specific practice and performance of PALT. The results show that labor transfer not only increases the per capita livelihood capital of the remaining population and optimizes the human-environment relationship but also helps the poor escape the background of vulnerability and achieve stable employment. To promote poverty alleviation based on the local conditions, Hualong County have established a PALT practice system, which guides the poor to more advantageous places to engage in hand-pulled noodle production and operation and related industries, and successfully achieved the goal of eliminating poverty. Ultimately, this article proposes that the Chinese government should implement targeted measures to improve the practice of labor transfer, and global poverty alleviation efforts should pay more attention to localized educational systems, regional economic development and international labor cooperation.

TI How do poverty alleviation coordinators help the impoverished in rural
   China? -- Evidence from the Chinese poor population tracking dataset
SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The loss of targeting efficiency due to information asymmetry is a longstanding problem in aid programs. China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program addresses this problem by assigning local government officials to individual impoverished households. These officials, referred to as poverty alleviation coordinators (PACs), are required to pay frequent home visits to the assigned households and to deploy policy resources for poverty reduction. The program is costly in terms of human resources because the officials also have regular duties in a variety of departments. We investigate the effects of the PAC system on poverty alleviation and explore the mechanisms of the effects. Based on the Chinese Poor Population Tracking Dataset and econometric analysis, we find that the households with a larger income increase are those whose PACs work in a department that has the type of resources needed by the household. This indicates that a good match between the resource and the need could enhance the effect of the TPA program. In addition, PACs at a higher position in the governance structure show a larger income increase in their assigned households, which is expected, because a higher position could have more resources to deploy. These findings shed light on role of institutional arrangements in alleviating information asymmetry in poverty reduction programs.

TI Research on the Evaluation of Industrial Poverty Alleviation under the
   Background of the Internet
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB With the advent of the information age in the 21st century, Internet technology has developed rapidly. With the development of agriculture, industry, and service industry, Internet technology has also achieved further innovation and cross-border integration. The rapid development of Internet technology has provided new ideas for poverty alleviation in poor areas of China and accelerated the speed of poverty alleviation in poor areas. Based on the assumption of China's industrial poverty alleviation and the analysis of the implementation center, this paper puts forward an evaluation method of industrial poverty alleviation effect based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, which is evaluated from three aspects: income structure, expenditure structure, and labor resources. Taking Wuxi County as an example, this paper discusses the combination of human capital theory and multidimensional poverty theory. The evaluation of poverty alleviation effectiveness includes four indicators (comprehensive analysis, evaluation system, policy implementation, poverty alleviation funds) and 21 secondary indicators. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is an objective, fair, and comprehensive evaluation of the overall level of poverty alleviation and development in Wuxi. The expert scoring method is used to calculate the weight of each index and determine the level of members and the industrial situation of China's industrial poverty alleviation. According to the scores of each evaluation index, the poor households in Wuxi County are very satisfied with the person in charge of help, the villager group, the way of helping, and the effect of helping.

TI Fluctuation and Spillover: Poverty Reduction Effect of Rural Public
   Expenditure Scale Based on Spatial Poverty
SO APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB In rural poverty governance, one of the most significant challenges faced by developing countries is to reduce the negative impact of economic growth fluctuations on poverty reduction, so as to achieve a win-win situation of "economic growth and poverty reduction". Based on the provincial-level panel data and data of poverty-stricken counties from 2000 to 2016 in China, this paper evaluates the poverty reduction effect of rural public expenditure from the perspectives of cyclical fluctuation and spatial spillover by using the instrumental variable method. It was found that rural public expenditure is pro-cyclical, and after exclusion of the cyclical factors, the essence of fluctuations is still pro-cyclical. Further research also shows that rural public expenditure has a significant spatial spillover effect on poverty reduction, which is even greater than the direct effect. Based on these findings, the policy implications can be that it is critical to provide moderate-scale and stable rural public expenditure, and establish a multi-level and differentiated agricultural insurance system supported by the government. This paper reveals the spatial interaction mechanism between public expenditure and poverty reduction, and also provides reference for correct evaluation of the economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

AB We use data from surveys on households and on banking regulation institutions to explore the impact of the access to financial services (AFS) on poverty, on a large sample of developing countries. Controlling for the presence of a possible endogeneity bias using the instrumental variable technique, we show that the AFS significantly reduces poverty. This result, which is robust to the use of alternative measures of AFS or poverty, and to the presence of many control variables, supports the need for an essential place of the AFS in the design of Poverty Reduction Strategies.

TI Child poverty and government policy: The contesting of symbolic power in
   newspaper constructions of families in need
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB News media play a central role in processes of symbolic power through which social issues are defined and solutions legitimized. This paper explores the role of newspaper coverage in the public construction of the New Zealand Government's Working for Families package designed to address child poverty. This package was criticized publicly by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) for targeting financial support to working families and neglecting families who derive their income from state benefits. We document the resulting news controversy through analyses of press releases from Government and CPAG, the accounts of journalists and representatives of CPAG, news reports and four focus group discussions with beneficiary parents. We propose that psychologists engage more fully with processes of symbolic power currently shaping public constructions of poverty and policy responses. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Pursuing sustainable development goals: A review of renewable energy and
   poverty alleviation nexus
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Reliable and affordable energy supply is the key to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at alleviating poverty. However, few studies explore renewable energy and poverty alleviation (RE-PA) practices and RE-PA nexus from a text mining perspective. This paper aims to find the research concerns of the RE-PA nexus and propose a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs. Topic modelling method and Latent Dirichlet Allocation model were adopted, and 5333 records were obtained from Web of Science and the 12-topic model was used to reveal the latent intellectual structure of the current research on RE-PA nexus. The results suggest that the top research concerns of the RE-PA nexus are sustainable energy development, country resource policy, and economic-environmental-social sustainability. Energy access of rural households, ecosystem services, and renewable energy performance are three essential future research directions. The top research concerns and future research directions would help to further explore the RE-PA nexus. This study could also provide a basis for integrated policy recommendations for renewable energy development and poverty alleviation while pursuing SDGs on energy and poverty.

TI Formal mining investments and artisanal mining in southern Madagascar:
   Effects of spontaneous reactions and adjustment policies on poverty
   alleviation
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB The main political concern in the southern areas of Madagascar is poverty alleviation. To alleviate poverty in the area, the government has chosen to enforce adjustment policies of the World Bank Group. According to the World Bank Group's argument, while artisanal mining is supposed to create significant economic, social and environmental problems, large-scale mining investment results in economic and social prosperity. This paper focuses principally on a re-analysis of the debates regarding the relationship between artisanal and large-scale mining and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Further, the paper offers an alternative viewpoint on these issues based on the example of Madagascar. In the last decade, Madagascar has experienced a significant increase in mining activity. Towards the end of the 90s, informal and artisanal mining emerged as one of the most important economic activities of the area with the development of the Ilakaka frontier. At the same time, foreign investments began to benefit from adjustment policies implemented by the government, and large-scale mining operations also commenced. As the local socio-economic system was deeply affected by these developments, it is wise to monitor the effects of each type of mining operation on poverty alleviation. On the one hand, it appears that governance insufficiency has hampered possibilities for broader economic prosperity through large-scale mining investments. On the other hand, while artisanal mining is frequently condemned by scholars, the negative comments seem to be overly pessimistic, as this activity can be demonstrated to provide considerable economic opportunities for both the native and migrant populations.

TI Does ICT diffusion reduce poverty? Evidence from SAARC countries
SO POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB The present study aims to explore the relationship between ICT diffusion and poverty reduction in SAARC countries using panel data from 2005 to 2020. This study uses econometric techniques robust to cross-sectional dependence (CSD) including Pesaran's CSD tests; second-generation unit root test; Pedroni, Kao, Westerlund cointegration tests; CS-ARDL, Driscoll-Kraay (DK) standard error approach; and D&H causality test. The investigation is based on the ICT diffusion index constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). The study's major finding shows that ICT diffusion reduces poverty both in the long and short run, indicating the favorable impact of ICT on the development process in SAARC countries. Further, economic growth, financial development, and remittances all serve to minimize the poverty level. The causality test reveals bidirectional causation between ICT diffusion and poverty reduction. The study highlights the crucial role of ICT diffusion and selected economic variables in reducing poverty. The findings of the present research shall benefit policymakers to formulate appropriate policies and programs to improve the well-being of people and enhance macroeconomic performance, which impacts both the societal and environmental development of a country.

TI Understanding the Influence of Latino Diversity over Child Poverty in
   the United States
SO ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The U.S. Latino population is diverse in terms of countries of heritage, citizenship status, languages spoken, generational status, and geographic settlement patterns. The likelihood of Latino children living in poverty is often associated with these features of Latino diversity; we challenge that view with analyses showing that the underlying economic conditions of families across demographic groups explain much of the likelihood that a child will experience poverty. We use data from the American Community Survey to examine the extent to which the associations between features of diversity and poverty are explained by differences in socioeconomic characteristics. We find that the relationship between parental heritage and child poverty is largely explained by socioeconomic characteristics. Parental citizenship and English language proficiency, while partly attenuated by socioeconomic characteristics, also have direct effects on the likelihood of a child living in poverty, suggesting that programs and policies may need to be tailored to support the economic well-being of these particularly vulnerable subgroups.

AB The article first surveys the debate about poverty measurement and recent poverty alleviation in India by focusing on the main contributions. The question of whether the economic reforms of the 1990s have accelerated or delayed poverty reduction, or possibly contributed to increased poverty, is addressed by using the state-level computations of the Human Development Index (HDI). It is shown that the HDI of the leading and lagging states converge and that the convergence accelerated in the 1990s. A functional relationship between the poverty index and the HDI is established and used to project the debated end-of-1990s poverty head count. The result confirms a slow-down in poverty reduction in the post-reform period.

TI Risk Factors for Persistent Child Poverty during the First Five Years of
   Life in Taiwan Birth Cohort Study
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Little is known about the child poverty dynamics in Asian countries. This study aims to learn the extent of persistent child poverty and identify its risk factors in Taiwan. Data for the analysis came from the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study, a nationally representative sample of 18,506 children who were born in 2005. The researcher defined poverty as parental income below $30,000 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) per month. We grouped children into three types of poverty based on their family's history: persistent poverty, occasional poverty and never poverty. This study presents a multinomial logistic regression of the relationship between risk factors and poverty types. In Taiwan, 6.0% of the sampled children experienced persistent poverty in the first five years of life. Persistent child poverty was associated with families experiencing chronic unemployment, parents with low educational attainment, mothers having children before the age of twenty-five, foreign-born mothers, single-parent families and residence in rural areas. Of these factors, parental work status and the educational level of parents are the most important determinants of child poverty.

AB There is a causal relationship between fragileness of ecological environment and poverty, which determines that the ecological environment construction and poverty alleviation must be balanced. This article analyzes the relationship between the construction and poverty through the examples of Yunnan Province, from the point of view of both the restoration of ecological system and the development of ecological economy, and puts forward the concrete measures of constructing ecological engineering, building eco-tourism areas and innovating new modes of labor transfer and so on. In the end, it is concluded that we need to carry out the ecological poverty alleviation better and provide policy support for effectively solving the problem of poverty and ecological environmental deterioration.

TI INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
AB In this paper the design of intergovernmental transfer schemes in a federation is analysed, focusing on schemes that can have a significant impact on improving interpersonal distribution in the sense of alleviating poverty.  It is argued that states with a lower income have larger concentrations of poor persons and that their ability to combat poverty is lower and their opportunity cost higher.  Federal transfers are not only a cost-effective means of enabling such states to undertake nationally optimal levels of poverty alleviation but also a way of ensuring that they actually do so.  The distribution of intergovernmental transfers in India during the seventh five-year plan is examined, and it is argued that general-purpose and specific-purpose transfers were inadequate and imperfectly designed from the perspective of poverty alleviation.

TI Climate Change as a Critical Factor to Poverty Reduction in Indonesia
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
CT International Conference on Education (ICOED)
CY APR 12-14, 2016
CL Jakarta, INDONESIA
AB Poverty reduction has been the top priority of the Indonesian government's developmental projects. At the age of climate change, however, the implementation of the policy faces greater challenges. Empirical observation gives rise to a question as to why do the climate change mitigation programs fail to bring about favorable effect to poverty reduction? The paper employs an intermestic approach to critically explaining the underlying problems concerning climate change and poverty reduction in Indonesia. The argument is that the political economy of climate change accelerates the existing structural factors which alienate the government from the poor people, and annihilates the moral relationships between the ruler and the ruled. To clarify this position, the discussion proceeds in two main parts. The first section outlines the significant use of the intermestic approach to analyzing the disconnection between climate change and the Indonesian government's economic policy to reduce poverty. The second section goes on to discern the structural factors which exacerbate the circumstances under which poverty reduction becomes a trivial issue in the ostensibly development policy directed to achieve economic progress. The concluding section reflects what can be learnt from the ongoing situation; on how to bring the state back into the right direction.

TI Child poverty, employment and ethnicity in the UK: The role and
   limitations of policy
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
AB In 1999, the British Government stated its resolve to end child poverty within a generation. In doing so it recognised both the extent of child poverty in the UK and the moral imperative to do something about it. At around the same time, a government study of ethnic minority employment was undertaken, which was to lead to the establishment of the cross-departmental ethnic minority employment task force (EMETF) and a Public Services Agreement target for the Department for Work and Pensions on closing the ethnic minority employment gap. Despite apparent overlaps between these two agendas, given that many minority ethnic group families have children, and worklessness is one of the main causes of child poverty ( though by no means the sole one), they were not really integrated. Nor has integration between them been seen - or encouraged - in European reporting processes covering topics linked to social inclusion and exclusion. In 2006, however, a link was made when the EMETF asked for a paper on child poverty to form the background to its work. This article builds on that initial link, discussing the intersection between child poverty and ethnic minority unemployment policy by illustrating the extent of child poverty as ethnically differentiated and exploring the ways in which it is related to aspects of employment. It goes on to consider the policy implications for both employment policy and income maintenance policy more generally, before examining the obstacles to an integrated approach both in terms of knowledge/understanding and the ways in which the two policy areas are conceived.

TI Influence of Digital Information Management on the Audit Path of
   Financial Special Poverty Alleviation Funds
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB In order to fully implement the Party's tough fight against poverty, conscientiously implement the policy of targeted poverty alleviation, and accelerate the development of the socialist market economy and the national economy, it is particularly important to strengthen digital information management in the audit of special fiscal poverty alleviation funds. With the continuous advancement of science and technology, the informatization of audit work has become an inevitable trend. However, in the past audit work of special financial funds, it was found that there were a series of problems such as imperfect audit system, weakened audit work, poor audit projects, imperfect supporting facilities, inadequate poverty alleviation funds, slow project progress, and failure to timely check the completion of projects. In order to better realize the timeliness and practicability of audit information of special fiscal poverty alleviation funds and solve the loopholes and deficiencies found in the past, based on the original digital information submanagement system, this paper adopts the J2EE system framework, MVC mode, and B/S security detection system to build a more stable, efficient, and secure financial special poverty alleviation fund management system. After a series of tests, under the premise of effective use of poverty alleviation funds, the system data shows that, from 2012 to 2018, the per capita disposable income of residents in poverty-stricken areas in China increased by 12.1% in nominal terms, an increase of 8.9% compared with 2012, and the gap between the national rural averages has narrowed again.

TI Child Poverty in Colombia: Construction of a Multidimensional Measure
   Using a Mixed-Method Approach
SO CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB This study presents the design and development of a multidimensional child poverty index in Colombia that can be used for assessment and policy design. Using a mixed-method design that combines quantitative and qualitative research methods, we developed a multidimensional measure of child poverty. Based on these results as well as empirical evidence on deprivations that are determinant for human development, we constructed a Multidimensional Child and Adolescent Poverty Index (MCAP). We used nationally representative household survey data to estimate the MCAP for 2008, 2010 and 2011 in order to measure changes over time.
   We found that overall, 34 % of children and adolescents in Colombia are living in poverty. This represents a 10 percentage-point reduction in comparison with 2008. As per the critical dimensions, we found that for all age groups lack of access to potable water, overcrowding and lack of access to parks or green areas contribute the most to child poverty. In addition, for children under five and adolescents, lack of access to education is a critical area and for children and adolescents, lack of access to recreational or time use services contribute significantly to poverty.
   We show how the MCAP can be used as a policy design tool for child poverty reduction that is sensitive to the needs of children from different age groups and regions through the design of benefit packages. Both the mixed-method research design and study findings are expected to have a significant impact across sectors including both academic national and international policy circles.

TI Poverty reduction strategy papers: A new convergence
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Poverty reduction strategy papers represent both a primary policy device of international development institutions, and an instance of a wider international convergence of public policy around global integration and social inclusion. Charting the emergence of these approaches, this paper argues that this convergence has a number of structural predilections which favor the technical and juridical over the political economic, and a disciplinary framework over a practical contest. Drawing extensively on decentralized governance and poverty reduction programs in Uganda, this paper shows how these predilections obscure power relations and restrict practical and political options, while exacting heavy establishment and compliance costs.

TI Analysis of Smooth Implementation of Industry Poverty Alleviation
   considering Government Supervision
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Vigorous implementation of industrial poverty alleviation is the fundamental path and core power of poverty alleviation in impoverished areas. Enterprises and poor farmers are the main participants in industry poverty alleviation. Government supervision measures regulate their behaviors. This study investigates how to smoothly implement industry poverty alleviation projects considering government supervision. A game model is proposed based on the evolutionary game theory. It analyses the game processes between enterprises and poor farmers with and without government supervision based on the proposed model. It is shown that poverty alleviation projects will fail without government supervision given that the equilibrium point (0, 0) is the ultimate convergent point of the system but will possibly succeed with government supervision since the equilibrium points (0, 0) and (1, 1) are the ultimate convergent point of the system, where equilibrium point (1, 1) is our desired results. Different supervision modes have different effects on the game process. This study considers three supervision modes, namely, only reward mode, only penalty mode, and reward and penalty mode, and investigates the parameter design for the reward and penalty mode. The obtained results are helpful for the government to develop appropriate policies for the smooth implementation of industry poverty alleviation projects.

AB Nearly 1 in 5 children in the United States lives in a household whose income is below the official federal poverty line, and more than 40% of children live in poor or near-poor households. Research on the effects of poverty on children's development has been a focus of study for many decades and is now increasing as we accumulate more evidence about the implications of poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently added "Poverty and Child Health" to its Agenda for Children to recognize what has now been established as broad and enduring effects of poverty on child development. A recent addition to the field has been the application of neuroscience-based methods. Various techniques including neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychophysiology, and epigenetics are beginning to document ways in which early experiences of living in poverty affect infant brain development. We discuss whether there are truly worthwhile reasons for adding neuroscience and related biological methods to study child poverty, and how might these perspectives help guide developmentally based and targeted interventions and policies for these children and their families.

AB The study investigated development gap in social policy and social problem interaction by examining impact of National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP) on rural communities in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to examine the relationship between non-participation of beneficiary communities in NAPEP project design at community level, corruption and policy implementation strategy on rural poverty reduction. The Ex-post facto research design was adopted to study communities in Oron and Udung Uko local government areas in Akwa Ibom State. Using a multistage sampling procedure, data were obtained from 400 respondents using Taro Yamene sample size determination formula. Data were analysed using Chi-square (X2) statistical technique. Main findings indicated that significant relationship exists between non-participation of beneficiary communities in NAPEP project design, corruption, policy implementation and poverty reduction in rural communities. The findings imply that NAPEP has not significantly achieved its goal of poverty reduction in rural communities. It has failed to elicit economic wellbeing priorities directly from target communities. Poverty can be reduced through accommodative and humanistic arrangements by allowing communities to identify welfare projects and eligible recipients. Rural dwellers have not experienced poverty reduction because of NAPEP development strategy gap.

TI Are universal measures sufficient in reducing child poverty in the
   Nordic countries? An analysis of policies and political commitments
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: The five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) have long traditions of social welfare policies that have eradicated poverty as part of their goals.The purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of why child poverty is still significant in the Nordic countries despite existing strategies. Methods: A qualitative analysis of Nordic government documents and reports between 2007 and 2019 was carried out to track changes in public health priorities and political measures and to determine the similarities and differences between the five countries. Results: In all countries, most of the measures were universal, such as benefits during pregnancy, paid parental leave before and after the child was born, paid parental leave related to children's sickness, child allowances, day care, free health care for children and support for disabled children. National policies aimed to reduce social inequalities and child poverty exist in all five countries, but unaffordable housing, unequal disposable family income distribution and unequal income distribution at local municipality levels seem to be obstacles to reaching national policy goals. Conclusions: Despite comprehensive universal measures to eradicate child poverty, inequalities are significant and increasing in some of the Nordic countries. This might be due to a lack of proportional universalism, where universal measures are in place in all Nordic countries, but with a lack of scale and intensity proportional to the children and families at risk. The significance of eliminating social inequalities needs to be emphasised at the local level.

TI Understanding resilience: Lessons from lived experiences of extreme
   poverty in Bangladesh
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB Motivation A large donor-funded programme in Bangladesh implemented multiple measures designed to graduate individuals and households out of extreme poverty. The programme was committed to lesson learning and advocacy. It monitored change through socioeconomic surveys, qualitative tracking methods, real time assessment and project evaluations. The qualitative tracking in particular shed light on the nature of extreme poverty and resilience.
   Purpose Is extreme poverty different from moderate poverty, and in what ways? Do the extreme poor experience more idiosyncratic poverty than structural or systemic poverty? Are the extreme poor more likely to be women and girls more socially isolated and marginalized due to their gender, thus impeding their capabilities? What support is needed to enable recovery and transformation from crises?
   Approach and methods Between 2011 and 2015, 72 life histories of households enrolled in a major poverty reduction programme were conducted, entailing repeated ethnographical engagement with informants. This showed how most households experience ups and downs in their poverty and vulnerability through time: an experience at variance with static understandings of hazards and responses. The limitations of resilience literature are thus critiqued to develop a new theory around time preference behaviour and discounting.
   Findings Experiences of extreme poverty are not solely a function of systemic, class-based inequality, but of the varied and reinforcing ways they intersect with idiosyncratic conditions of household life cycles, dependency ratios, gender and age balance, morbidity, ethnic discrimination and social isolation. Four key factors stand out as influencing deep poverty: (a) ill health, with significant internal opportunity costs; (b) intergenerational reproduction; (c) high incidence of female-managed and -headed households, resulting from male desertion; and (d) a lack of income diversity and security.
   Policy Implications Our findings provide fresh insights into policy responses to extreme poverty. These insights suggest a policy shift away from a narrow concern with graduation to a wider focus on resilience. Resilience as a poverty reduction outcome requires interventions that support individuals (micro level), target the intergenerational reproduction of poverty (meso level), and engage with wider power structures that exploit and neglect poor people (macro level). Policy-makers need to engage more explicitly with the meso and macro levels in particular, recognizing how the three levels converge to reproduce conditions of extreme poverty.

TI Analysis of the Effect of Social Capital on Household Poverty: Evidence
   from 2018 CFPS
SO GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB In the post-poverty eradication era, it is still important to increase the monitoring of urban and rural residents' poverty status and succession of poverty alleviation and protection policies. Taking social capital as the entry point, this paper uses the 2018 CFPS database to study the impact of social capital on household poverty, urban-rural heterogeneity, and the moderating effect of economic development, in order to provide a policy reference for further consolidating the results of poverty eradication. The results find that social capital can significantly reduce the probability of household poverty, and the poverty reduction effect on urban households is greater than that on rural households, while the level of economic development has a significant moderating effect on the reduction of relative poverty by social capital. The higher the level of economic development, the stronger the effect of social capital on the reduction of relative poverty of households. Accordingly, this paper proposes to play a leading role of the government, tilt infrastructure resources to rural and central and western regions, cultivate public spirit of urban residents, and create a favorable social media environment to increase social capital of urban and rural households; build official employment service platforms, actively cooperate with third parties, promote information sharing, and broaden employment channels for residents; and develop the economy and make a bigger "cake" to promote the role of social capital in poverty reduction.

TI The role of small towns in regional development and poverty reduction in
   Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
AB Ghana, like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, lacks a clearly articulated urban development strategy. Urban growth has been rapid but largely uncontrolled. Ghana's adoption of a decentralization programme in 1988 focused some attention on small towns. The country's more recent adoption of the Millennium Development Goals and other specific poverty reduction strategies requires more concerted state promotion of small towns. Improved service provision and delivery through small towns is a necessary component of any successful poverty reduction or regional development strategy.

TI Tourism and poverty reduction: Issues for small Island states
SO TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
AB The notion that tourism can contribute significantly to poverty reduction strategies is attracting great interest from multilateral institutions, tourism bodies, donors and other organizations around the globe. Tourism is certainly a major contributor to economic development in many small island developing states (SIDS) and often it is the only industry in these countries to consistently demonstrate growth in recent years. However, the growth of tourism in SIDS is by no means synonymous with poverty reduction, in fact, in some cases it entrenches existing inequalities. If tourism is to contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty in SIDS, a broad approach that values social sustainability as well as the more popular environmental sustainability and economic growth will be necessary. In addition, governments need to establish an effective policy environment and play a stronger regulatory role if sustainable, equity-enhancing tourism is to emerge. The paper suggests effective ways in which national planning can both encourage private sector actors to support poverty reduction and facilitate the involvement of wider sectors of society in tourism development. It is not sufficient for governments to simply promote tourism development in line with neoliberal growth -orientated policies.
